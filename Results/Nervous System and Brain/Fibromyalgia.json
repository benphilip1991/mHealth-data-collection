            "**UPDATE** after receiving response from customer support (which was expedient and right on the money for what I needed). I absolutely LOVE this app!!! (upgrade from 4 stars to 5!!) Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",
            "I started using this app because I know I will need a lengthy history to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I like how easy this app is to use and record my daily symptoms and over all how Im feeling. This app is super helpful.",
            "Love this. Most apps that track your activities etc are very limited without subscribing but this one has a lot of free features and is a great way of keeping track of patterns"

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

            "It is so important to be able to keep track of patterns when you have Fibromyalgia but due to the FibroFog, it can be quite difficult. I've spent months trying to figure out a convenient way to track on my own with no success. I'm so glad there is FINALLY an app that not only will track, but makes it easy to update. If you have Fibromyalgia (or another chronic illness that results in flares/PEM) you should give this a try. It also records what you log by day, so I can use it when I go to the doctor to show rather than failingly try to remember everything. Thank you for creating this much needed app; it is sure to help a lot of people to better manage their health.",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

Honestly I have so many treatments and symptoms that to remake this list every single day is extremely cumbersome. Therefore I no longer can use this app.",

I wanted to relate this to triggers causing pain and also to actions/Meds to reduce pain. This app did not seem to do that or had such a lack of intuitive design that it was all but useless. Changed to Manage My Pain app and found 100% better or more what I needed. Not really sure what this app is intended for.....",

Just the right pace to get you ready for more adventurous poses. Thank you.",

It's been around one and half month and already it has made a place in our daily routine. Kudos to team. Hoping to see more options in android version too as many are available in iOS version.",

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

            "Really Nice... and Cool Features... but for a Price I was excited to start using this app. There have been many times where I get ideas for art projects, and experience feelings that can only be described in the given moment. It's easy to add entries and do quick check-ins multiple times a day and I was psyched to see the other journaling ideas... Until I saw that you have to spend $30/year for those features. So cruel to ad them just to say, \"Pay us! Minus that, I would give it 5 stars.",
            "The app has more intelligent offer than I expected. First, it is a great interface to use on any devices, web, phone, tablet so I'm happy to be able to access it any time. The note is simply minimal and well organized. I'm surprised that there are actually promt checkins and guided templates for different topics for journaling. I'm using more than I intended.",
            "So far so good very simple to use and the design and layout is appealing. Better than most I've tried recently. Option to upload multiple photos in one go rather than individually would be handy, and the ability to upload videos would be nice. Great experience so far though.",
            "it is a really good app, ive only just started using it and is very good compared to other diarys and mood journals ive had in the past. it is good even without the subscription as you have access to the diary feature, mood board and everything. the only reason im giving 4 stars is because i feel that the mood board could be a bit more in depth that just, \"pick a face, what activities made you feel this way, any other notes.\" i feel it needs a little more but it is a great app and i recomend it!",
            "Pay to use... Listen, If you guy offer this for free with a very LIGHT ad presence so you can get paid for the work out into creating this app, fine. If you want to offer the option to pay like 1 or 2 dollars to get rid of the ads, fine. Even if you roll out new amazing content, I mean serious content that you can't find elsewhere, not fonts, themes, backgrounds, photo insertion or that simple bs. But telling me to pay over $5 monthly when I can buy a $1 notebook? No, that is money grubbing."

            "Noom puts the \"fun\" in \"functional\" plus it's easy to use! This app has short, informative articles that always make me chuckle. I lost weight right away during the 14-day trial, now I'm signed up for the next three months! This isn't like any other wellness app... you gotta try it for yourself to see just what I love about Noom. Totally worth it!!",
            "Originally thought I was getting my money's worth. But now they removed their built-in pedometer (which is the only device/app I was using) and they also removed the GPS tracking for when you do a workout and you want to know the distance you went (walk, hike, bike, etc). Very disappointed. I can't even accurately track my exercice anymore with this latest update they did! How am I supposed to figure out the distance I just hiked in order to punch it in manually? Ridiculous update.",
            "I absolutely love Noom! I've never had so much fun and success loosing weight! I love the tracking calories and seeing how many I have left, all the information they give you every day and the fun way they explain it, the coach, the group interaction! This is for me. I'm going to sign up my daughter too. I've only lost 9 pounds so far, but I know I'll stick with it and loose the rest ( unlike other diets) because I'm really enjoying it and learning so much. I love Noom!",
            "I absolutely love this! You learn how to eat better, and eat less. Noom helps you to be accountable for everything from nutrition to fitness! It is also motivational and you have a personal coach to help you along the way. You set realistic long term and short term goals for yourself. One thing that surprised me was I've always been a healthy eater, but with noom I realized I was eating way too dense. So far Ive lost 5 lbs and its the first week! If you put in the work, youll see results!",
            "So far mostly ok. Two main complaints: 1. Step tracking. Originally I set it up to sync with Fitbit and adjust goals daily, but it wasn't working so I tried to remove the link to Fitbit but now it only lets me choose a different app. I just want to log steps manually. 2. Why do they have you add on a meal plan and exercise plan but NOT have those integrated into the app? If I'd known in advance these would be just emailed to me and not really part of the program I wouldn't have gotten them."

            "Content is great... When I can access it. If I pause a recording it is very hard to get out to open again. I have to try repeatedly and don't know if it will work. I've given up and read the transcripts for some things but that doesn't work well for a meditation. Please fix these bugs!",
            "I think this is a brilliant app and my pain is so much more manageable after only a month. My reason for only giving 4 stars is that an awful lot of the work is going back to childhood. I have done years of therapy and I just don't need this so a lot of exercises etc are useless to me. Some brain training exercises and the somatic taking is really helpful... Building new neural pathways.",
            "As a musician, RSI has had a significant effect on me for years and finally now I'm able to play again. The app works on the premise that after the source of pain has healed, the sensation can remain because the brain gets stuck in a pain loop, exacerbated by anxiety and anticipation of the pain. The app is based on valid (and relatively recent) research and I'm delighted to say it has worked for me. Thank you Curable.",
            "Great concept but app needs some fixing I love curable and what they do. The content is great but sometimes my meditations stop playing somewhere half way and it ruins the whole meditation experience. Another thing is sometimes the shortcut for the meditation will stay on my drop-down in which nothing will make it disappear unless I restart my phone. Just a bug I'm assuming hopefully the developers fix this",
            "This app may help you. You will need to be able to tune your body to certain unknown frequencies and believe that the MRI study they refer to was not a flawed study from the start. If you are easily brainwashed this is the app for you. Worth a try if you are in constant pain. Good luck."

However this app is more than dealing with pain. It's about neuroplasticity which is now helping me eliminate vertigo and tinnitus. Definitely worth the subscription as they are constantly updating content.",

I am really shocked, in a good way. I am normally reluctant to pay for an app but compared to the thousands spent on gp, physio, chiro, pain medication, this is really not much. It has given me back some hope that my quality of life will improve which is priceless. I'll update the review after a few weeks, maybe even pain free!",
            "WOW the whole app changed since I been thinking of doing it. Is there no more old sessions? What happened to the old sessions? I know I tested the old 10 free sessions & loved them, but was not ready to use the app & now everything change. As well as why can't your app be moved to the sd card? It takes too much space on the internal space when you are low on space. The app keeps crashing because my phone is low on space as there is no way to move it to the SD card."

The only change I would like is a calendar view (instead of a list) so I can see several days at a glance & how many tasks I have for each day. I want to evenly spread out the house work so that I don't have too much on any given day.",
            "I have been using this app for well over a year and love it! The customizable tasks paired with the already made master list made it easy for me to begin using. I absolutely adore the timer function. Housework is a beast and with the timer I can make a game of the work and try to beat my own time. What I would really, really love is to link my personal cleaning list with other family members so they can mark theirs off when completed. We could even make a game of that!",
            "Best customizable app for cleaning that I've come across!! I like to be able to plan chores during my weekdays to keep my weekends free and divide it equally so it doesn't feel overwhelming. I searched through many many apps and none were able to offer what I needed. I absolutely LOVE this app and has taken stress off me being able to feel more organized and keep a clean home. Thank you so very much :)",
            "I've been using this daily for months now, it's exactly what I wanted. I had no real schedule for chores before, just did things when it seemed like they needed doing, and always forgot when exactly I last did something. Now I'm on top of everything, be it daily chores or those that only need doing every few months. It really makes my life easier and my house nicer.",
            "I absolutely love this app. The only thing I wish it would do is filter by over due days. I'd like to be able to see what is most over due first to tackle what is most needed first."

            "Works but free version sucks. All options are blocked. You can not do anything but play and stop. You have buy each app for access to get access just to rewind. Seems greedy when they claim to want to help. Not even free trial to see if blocked options are worth purchase.",
            "I have severe difficulty in falling asleep some nights, so bad that occasionally I'm up for 36 hours because I could not fall asleep at all. Also I've never been able to be hypnotized but last night I tried this app for the first time and within minutes of completing the First session I was asleep. Some nights it's pain that keeps me awake, and some nights it's my brain that won't wind down and allow me to rest and last night both were preventing me from getting to sleep until I tried this app.",
            "I've only spent $ to change the settings, so I'm only using the free track. I haven't noticed relief in my a.m. (fibromyalgia/arthritis) stiffness/achiness, but I sleep better. I also have ADHD, so focused relaxation and then hypnosis drop usually has me asleep quickly. I love how she phrases things (\"that all is just right\") and the slightly amused tone when she talks about toes. I've only gotten to the end 2x, and I've used the imagery during a nerve pain flare to calm it. Love this app!"

I still have depression, so I don't necessarily want to remove it from diagnoses, but I think I'll have to just so I can get the information I actually need.",
            "This app is overrun with spam, fake accounts, and people trying to scam others. There's also a number of people who are rude and abusive even though it's supposed to be a support app. Reporting people does nothing because the people are never removed even if several people report them several times each. And if someone harasses you in a DM there's no way to report it.",
            "very excited for this app to develop more with interface problems, everything else is perfect. i can't find a way to follow or even open people's community pages, so i'm pretty sure it's a glitch. hope it gets fixed ASAP as it really makes the app less useful.",

        "description": "This log can help you track the everyday things that have an impact on your pain. When you understand what makes your pain worse, you can begin to work on ways to reduce or deal with your pain “triggers.”\r\n\r\nThe more you know about how your body reacts, the more you can be in control. And being in better control can help you be less afraid and better able to manage your pain. \r\n\r\nThis app makes it easy to track your pain & symptoms and report to your doctors. Use our pain diary to keep track of your pain over time and share it with your doctor at your next appointment. Track a variety of pain elements, including location, pain duration, triggers and more.\r\n\r\nA pain diary is used to monitor levels of pain over a long period of time and collect data on possible triggers for that pain. One solution pain doctors recommend is keeping a pain diary, a consistent record of your pain experience.\r\n\r\nYour doctor will be looking for triggers, stresses, and patterns. The more detailed you can be about the factors that seem to influence your pain, the better. An accurate record of your pain will help your doctor give you the best treatment.\r\n\r\nWhy a Pain Journal Works for Chronic Pain\r\nThis information is useful both for you and your doctor. It can be used to help identify patterns of pain, such as time of day or level of stress, or pain triggers from certain activities. A pain journal can also show what doesn’t increase your pain, which can help you make better decisions about how you spend your day. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you log in a pain journal? Everybody uses their journal differently, but in this app you can do the following:\r\n- Give your pain a scale rating. We use the pain scale with the 0-10 rating system, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Your pain will usually fall somewhere in between.\r\n- Use pain descriptor words. Using pain descriptor words in your journal can help you track changes and patterns in your pain quality. It can also help doctors pinpoint your type of pain.\r\n- Track the time of day pain occurs. \r\n- Note what you are doing when your pain begins. \r\n- Look at elements that might contribute to your pain.\r\n- Write down what you ate and drank that day.\r\n- Describe your mood",

This one is great for keeping to show my pain management doctor because it's not so much information.",

HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",

This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",

            "I just downloaded this app, and I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews on many issues. First of all, I have MS, and I was looking for an app that will work my abs while sitting down. This app does not do this at all. It mainly works the arms. Then it does not have a voice magnetism at all only the music. You have to watch the screen to know what is next and how to do it. At hee end, the app stopped working. I am definitely uninstalling. Looking for another app for the abs.",
            "I love this app! I lost my entire left leg and have gone from an independent, active person to someone who has to rely on another for 80% of daily activities. This app has given me hope and encouragement that, even though life has totally changed, I can be active and feel positive about myself and what life will turn out to be!! THANKU SO VERY MUCH",
            "My daughter is very weak and problems standing. This app is wonderful, I just wish the exercises model moved a little slower. Thanks",
            "This was great for me. I haven't been able to get any excercises in for a long time due to health issues. I actually broke out in a serious sweat. Thanx for having this app",
            "Love this! I am recovering from double knee surgery and needed to find a way of exercising without causing pain or damage to my knees. My hear rate was raised and it's really fun to do ! Obviously the more effort you put in, the more you're going to get out of it"

            "I often hear the sound skip, like it suddenly stops and starts, repeatedly every night at random intervals. I've also woken up in the night to realize it stopped working altogether. I've tried restarting the app, closing all apps and reopening it, and restarting my phone, but it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and I don't think I can justify the purchase until it's fixed.",
            "To put it bluntly: this app rocks! Honestly! I've tried multiple apps such as this, but none of them had a feature where you could add music to ambient noises, not music of the type this app has. Due to personal reasons, I suffer from relentless insomnia, but this was literally my \"Ultimate Sleep solution\"! Every megabyte sacrificed for this app was worth it!",
            "I love this app. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have recently started having problems wit the app. It stops about 2 hours after I start it. I have purchased the premium package when I first got it, and it played all night. Now it doesn't. I love hearing music all night, it helps me sleep, so when it stops I wake up.",
            "Love this app and it's been a huge aid to sleep. I used to toss and turn for an hour or more, but now I almost always fall asleep well before the 45min timer turns off my favoured sound. There's a great variety of sounds too, lots more than other apps I've tried and much more realistic. I only use a few, and the one that works best for me is Gentle Rain so I tend to stick with that one. I paid for the full selection and was happy to (its just a small one-off fee) to get the variable timer.",
            "ABSOLUTLY 5+ STARS This is by far the best app I have ever used. The sounds are very authentic. You can download many sounds at the same time and save to your favorites. I enjoy so much, that I purchased the premium.Good deal.You won't regret it. I'm sleeping the best I ever have. Thanks to the Ultimate Sleep App. I have tried many others and none of them even come close.💯❤"

            "I payed for a month just to try it out fully. It's a very pleasing app to use, the ui looks very elegant and it actually feels like Chiku is asking me questions rather than me just ranting onto the paper. The o ly complaints I have are that it's going to be a massive pain to scroll to old stories and I feel as though the daily reads (for me) aren't too useful. Really great app! I'm considering buying the lifetime plan hoping this app doesn't get discontinued.",
            "Very nice app. It's more than an app. It's a safe space🌌. Meditation is very nice. The quotes are very good of course!! Im in love with this app. The themes are all so good. Writing here is so easy!! Love it.",
            "Easiest app to use. It is enough options to declare all your feelings and mood conditions, also, if you want you can add a written description about what's going on.",
            "This app is amazing. I love how it reminds you to add a new story every day. Idk how to explain but everything is perfect.",
            "I'd like to visit my previous entries with more ease. Please let me view them more easily without having to scroll sideways a lot. Also a go-to feature where you can find specific entries besides the filter would help. Also it would be nice to be able to save community blogs and daily quotes that inspired you. Maybe save them somewhere so you can access them any time. I also have experienced difficulty downloading the pdf versions of my entries."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "It's helpful to be able to access my records, including lab reports, in one secure place. O also like that I can send/receive messages, request refills, and use the portal for televisits. I have linked my Fitbit tracker to the site, so my daily exercise, sleep, and weight can be seen by my physician. The app is easy to use on my phone and laptop. Thank you!",
            "I wish I could give this zero stars.. Absurdly difficult to use. Terrible. Takes forever to set up. And when you get your own results there's no explanation of what they mean. Difficult to find anything. Slow. Very tiny font with poor contrast with background. Easier to just call and get results. Even if you have to wait 30 minutes. I HATE THIS APP! I HATE THIS APP!",
            "Several features do not work - cannot schedule appointment, limited devices support for health monitoring Syncing with external devices is very difficult or impossible due to limited devices - no sleep sync, no weight sync, no blood pressure sync, will not sync with Samsung Health app, not Samsung smartwatch - Active 2. Overall the app takes more time than it's worth to use. Do NOT Recommend this app. Tell your healthcare provider not to consider it for their patient access.",
            "To get to the waiting room, I had to go through the vitals entry screen first. I dont know my vitals when doing a televisit from home. I had to call to find out that you just leave them blank and go on through that screen to wait for provider to come on. Seems awkward and not obvious (user friendly) to me. Otherwise I love doing provider visits this way as I live 5 hours away from this specialist with no others near me.",
            "GREAT APP!!!! I really like having access to my records especially my med list, co-pays AND Medication Timers!!! I have used the Televisit option since the beginning of the year. It is very easy. I LOVE having the ability to have a Video appointment with my physician. Great App!!! I would give more stars if possible... Grateful in New Mexico"

This app's worth 10-20 dollars, but Dr. Watkins gives it away...incredible. It had already helped me indescribably, just in the one week I've used it. If you didn't catch it, they paid (apps are expensive) to put their world-class rehab program into an app, the same they use with famous athletes, and GAVE IT AWAY. Dr. Watkins deserves thanks and a medal. Thanks Doc!",

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

        "title": "Back Pain Tracker",
        "description": "The best treatment for one patient may be different from the one that works best on average. Guidelines and conventional decision aids provide average treatment effects and suggestions based on the average patient. However, each patient has unique characteristics that may affect benefits and risks. Back Pain Tracker is an interactive app that helps personalize treatment.\r\n\r\nBack pain is a major and growing source of pain and disability.  The Institute of Medicine included “Comparing the effectiveness of treatment strategies for low back pain without neurological deficit or spinal deformity” in the top quartile of 100 research priorities in 2009. In U.S. national surveys, LBP is the most frequent type of pain, reported by about half of adults in the past year.  It accounts for 34 million office visits annually to primary care physicians. An estimated 7 million adults have activity limitations due to low back pain. It is considered one of the most vexing health problems of our time. Back pain most commonly occurs without leg numbness or weakness and cannot be reliably attributed to a specific cause (“non-specific back pain”). The optimal strategy for treating such patients is uncertain. The efficacy of treatments is moderate at best. A significant proportion develop persistent disabling pain despite use of first-line therapies such as analgesics, exercise therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy. Invasive treatments and surgery have limited efficacy and significant risks. Our goal is to help each patient with back pain choose the treatment that is right for them, and engage patients for long term self-assessment using Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)scores, potentially for more than 5 years, when many patients start reporting deterioration in pain and function following back surgery. BPT has the potential to help improve outcomes for patients with back pain.\r\n\r\nBPT as an interactive technology to help patients with personalized Shared Decision Making (SDM) in conjunction with their healthcare providers on the appropriateness of the wide range of treatments available for back pain. Too frequently patients are unable to match their treatment decisions with their preferences because they do not fully understand the risks and benefits of the different options. Patients frequently hold mistaken beliefs about their diagnosis and risks/benefits associated with treatments. BPT helps align an individual patient’s values and preferences with the patient’s treatment choice through SDM. Unique features of great significance in the BPT are: (1) providing patients with information that balances risks and benefits of treatment options, (2) eliciting preferences based on realistic goals of care, and (3) integrating PROs in the decision-making process at the point-of-care.\r\n\r\nThe application was developed through a user-centered design approach to design the user interface for ease of use by patients in entering PRO data and to present time-trended PROs that are understandable for patients, including personalized estimates of normative outcomes based on patients’ age, sex and other features.

PROs developed by the NIH Task Force on Research Standards for Chronic Low Back Pain and the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Computer Adaptive Tests (PROMIS CATs) interact with and “feed” the SDM process.

        "descriptionHTML": "The best treatment for one patient may be different from the one that works best on average. Guidelines and conventional decision aids provide average treatment effects and suggestions based on the average patient. However, each patient has unique characteristics that may affect benefits and risks. Back Pain Tracker is an interactive app that helps personalize treatment.<br><br>Back pain is a major and growing source of pain and disability.  The Institute of Medicine included “Comparing the effectiveness of treatment strategies for low back pain without neurological deficit or spinal deformity” in the top quartile of 100 research priorities in 2009. In U.S. national surveys, LBP is the most frequent type of pain, reported by about half of adults in the past year.  It accounts for 34 million office visits annually to primary care physicians. An estimated 7 million adults have activity limitations due to low back pain. It is considered one of the most vexing health problems of our time. Back pain most commonly occurs without leg numbness or weakness and cannot be reliably attributed to a specific cause (“non-specific back pain”). The optimal strategy for treating such patients is uncertain. The efficacy of treatments is moderate at best. A significant proportion develop persistent disabling pain despite use of first-line therapies such as analgesics, exercise therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy. Invasive treatments and surgery have limited efficacy and significant risks. Our goal is to help each patient with back pain choose the treatment that is right for them, and engage patients for long term self-assessment using Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)scores, potentially for more than 5 years, when many patients start reporting deterioration in pain and function following back surgery. BPT has the potential to help improve outcomes for patients with back pain.<br><br>BPT as an interactive technology to help patients with personalized Shared Decision Making (SDM) in conjunction with their healthcare providers on the appropriateness of the wide range of treatments available for back pain. Too frequently patients are unable to match their treatment decisions with their preferences because they do not fully understand the risks and benefits of the different options. Patients frequently hold mistaken beliefs about their diagnosis and risks/benefits associated with treatments.

I'm sure it's just because I just started, my only suggestion wouldukd be to show a quick animation between moves, or que as to what is next. Sometimes I am scrambling to quickly move into the next one. I imagine as I keep going I'll just know what each move is though. So awesome!!",
            "I love Jillian, she pushes you while motivating you. This app is great, it has a ton of variety and you can modify to whatever equipment you have and for your fitness level. With that being said, I only gave 3 stars because the app is glitchy. For something I have to pay for, I'm disappointed that so many things don't work well. I'm leaving this review today because I just finished a workout in which majority of the videos didn't work so I didn't exactly know what to do. Please fix this.",
            "There have been a few issues with the app, but the support always replies fast and is working on solving them and improving the performance. Thank you! Great app. So many programs to choose from, the exercises are so good and excellent advice about food and healthy diet with many recipes. I would highly recommend. This app is a life changer.",
            "I love the variety this app offers and I'm a fan of Jillian's style of workouts. I've knocked off a star for a few reasons, though. There are glitches, including one I encounter at least once a week in which I skip to the last cooldown exercise and it resets the whole workout like I never did it. That is very frustrating. Even more annoying is that now the volume of my music changes during the workout. I found this distracting and I could barely hear it most of the time, then it becomes loud.",
            "Love the app, have been using is for 4 mos now! I like the different exercise options and meal plans. It is nice that there are beginner option exercises, too. I love the new beginner yoga! There is also a calendar to track your progress. There have been a few random days where the app freezes and gets glitchy but overall I think its a good, useful app!"

Yes, obviously it's you, unless there's another entry on Google play called injury map which strangely charged my card that I signed up to your app with that I evidently have on my phone... Or I wouldn't be able to post a review, would I? Further it is $79.99 NZ I have been charged. I will happily post pictures.",
            "This is a life changing app that I'd recommend to everyone! Having been through many years of severe lower back issues and visited a range of specialists, only Injurymap has had a significant impact, with its daily activities, check ins after every step, and slow progress towards pain free movements.",
            "Using this app as I have a sore achilles. Found the exercises great and progressive. Has really made a difference. I will use this app. in the future as it definitely helps.",
            "Developer honestly states the cost ($3.49/mo or $23.99/yr) and describes the app in description.👍 I have not paid or used the app beyond free access, but being honest is very important, so I'm assuming developer is honest about parts of app that can't be freely used. Free access allows you to read the general program description and the 'Tips' section.",
            "The workouts seem to be well planned and truly helpful for rehabilitation. But the app has bugs and has lost my progress twice now... At this pace I will never be able to get past Phase 1. For a paid app I'm expecting no obvious bug like this that affects usability."

And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",
            "Paid premium, and didn't recieve. Sending questions and suggestions via email, and Facebook. No answer because they are closed on weekends. This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

            "Excellent app! This has been an awesome introduction to yoga for me, it's private, at your own pace, peaceful, engaging! The UI is super easy and intuitive, really a blessing! For anyone wanting to get into yoga it's a great no pressure place to start that also helps to keep you on track with a schedule. I HIGHLY recommended it!",
            "Very nice and useful app. I'm just a beginner and I'm already loving the app. Waaay better than the other yoga apps. Even the classes are layed out well. The kriya points makes it even interesting to unlock new classes. Only problem is with the background music. I need to turn off the background music inorder to hear the instructions clearly(keeping background music on makes tge yoga soothing and calm). Thats it. Satisfied with everything else... Kk I wrote a little too much...;-)",
            "I am totally new at yoga. So this is going at a pretty good pace and perfect for a beginner. Looking forward to completing this program and trying more advanced ones in the future weeks and months. I like the video in addition to speaking the directions clearly to be able to follow without having to have too many disruptions or memorizations.",
            "Great! No ads interrupting the session and no asking for my payment info. No complaints so far. The only thing that I believe would push this further is making the settings options a bit more user friendly and having the option to change the music up. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this so far :)",
            "I downloaded this app the end of March(2020) when UK lockdown started. Using it since there is no fault. I enjoy all the daily exercises, every day Is is different, so it's not boring. I was a total beginner, never done yoga before do some of the poses are really challenging, but It doesn't upset me. My flexibility improved a lot but still not there where the guy on the videos."

To my knowledge, there aren't alternative developmental milestone charts even available. Which is really frustrating, for example of course my blind child is not pointing at pictures of the animals in books. But, there's no alternative Milestone checklist available for her. So, this really wasn't very useful for our family as most of our children have special needs",

        "description": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \r\n\r\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \r\n\r\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \r\n\r\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \r\n\r\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\r\n\r\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \r\n\r\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \r\n\r\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\r\n\r\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \r\nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \r\nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section.",

A cause of yet more pain, rather than less. HOWEVER with 24 hours of contacting their site, Mark Grant the creator and proprietor himself had emailed me with unequivocal accecceptance of the problem AND total assaurance that it would be rectified absolutely ASAP. As indeed it was, with a further 24 hours. With commitment and integrity like that from the App's creator themselves, in tandem with the excellent quality of the App and it's otherwise easy to use functionality, the least I can give it is the maximum FIVE STAR rating.",

            "Buyer beware ... despite the title, only a few of the pain control tracks incorporate EMDR (Bls) technology and the tracks for \"intense pain\" all require the cooperation of another person acting as a pseudo-physical therapist ... if you read the app description on this page you will find tge developer coyly refers to this second human participant as an \"outside material.\" Shame on you Grant, chronic pain suffers are in the forefront of groups of people who shouldn't be exploited.",

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

On your about page you have words like yarning instead of yawning, that needs to be change. There are a few more edits needed, but that jumped off the page.",

Worth it for medical professionals and their patients/clients right across the entire pain spectrum to start the \"self\" rediscovery journey to self management with little to no medical intervention. What a gift for all of us who suffer 24/7 with these horrible & debilitating \"invisible\" (& therefore usually dismissed, belittled & not often believed) chronic/complex nerve pain syndromes. Maybe this could even help save some lives. Going to share the hell out of this app to get the word put. Well done Development Team! .. Thankyou",

It's hard to rely on memory alone or write when having an illness so this is a really quick way for me to record for all my doctor's.",

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

        "description": "Mood Tracker ✅ - Year in Pixels ✅ - Diary ✅ - Habits ✅ - Gratitude Journal ✅ - Routines ✅ - Photo Album ✅ - EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR GOOD MENTAL HEALTH IN ONE APP! ✅\r\n\r\nMoodflow is a beautiful, modern and FREE app that captures your emotions, moods, thoughts, and general well-being. In addition, Moodflow goes along with you throughout your life, and gives you a deeper understanding of yourself, not previously known to you. Ultimately, this will allow you to improve your mental health and help you become a better you.\r\n\r\n🤗 HOW DOES MOODFLOW WORK? \r\nYou do not even need to write anything down to get a meaningful insight or to keep a diary.\r\n\r\nThis is how easy Moodflow works:\r\nFill out a quick survey every day and gain insight into the WHAT and HOW it influences you over time.\r\n\r\n• 1. Pick a rating for the day from 1 to 5.\r\n• 2. Pick the emotions you experienced.\r\n• 3. (optional) Write a note about everything important from the day.\r\n• 4. (optional) Pick the activities you did during the day.\r\n• 5. DONE! 😁\r\n\r\n👀WHAT WILL THIS DATA DO FOR ME?\r\nAs time goes by, these short entries will gather insightful data about yourself that you will be able to analyze in many ways. On the one hand, a Calendar will be filled with colors that reflect your emotional well-being. This will allow you to get an eagle-eye perspective on your life that you never had before. On the other hand, Moodflow comes with data-analyzing tools, that will help you find relationships between a plethora of different factors and your mood. Moodflow will help you understand yourself better by allowing you to identify the things that bring you up ↑ or those that pull you down ↓.\r\n\r\n👏WHAT ELSE CAN MOODFLOW OFFER?\r\nAdditionally, Moodflow encourages you to develop better habits by including 28-day challenges. These challenges have different levels of difficulty and will ensure that you create simple but powerful habits. As some have claimed: \"We are what we repeatedly do.

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

            "Started using the app this week. It was straight up easy to use, and super easy to add an entry when needed (which I am like every few hours) so it's not a chore to use. The layout is simple and clear, making it easy to track what's going on. Only two things I would change: 1) The massive cartoon image that's always there on the home screen. Purely because it's unnecessary and I just don't like it. 2) The fact you can't delete preprogrammed logs, but apparently in the next update that will change",
            "Very useful, but some limitations... I like the flexibility of the categories and options--lots of ways to fine-tune the information you record. I'd *really* like records to be editable, though... it's annoying not to be able to correct or amend a symptom record, for example--you just simply have to delete it and start all over again. Also, if I try to enter notes with voice-to-text, it won't take the resulting text... just leaves it blank. I'd like more charting options, but that's just picky.",
            "Just started using it but love it! Its easy to use, you can customize it, you can track different aslects of your symptoms by graph (which will be handy when the doctor asks, \"How ofyen does this happen?\"), and you can write notes to further explain things if need be. This is just what I was looking for!",
            "So far, exactly what I was looking for! Just wanted something to track symptoms from my autoimmune disease when i get them. This is so easy to use. And so easy to add new symptoms. And sub categories for those. The recently used feature is great. And took me 1 seconds to figire this app out and has all the features i was hoping for. Ive only had it an hour..but so, far its perfect!",
            "I like the app and use it to track a variety of things. There are a lot of little things that should be improved. It frequently fails to open. A phone reboot is required then all is well. There is a prepopulated list of meds and foods, you can add anything you want but you cant fix them once you use them and you cant shorten the list by getting rid of preloaded ones you dont need. Trends fails to put in datapoints for zero occurances."

One time it did that and it erased everything that I typed. when I select a logged mood/activity, it pulls up the screen for the day. It will say \"no logs.\" I can only view the moods by viewing by week, or viewing a day after the actual day of the mood. For example, a mood on Aug 31 will show on Sept 1",

            "I've tried a few migraine trackers, and I think I like this one the best. Its relatively simple to figure out and I like that I can add my own descriptors for pain/symptoms, location, and triggers. I wish there was a way to kind track possible triggers as I'm not always sure what has caused my migraines. However, I just list all the options possible for that migraine in particular in order to try and figure things out from there.",
            "Useless, tried it once and deleted it. (Better off using migraine buddy instead if u have migraines or diagnosed medical issues) This is completely pointless-for example, there are no migraine/headache medications listed under medications other than asprin, tea & coffee??? There are not even basic triggers listed under triggers. Completely and utterly useless.",
            "Seems to lack an important feature...or maybe I just don't know how to use it. I'm talking about recording the progression of a headache. For instance, it stars off as a three but within an hour, it's 6. But all you seem to be able to do is to change the number without keeping the old score, which means that your final record will show that all your headaches started as 6 and did not develop gradually. Please tell me if I missed something as otherwise the app is really easy to use and v. good",
            "I just used this app for the first time today. It was relatively easy to use and self-explanatory. However, at the end of the day I needed to edit that particular migraine and I could not find a way to edit what I had posted earlier in the day. 🙁",
            "I really like this app. It tracks my headaches, but I also keep track of what I eat every day to see if food might be a trigger. The only reason why I didn't give this app 5 stars is that I wish when I record a headache of 0 severity it would be counted as not a headache...otherwise a great app. Highly recommended!"

Has helped tremendously in setting up a simple stretching routine to help with my recovery from a back injury.",
            "I've been using this app for my back for years. I didn't realise I hadn't rated it!! Great app. It's really helped me with my back pain as I have a bad posture. In particular I always use the \"Stretching the spine\" exercises.",
            "At my age and 40 really only concentrated on upper body weight training in past. Thankyou so much for this app! Good option for a simple workout or with an added workout! Life saving stuff, encouraging and easy to follow and stay focused.",
            "I suffer from lower back pain ever since I got sciatica from a back injury. These small workouts actually work better than my rehabilitation workout. A minor delay between the rep countdown and the animation, but better to work at your own pace anyway and do how many you're comfortable doing.",
            "It is a great app to work on all parts of your body. The only disadvantage is that when you want to make your personal plane is gets difficult to order the exercises. I mean moving them up and down one by one is time consuming."

            "Having back pain on a daily basis, I have tried these excercises out of desperation . They do work great to alleviate back pain . Even better than pain relievers and i cant tell you how happy I am about this app. Theres only a few excercises, so you can learn them quickly. Now that I do them regularly, it helps stop my back pain BEFORE it starts. I strongly recommend this app to anyone suffering from mild to severe, occasional or chronic back pain. Try it...I guarantee you'll be glad you did.",
            "Great concept! I would suggest verbal instructions, as it is nearly impossible to view the excercises being displayed while doing them. Also, a time gap between the exercises and rest periods of about 10seconds would be more convenient, as this gives one opportunity to switch positions, without having to pause. I would also suggest displaying the exercises (and their demos) before the session starts, as to allow the user opportunity to familiarise themselves with the excercises and do them well!",
            "Good app ,& easy could be better. I like the 6mins just enough to get the chair kinks out. Cannot set to repeat every couple of hours. This needs cues like chimes or dings to tell how long to hold each pose in order to follow avatar without having to constantly keep eyes on the phone, annoying! Transition from resting to next exercise is too fast, is frustrating, and must rush to catch up. That's the reason for stars. Would pay for a pro version if this app was a bit more intuitive.",
            "Very good. Also why did you cut short your per session exercises to 3?. I love the old way of doing all the exercises at once. Please see if you can include all of them.",
            "So cool, there're lots of exercises useful, also has access youtube link to do correct the exercises from trainers. Thanks for all for this app creators 👍👍👍"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "This makes absolutely no sense to have on subscription and the lifetime cost is an exorbitant $34.99. It's just a searchable list. You could easily just convert this into a spreadsheet. Obviously a lot of apps like this are being created just to prey on people's problems as opposed to actually helping.",
            "Great app, however I would have given you $3 - $4 for a permanent unlock with no ads. But $69 for lifetime access ! Someone thinks too highly of their glorified list displayer. Let me just burrow your JSON db from GitHub and I'll create my own free version.",
            "I have GERD, and relatively my body rejects many foods, and this app is PERFECT for helping me know which foods I should have and shouldn't have, I hated having to experience my body disliking and rejecting the food for myself, but with this app I no longer have to try things and deal with the consequences, with a click of a button I can see if it'll cause my body to react or not!! And it even lets you know which foods are remedies! Overall this app is great and can really come in hand😁",
            "Not anything I didn't know already once I paid for premium. I was under the impression it would be a diary I could log my trigger foods and tailor my diet. The ingredients aren't elaborate enough it's quite broad. It's basically a paid list on subscription its not worth it at all. Subscription is pointless.",
            "I consider it a really great app. It's nice to have it on hand for a quick search when you're in the grocery store and try to sort things while dealing with acid reflux. Plus it is really great that they continue to update it and give the option to ask for requests for the future list. One thing I hope they'll add in the future is ingredients as well. I constantly look at the list of ingredients for everything, and I'm always nervous with things like malic, folic and ascorbic acid."

It appears to assume you're logging after a migraine has happened and that they don't last for more than 24 hours when in fact some last for days or even weeks. Additionally it assumes that medications are only used as an abortive measure instead of as maintenance to prevent. Will be seeking an app that better fits my migraine patterns with more in depth tracking abilities.",

It is a little clunky to understand how to customize them, but easy to do once you find out. I like that you can track very easy and the graphs you can get with it. All with the free version!",

            "I love the app and the variety of practices I can do. I get bored of doing the same thing very quickly, so always having a new session whenever I open the app is great. More than the app itself, though, I love the developers. The people who run Down Dog are some of the most passionate and considerate on the planet. They truly care about their users and are willing to do almost anything to ensure they are satisfied. (if you don't believe me, check out their twitter.)",
            "perfect balance of variety and consistency. works when I want an intense workout or gentle stretches. videos show poses clearly, though it may still take a few tries if you are new to yoga. my favorite feature is the 'boosts' option, which changes up the poses you get to better focus on one area. for me, totally worth the money.",
            "I've used this app for over 2 years now, and can finally say I've incorporated all of their apps into my routine, its very customizable, the music choices are fantastic, and I've progressed in all my practices vigorously (lost over 30lbs since I started in 2018) and it has even encouraged me to take this a step further and make a career out of it! I've never thought I'd be obsessed with yoga and now I'm so excited to teach it myself! I wouldn't be where I am now if it weren't for Down Dog!",
            "I love this app! It helps make practicing yoga much more accessible for me. I can practice at home as well as when I travel. The poses and stretches are demonstrated and explained well, very comparable to an in-person class. And the instructor voices are so relaxing. The sessions are super customizable to fit any of my needs. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to fit practicing yoga in any sort of schedule.",
            "This app is the best! There is a variety of music you can select, different yoga instructor voices to listen to, different yoga to follow, a variety of moves/stances, and it's so user friendly. You can also select target areas to focus on, which I do my lower back because I sometimes I have lower back pain from sitting all day for work. It is perfect for someone who wants to go yoga whenever, wherever like me! Amazing app ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

            "The service is AMAZING! I have no regrets using this app to chat with a doctor for something quick. The reason I knocked 2 stars off though is the AI at the start of EVERY chat. It only lists symptoms and takes you through a very thorough, automated chat session. If you are someone who doesn't know what you're dealing with it would be really useful, however in any case where you know your issues, such as Asthma and you're in need of a simple prescription/refill - it'd be nice to skip it.",
            "These doctors are awesome! They listen to you and help you! I didn't think it was real at first. But I had an ear infection and a doctor wouldn't see me for a month. So I tried this and they called in ear infection meds instantly and they said 3-4 days before your better but I started feeling better in an hour! Excellent app!! Thank You for having this available. Highly recommended!!!",
            "My experience was great!! I'm so glad this worked just like it's promised to. I paid for the service of $19 and was given a receipt through email. After downloading the app I answered some questions about my issue, took maybe 10 minutes, and was then directed to a certified doctor. She asked me a few questions and sent the prescription I needed to the pharmacy of my choice. I called to verify if they'd received it and sure enough it was and being filled. I highly recommend this service!!",
            "Its okay, but it always takes you to worst case scenario. Like I have pain in my ribs. Localized, no fever, no headache, no chills, no sneezing, no coughing, no shortness of breath, wasn't near anyone sick... It told me I either had an upper respiratory or pneumonia. I actually somehow tore the cartilage between the ribs, likely from lifting something too heavy. Bruised ribs wasn't even a suggestion.",
            "Very user friendly simple AI. Very cool AI also asks your symptoms to help diagnose incase one is a closet hypochondriac.suppose one could get a subscription monthly and just see what one might MAYBE could sorta kinda have. If that were the case just saying cause I thought it was superfluous knowing already what I had and what I needed medication for but for real diagnosis there is the option to speak to a dr. And if possible they prescribe a medication for you and send it to your pharmacy"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Its nice that there is a calendar to keep track of your progress. Not too sure is calories burned is correct since every person is different, but still a good motivation tool. Morning, Afternoon and Evening is a plus as is multiple other categories ."

            "Updated Review: the issue with restarting the monthly challenge has been resolved meaning I upgraded my review from 4 to 5 stars. This app does what it's supposed to with no promises of insane growth. You gotta put in the effort and challenge yourself and you will feel the changes in no time. Especially with these often underworked muscles.",
            "Great app! The exercises are great they target the needed muscle groups, and another reason why the app is great is that there arent many back -at home workout (no equipment) on youtube, and thats why i vot it in the firsr place. The reason i dont give 5 stars is that theres always room for improvements ;) Cheers",
            "The app is great it shows great representations of how to do the workout like insteas of showing a cartoon figure it shows a a really impressive 3D model of the a person doing the workout your supposed to be doing the downside is that it doesn't tell you tips on if your doing the workouts correctly or not but so far my workouts have been hard which means i was doing them correctly i think but overall this is a great app i think if anyone interested in back and shoulder muscles should get it",
            "This app has helped me so much with my back pain! I used to be in constant pain and having used this app for nearly a week, it's all but gone! I also love that it has easy, medium and hard modes, a lot of similar apps only have one mode that a beginner like me would find too difficult - but not this one, I like it a lot. (Although there are a few exercises in it that require a little more space than I have in my tiny bedroom)",
            "It's a great exercise app that lets you keep making progress on your own by letting you choose the exercise time , so there's no more excuses about not having time to work out. I would of given 5 stars but the lack of a voice coaching you if a little bit of a let down because if you're working out at home you need to keep an eye out for your phone otherwise you'll miss the end of an exercise and the begging of another one."

            "Really like the idea and execution. My only negative observation is when you say I'm not feeling quite right and input none covid symptoms it then asks where you are. The 4 options given are too limited and do not include at work, other or give you the option of skipping. This forced me to enter false info. If there was a way to avoid doing this I could not easily see it (I went through twice to see).",
            "The concept and app are amazing and I try to make sure I complete the question every day, but there seems to be a bug (I'm not sure if it's specific to OnePlus - I have a 7t Pro and it's always been like this) where the last character or two in a line of text get cut off. Whether it's the case numbers, or even the name of the area I live in, it seems to happen.",
            "The app has stopped asking questions about how often I've been out for [this or that]. So I stopped keeping track. If that's a bug, FYI. If it's on purpose, nevermind. I long ago stopped reporting symptoms when I know thay don't mean covid. One I've had near daily for over a decade. Reporting it brings irrelevant covid-related questions. A cough at night goes away when I'm up for the day. Same problem. So I back out and say I'm fine. Too many \"symptoms\" suggest covid, regardless of reality.",
            "SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS: this is a great app and it feels so good to be helping! I suggest a revision that makes it easier and clearer how to report for multiple people. Right now you have to click \"done\" and then \"report today\" each time you want to report for an additional person. I suggest that for people who are reporting for self and others that after reporting for one person the app returns to the \"select profile you want to report for\" screen.",
            "I Like it, but as per other reviews, my Oneplus 6T is cutting off the data screens. \"42\" cases in my area reported on my phone, \"425\" on my wife's. - which btw is born out be the graphs. Also today - we're getting a 525 error both Android and Apple - is there something wrong with the backend? how do we report it? how do we find out? Difficult to find contact details. Nevertheless a useful tool and good information supplied in the blogs"

I'm supposed to do 3 days per week, both shoulders, 2 sessions, 15 reps per session with resistance bands and eventually increase the reps and resistance. I couldn't get it to show less than 5 days per week no matter what I clicked on. I gave up. I just wanted to find an app where I could find my exercises and keep track as I did them, hopefully with video or images to ensure I was doing them right.",
            "Before using this app I couldnt drive or sit at all. I even struggled to use the toilet and tie my shoe laces. I spent most of my days laying flat or standing just to avoid the pain. Any bending or sitting position sent me into immediate and terrifyingly painful muscle spasms. Within 7 days of using this app I was recovering nicely without any more prescription meds. Within 6 weeks, my core was solid and I could start exercising, bending and every other normal activity.",
            "My literal only issue is that it doesnt have a \"both\" option on many pain areas, like knees. So I do 30 minutes on one side and reset it. When you start a plan, it gives you new exercises every day. You can go back and do old ones. Best PT, pain, gentle yoga app Ive used. Chronic Pain sufferer who cannot keep track of reps in sets is very pleased. Very sore, but not as bad as trying to do standard workouts. This is specific - functional exercises, not broadspectrum. Great for fibro/ddd/etc",
            "I was so excited about this app. I finally could do exercises for my specific issues. However the plan never works. My screen goes black right after the welcome video. I'm so disappointed.",

We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",
            "I think it's a great game you should download it it really help me right now I've finished day one and the wrist workout oh I help me alot cuz my right wrist use to make the crack sound when I spin it and now it totally fine. I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n⏰A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app’s mood diary.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "This app uses a pretty basic interface and lacks the flashy polish of other to-do list apps. However this is the only spoon energy management app available and does what it says on the tin. Users create activities or choose from presets, and assign spoon values to them. As users complete their to-do lists, the app subtracts the spoon values of each activity from the days' spoons as set by the user. The app also includes a mood tracker. The developer Rob is friendly and responsive.",
            "This app helps me plan and keep track of tasks I need to complete. I often need to manage my work life balance, and this app helps accommodate my goals. The design is concise and easy to use. I recommend using this app, especially if you want to maintain a balance and healthy lifestyle.",
            "I really like this app as a tool for spoonies to keep track of our energy spending. It helps plan my day ahead based on how I feel. I wish it would track mood and match spoons accordingly. Also a widget would be nice. But I highly recommend it.",
            "Well done on the most recent update: app much smoother & less glitchy :) Love the option to create activities that add spoons (such as self care). PLEASE look to develop a homescreen widget so the app needn't be launched to log spoon usage and so spoon counter is always available at a glance! Would love that.",
            "I loved this app when I first got it, but I have no access to settings, so all I can do is add and subtract activities. I just uninstalled and downloaded it again from the app store, and it looks exactly the same. Please tell me what happened!"

            "I was asked to keep a track of my intake of liquids and record when I go to the toilet by a health professional to see what is causing me issues. This app allows you to record when and what you drink and also if you leak and how urgent it is to need to go to the toilet. This app will be good to maintain and monitor that going forward.",
            "This app was able to help me see the potential health problems I was haven that went unnoticed before! After about 2 months of recording, I was able to visit my doctor with documentation when trying to explain my symptoms. Along with a food/exercise tracking app installed around the same time along with good record keeping, my doctor was able to pinpoint my exact cause of symptoms and was able to point me in the right direction for overall better personal health care!!!",
            "Exactly what I needed. Extremely simple. No ridiculous bells and whistles that only a physician would need. My only request would be an easier way to get back from the diary to an entry and reverse. A little old school to have to back out of one to get to the other. Great job. Please keep it simple guys ...too many over complicated over thought apps out there.",
            "Easy to record urine flow and liquid intake. Just enter the volume and your observations. Time of the activity is automatically recorded. Keeps a time wise diary which can be exported by pdf to a mail ID. It will help you and your doctor to monitor any issues. Very easy to use.",
            "Very effective and easy to use. I am not sure I would say I love using it to track all bladder movements, but if you need to do this, this is definitely the no-nonsense, easy-to-use tool to do it. Data export is easy and effective, allowing you the opportunity to throw real data back at your urologist. Oz to ml conversions on the fly, drink size presets, and ability to note characteristics for each entry are features I use. This app owns."

            "pro's and con's like most things.not much use to users outside the U.S but pretty good for American users.there are users on this app asking for money but then there are some genuine users who need and can give support.the app support is limited to be nice,a total joke to be honest.in my humble opinion i think this app is seriously flawed and the developers do not seem interested in fixing the problems.in general,id say the app is a great idea....but only if they make it work properly some day.",

            "I paid for this app for my daughter but she can only access a few of the free meditations. Most of them won't play despite paying for a monthly subscription. She sent a message to the company through the app but they have not responded.",
            "I use it with my life coaching clients and encourage them to use them when home as one strategy to help reframe. Working with a lot of attachment issues. The heartbreak and abandonment one is very effective.",
            "This is a fantastic app and very affordable. I couldn't afford a 10 or more dollar a month fee, but I can do 5. I think that's very reasonable and wonderful that they have an affordable option for those of us who need it. I had to go to the dentist and then the endodontist today of which I am very phobic. I listened to their Relieve Stress ( the second meditation and the affirmations) before, and during my appointments. They really helped me keep calm enough to get through. Thank you HJ!",
            "Oh boy, what a deal! I'm a therapist and have used imagery personally and professionally for years. I've recommended Health Journeys to more people than I can possibly count and it seldom disappoints. Imagine my delight when they created an app. I love having access to all the titles, anytime, anywhere! I've used imagery even more frequently these past 31/2 years, and daily in the last couple of months. Between our current unbelievable political environment and the COVOD19 pandemic, I seek safe respite and guidance daily from Belleruth, Emmett, Glenda, Carol, Tracy, Stephen, etc. Thank you to your amazing team. Keep up the good work--we need you now more than ever.",
            "I love this app. I began using it after I broke my wrist and required surgery. The mediation for successful surgery was incredibly helpful, as was the rapid recovery from injury. As well, I've tried many other of the meditations, for support with stress, menopause, relaxation, sleep, and resisting virus/COVID-19. I appreciate these resources so much. And the cost is about the same per month as I would pay for one yoga class! I love this app. I've been telling everyone I can about how useful it has been for me. Love it! Thank you!"

            "This app is an extraordinary tool. It still has some kinks to work out, but the team working on it is very helpful and dedicated to making geopain the best pain recording app it can be. I've personally had a few errors come up. I reported the errors through the app and had a personal response from a real person within a few hours. Even better, I've been kept with the same person through all of my messages so I have that familiarity. Eric, has been kind and attentive to my concerns and issues, he's even listened intently to my suggestions for the app, including asking me deeper questions about how I thought it would work if changed and what situations I would use the changes in. If you're having issues, reach out through the speech bubble in the top right corner of the app. This company cares about the people in pain who can benefit from geopain. They will treat you with respect and help get things going again. I give it 4 stars because, as it is a new app, it still has places to improve. I know this will be a 5 star app when it's kinks have been worked out!",
            "I've only just started using the app after seeing an article on The Mighty but it certainly looks promising. A way of being able to show exactly where my pain is is the one thing the app I've been using for the last couple of years is missing. I don't think I'll stop using FibroMapp as I like the variety of ways data can be displayed, but I think that GeoPain will be a really useful way of showing my doctors where I'm in pain and how intense that pain is.",
            "This app would be perfect if it had an offline mode, with an option to sync entries to whatever entity is storing them already, like several other health apps I use. Turning wifi on slows my phone down immensely and drains the battery, so I don't like to do it unless I really need to. I'd probably do several entries a day if I could just open the app and do them and not have to turn wifi on and then login.",
            "This app is a wonderful tool to help you and your Drs communicate when your not at the Drs office. The reports you can create and print out or email are wonderful so your Drs can see what has been going on between appointments. I have shown my pain Dr this app and he thinks this is a wonderful app, the best he's seen so far to record and report pain. Thank you GeoPain!!",
            "creating your first pain record is simple to do. follow the pop up prompts when selecting your areas of pain is simple to do. selecting the sext steps is easy to follow as well. the easy to use interface is great for everyone needing this app to record their pain. creating reports and sending them require a little thought, but easy to work through routine will have you reporting to your doctor in no time. I look forward to future editions with more helpful functions for the patient and doctor."

I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",
            "This app is easy to use and very accurate. But please make a weight GAIN version. People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to. But gaining weight is not only harder than losing it, it's also WAY harder to find help with it.",

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

We are all unique individuals. You already know that remedies that work for others may not necessarily work for you. Whether they are supplements you are consuming, habits you are doing or routines that you are enforcing, this tracker helps you discover what is actually working for you…and what isn't.\r\n\r\nLearn yourself. Take action. 💪\r\n\r\nMany times, you might have imagined the wonderful life without the symptoms that have been bothering you for the past decade or so. You might have the following things you want to get rid of once and for all:\r\n\r\n• General symptoms: fatigue, stress, bad mood, high blood pressure, pain \r\n• Sleep: snoring, low quality sleep, not enough sleep\r\n• Gut Health: bloating, indigestion, acid reflux\r\n• Allergies or intolerances: food intolerances, dust allergy, hay fever\r\n• Mood disorders: stress, anxiety, migraine, headache\r\n\r\nYou never really knew whether the products you tried actually worked or not. Not surprisingly, you might end up with a cabinet full of pills and supplements, and your symptoms live on. It is time to save yourself time and money. Learn yourself with this symptom diary/symptom tracker.\r\n\r\nAre you a good fit for this app?🤷‍♀️ \r\nIf you are ready to take action, this app will be meaningful for you. This is not a habit tracker or a pill scheduler. You are beyond apps like those. If want to take charge of your wellbeing & longevity, this app will be your trusty assistant. \r\n\r\n🔥 Features 🔥\r\nTodo-list style: Simple and easy. Did something? Give it a check. If you didn't? Leave it blank. Think about how easy it is to log your item. No-fuss at all.\r\nPretty Bar Graphs: What's the point of all the numbers when you can't visualize them. We got you covered. We show you how the remedies influence you positively or negatively through an intuitive visualization. \r\nCompare up to 3 Remedies/Items: See which supplement, habit or routine helps you the most and which ones aren't. Put up to 3 of them side-by-side and you can easily visualize their effectiveness at a glance.\r\nEdit/Backfill Entries: Feel free to create entries for previous days or edit previous entries up to 28 days past.\r\nExport your data: Your data belongs to you. Export your data as a CSV file when you want to do intense data crunching or just to save it somewhere else. \r\nIntegration: Have an Oura Ring? Connect them to the app to pull your sleep data for analysis.\r\nReminder: For busy people. \r\n\r\nHow to Use?🤷‍♂️\r\nThink of things you suspect are causing problems or things that might help you become healthier or better (e.g. supplements, medications, activities...).\r\nExamples of self-experiments you can try:\r\n1. Does restricting coffee intake help me sleep better?\r\n2. Does this mood supplement actually help me with my mood disorder/mental health?\r\n3. Does taking my pre-workout help me perform better in the gym?\r\n4. What food is causing me to have bloating/indigestion?\r\n\r\n🛌 More On Sleep 😴\r\nSleep is underrated. Many of us are not prioritizing sleep enough. This app gives you the power to optimize your sleep. Use the sleep data from the sleep tracker of your choice and experiment with different bedtime routines. Make changes and log them to see what is helping you and what isn't. Connect your Oura Ring if you have one.\r\n\r\nWho knows? You might find that using a cheap and simple eye mask can drastically improve the quality of your sleep? This health journal is going to help you find out what truly works for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Pattern, a health & life journal, is just one of the many medical apps in the store.

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

The exercises are simple to learn and enjoyable to practice, and you can easily follow along with Dr. Yang's demonstration. The movements can be practiced sitting or standing. \r\nIn the second half of the program, Dr. Yang offers pain-relieving massage techniques for yourself and with a partner, and shows important pressure points, or acupuncture cavities.

Massage is sometimes necessary to help improve your circulation to speed the healing process.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to prevent Back Pain or are suffering from joint pain already, qigong can help you with pain relief and stimulate your healing. For centuries, the Chinese have healed and strengthened their bodies with Qigong (chee-kung), the art of using the mind to direct the energy within your body to improve health and vitality. This program also gives an introduction to the general concepts of qigong and how it pertains to Back Pain.\r\n\"Qigong for Back Pain Relief\" by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is also available as a DVD, book or ebook. \r\n\r\nLearn details about posture, the Qi (energy) circulatory system, and how to properly practice Qigong to improve your health. \r\nThe flow of Qi (energy) can be disturbed either through external trauma, such as an injury, or internal trauma such as depression or stress, or even just a sedentary lifestyle. When the body is energetically out of balance, this is when symptoms like aches and pain start to occur and we start to experience a state of \"disease\". Wherever you feel pain or tightness, your energetic circulation is stagnant, or even blocked. Stagnation is the root of injury or illness. Qigong meditation can increase the quantity of your Qi (energy) and improve the quality of your circulation.\r\nQi-gong translates from Chinese to Energy-Work. Qigong meditation creates balance in the body, both physically and energetically, by improving the flow of energy that circulates through the body in the meridians. We all have a \"life force\", Qi (energy) within all our trillions of cells, allowing them to function. Qi also regulates physical, emotional, mental and spiritual stability.

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

Knee pain can prevent you from participating in your favorite activities and performing daily tasks.

Strong muscles in the legs can help provide support for the knees. This support may alleviate pressure and strain on these joints, which can relieve pain and help a person be more active.\r\n\r\nGentle stretching and strengthening exercises can strengthen the muscles that support your knee joint. Having stronger muscles can reduce the impact and stress on your knee, and help your knee joint move more easily.\r\n\r\nWhy exercise is vital?\r\n\r\nExercise can help you improve your health and fitness without hurting your joints.

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Having tried this app out by recording last month's symptoms and calling up the chart, I couldn't export it even though I have a Google address. Then I found that one of the symptoms appeared on today's date, when I haven't had it today. There was no way I could remove this symptom from today without deleting the actual symptom from the database! Such a lovely idea for an app if it worked properly. And there are no instructions.",
            "The app ws working great for a few months. I was tracking everything in readiness for an important doctors appointment next week. Woke up this morning to find all my tracking has gone! And there is no way that I can see to bring it back! Months of tracking gone. Now this is going to make a huge impact on my upcoming appointment.",
            "Can't export data because I can't add an email. Can't fix this because the email address provided on Google Play Store is no longer valid. Very, very disappointed and sad. This app is incredible but without being able to export data, it's 100% useless.",
            "very simple and easy to use for recording symptoms. the reporting leaves something to be desired. I'd like to be able to select one symptoms and then see how all the factors compare for that one symptom instead of selecting then one at a time.",
            "Excellent. Simple, customizable and for the data junky: exportable. I use it to track any environmental variable, moods, sleep, excercise, water etc and of course every outcome: vigor, acuity and the negative of course headaches, etc etc. Along with myfitnesspal it's the only health ap I need."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Not a bad app, a little clunky to do some things but it works. There are 2 things that would improve the app for me. 1. Allow the app to work in landscape mode so the graph is easier to check. 2. Make it so you can zoom on the graphs, especially for heart rate. Even using a stylus it is very difficult to select individual readings let alone read the tiny text.",
            "Overall the watch is fairly decent. very difficult accessing & reading text messaging or mail message on watch. if you don't like to wear the watch tight on wrist, the pulse oxygen meter may be slightly off. Heart monitor blood pressure reads backwards. You can't customize the home screen, except for their 4 uploaded pictures, can't add your own. Wrist response is not very good. If you shake your wrist hard , it never wakes, no adjustable sensitivity meter. Sleep on app only. App runs always.",
            "Installed to go with a fitness tracking watch. The basic function of tracking steps works ok. More advanced functions like other activity tracking seem to work well with heart rate tracked over time. Blood pressure testing seems to be unreliable to the point where it's not usable. Weight tracking doesn't exist, you just enter your weight into the personal details but it doesn't track it over time. If you then change your weight, it keeps syncing your old weight to Google Fit making tracking your weight in google fit directly harder as it keeps getting events added with the wrong weight - there seems no way to turn this off. I'll probably keep trying with this for a bit longer but it would be helpful if I could choose which things were synced with Google Fit.",
            "Reading through the other complaints about watch/phone connection, I had that problem with a Fitbit versa and a Moto 5. I switched to a Arbily ID205 and this app and have had no problems. It doesn't have all the functionality of the Fitbit but it works reliably. It provides basic functions and clear easy user interface. Apps are limited to the functionality of a watch and its ability to connect with a phone.",
            "Never really had a problem with the app until recently. Within the last few days, the app has stopped showing me the heart rate zone details. I can see the graph, but the bars underneath don't register the exercise done. I checked back a few weeks, and it is the bars don't work there either."

And an option to turn off the subtitles on downloaded videos. Also, I can't find a way to turn off the autoplay on the monthly playlists. The transition was really messy for Android users but I think with some time and patience this can work better. 7/16/20 App had an update and many good features have been added, like a customizable calendar. It runs smoother.",
            "Absolutely adore Adriene and her programs, but the new app is particular glitchy on Android. I usually have to open it multiple times before it works, even then find it to be quite glitchy (tapping on links does nothing, search function doesnt work).",

        "description": "How to Relieve Back Pain\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps you bent the wrong way while lifting something heavy. Or you're dealing with a degenerative condition like arthritis. Whatever the cause, once you have low back pain, it can be hard to shake. About one in four Americans say they've had a recent bout of low back pain. And almost everyone can expect to experience back pain at some point in their lives.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it’s clearly serious: You were injured, or you feel numbness, weakness, or tingling in the legs. Call the doctor, of course. But for routine and mild low back pain, here are a few simple tips to try at home.\r\n\r\nChill it. Ice is best in the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury because it reduces inflammation.\r\n\r\nKeep moving. Our spines are like the rest of our body -- they're meant to move. Keep doing your daily activities. Make the beds, go to work, walk the dog. Once you're feeling better, regular aerobic exercises like swimming, bicycling, and walking can keep you -- and your back -- more mobile. Just don't overdo it. There's no need to run a marathon when your back is sore.\r\n\r\nStay strong. Once your low back pain has receded, you can help avert future episodes of back pain by working the muscles that support your lower back, including the back extensor muscles. Having strong hip, pelvic, and abdominal muscles also gives you more back support. Avoid abdominal crunches, because they can actually put more strain on your back.\r\n\r\nWays to Manage Low Back Pain at Home\r\n\r\nSleep Better: When you have back pain, sleeping can be hard. It can be a vicious cycle because when you don't get enough sleep, your back pain may feel worse. A poor sleep position can also aggravate back pain. \r\n\r\nGood Posture: Grandma was right! Slouching is bad for you. And poor posture can make back pain worse, especially if you sit for long periods. \r\n\r\nPhysical Therapy\r\nPhysical therapists can teach you how to sit, stand, and move in a way that keeps your spine in proper alignment and alleviates strain on your back.\r\n\r\n✅ back pain relief\r\n✅ lower back pain relief\r\n✅ sciatica relief\r\n✅ sciatic nerve relief",

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "Ever since the update this app sucks outloud. The dashboard in the widget is useless, nothing shows up there. Things that were there before the update are gone. I have to check the calendar at best to find tasks, at worst I have to refer to the email I was sent. Making the app effectively useless. I can just use a calendar app. That way I can see the info i need at a glance without having to dig for it. UPDATE. I don't see ANY of my projects at all in the app. Just deleted the app. Thanks!!",

There is no option to enter in your password and email combination. Since my email accounts are both Gmail I'd be obliged to logout and login back in each time or create a new account and lose my work. Is it really asking too ...",

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",

Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

I wish this app would auto save your work so if you close the app you can continue later. I lost so much work 😓 cuz I'm a dummie and closed the tab...",

A floating widget were i can press a button to see my memos, a button to hit for making diaries, and another for tasks and entries. Please add an awesome widget to expand this awesome app. Then ill re rate 5 stars",

I've have used a few other notepads and journal apps but they all seemed to have something missing... and then I found this Gem! Or maybe it found me so-to-speak... Ive always been attracted to the Darker Side of things, and it always intrigues me to dive a little deeper... And now i have one more item to add to the collection, it has a great look and easy to use and navigate thru and the dark Theme makes it even SEXIER!!",
            "I saw a lot of BUG, 1. bug when updating a photo in note, photo didn't update and make app stuck for some times 2. Please add feature undo and redo like Ms word Because I lost my special note and dont know why, and im so disappointed i need to do analysis again to make that note. For now just that, over all its good, the bad i found for now just what im write. Thanks for your service and respond. Alex",

            "I was quite happy with this app until my phone did a system upadate then all my recorded data went bye bye. And since I have no sdcard and you can't specify an email address I tried but could not create a backup or export file. So while I love what it does not having export or backup capability is a show stopper for me. Perhaps the reason the data got wiped with the update is the location of the storage for the app - which I could not find with my file manager.",
            "Great app but needs update. New phone with newer Android. Cannot exit from screens without killing app. Best I've found that records bp/glucose/pulse - just needed comment field.",
            "I like this app because my glucose and blood pressure doesn't vary much. the only negative is, I can't enter a time. I'm rushing out to work and I don't get to enter my blood sugar until after I'm on my lunch break. I'd like to know that that reading was a fasting reading.",
            "Finally, finally, finally a health diary that does everything. Blood pressure, temperature, glucose, weight, etc. Not only that, but it is a very easy interface to use, totally uncluttered! And it has backup and restore"

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

The exercises are simple to learn and enjoyable to practice, and you can easily follow along with Dr. Yang's demonstration. The movements can be practiced sitting or standing. \r\nIn the second half of the program, Dr. Yang offers pain-relieving massage techniques for yourself and with a partner, and shows important pressure points, or acupuncture cavities.

For centuries, the Chinese have healed and strengthened their bodies with Qigong (chee-kung), the art of using the mind to direct the energy within your body to improve health and vitality. This program also gives an introduction to the general concepts of qigong and how it pertains to arthritis.\r\n\"Qigong for Arthritis Relief\" by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is also available as a DVD, book or ebook. \r\n\r\nLearn details about posture, the Qi (energy) circulatory system, and how to properly practice Qigong to improve your health. \r\nThe flow of Qi (energy) can be disturbed either through external trauma, such as an injury, or internal trauma such as depression or stress, or even just a sedentary lifestyle. When the body is energetically out of balance, this is when symptoms like aches and pain start to occur and we start to experience a state of \"disease\". Wherever you feel pain or tightness, your energetic circulation is stagnant, or even blocked. Stagnation is the root of injury or illness. Qigong meditation can increase the quantity of your Qi (energy) and improve the quality of your circulation.\r\nQi-gong translates from Chinese to Energy-Work. Qigong meditation creates balance in the body, both physically and energetically, by improving the flow of energy that circulates through the body in the meridians.

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "The app is good, I can communicate with other fans and my idols but the main problem is notifications 😶I don't know when my idol post something or comment on someone's post. Normally everyone gets notifications but I don't at all. Secondly the translation; it's very bad. It misinterprets what people post a lot like all the time. So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand 😐 cause of the translator. Please fix these issues 🙂",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

            "If you've lived with endo for any length of time, you know everything this app drip-feeds you over 12 weeks. List of doctors is US-only, the \"coach\" only contacted me about 3 times, and if you do any yoga at all the exercises will be laughable. An extra star as the symptom tracker, while imperfect, is pretty comprehensive and useful. Not worth spending money on though, and the \"articles\" treat you like a child.",
            "wonderful broad and comprehensive information and advice in how to live your best life with endometriosis",
            "I started looking for symptom tracking apps to prep for my appointment with a specialist next month. I found this app and after reaching out to see if I could test the app, I'm very impressed with the responsiveness of the team and the passion behind this product. I've signed in and started on my \"day 1\" tasks and it is very simple to understand and navigate. It's a comprehensive education and tracking tool to help improve my health and communicate with my doctor. I'm really excited for this!!!"

        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different. Plunge into a whole series of adventures, going down into the city subway, traveling to the mountains and national parks on the edge of the city, and venturing through the wasteland, all while shooting your way through hordes of the walking dead.\r\n\r\nRPG AND SURVIVAL\r\nPrey Day is one of the most dangerous zombie survival games full of players who may have different goals and methods of survival - run, shoot, defend, team up, target, and fight real players fighting for survival just like you. Shooting games challenge your skill, speed, and reaction time, and when you're fighting for survival, you'll do everything you can not to die. With both co op and PVP elements, you can communicate and unite with friends, or oppose and kill competitors - the best traditions of MMO and online multiplayer games!",

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "Seems to be doing a satisfactory amount of useful things. I don't rate 5 stars, nothing's perfect and I haven't had it but a short amount of time. So.... rates are rates. That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"

All the sudden, without warning, my history is limited and I'm supposed to pay a premium to access my data that was already there? Shameful..don't let greed get to your head. You'll lose customers. Sure hope this gets enough attention from the community.",
            "They introduced a premium subscription plan. This was not part of the deal. Deal was buy the fing box and you get all the software and features that come with it. Now they are finding ways to nickel and dime us and to keep us as paying customers. Every company does this. Offer an idea, back them up, you pay for the device and then the company now has millions of people with their device in their house. Then comes the hidden repeat business plan. Hate companies like this.",
            "This app used to be clean and simple, but now it gets more and more cluttered with each update. I used to use it exclusively, but now its so cluttered with \"features\" that it is almost impossible to find the features you need. It's so sad when a good app gets ruined like this, more features does not make an app better!!! It can if it's carefully designed but fing has totally failed in that regard. I have decided to move on and I am now using a different app that's more like Fing used to be.",
            "I've been using the fing app for a long time now and I really love it. I liked it so much that I bought a fingbox when they were still looking for funding on indiegogo. After updating the app today, I am disgusted to see that the developers have the audacity to offer \"premium\" features for a subscription. This action leaves a bitter taste in my mouth as this is how the developers treat the very people who enabled them to bring the fingbox to the market.",
            "Since Google doesn't provide enough characters for a thorough review of Fing, I'll just WARN anyone considering this app to look elsewhere. If history is any indication of what can be expected, then you need to know that paying a monthly subscription fee won't be any assurance that you'll get what you're paying for very long. And if competent Tech Support is important to you, then you definitely need to look elsewhere, because if you have a legitimate issue they can't fix, you will be ignored!"

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."
