Registry is a collection of patient-reported data from people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS) and healthy controls. People with ME/CFS know this disease best and have invaluable information to share based on their lived experience. You + M.E. gives patients a platform to share their share what they know about their disease with researchers.

They also use the You + M.E. mobile app to record symptoms, activity, and other factors related to their disease over time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou + M.E. mobile app users are asked to consistently report on a core set of symptoms: fatigue, brain fog, unrefreshing sleep, lightheadedness, and post-exertional malaise (PEM). Beyond the 5 core symptoms, people can self-select symptoms relevant to them for tracking in the app. There are additional screens for logging life events (e.g. socializing with family/friends), activity levels, and an overall rating of wellness. Graphing functionality within the app provides trends in easy to read, comprehensive charts that users can use to monitor their health and share with loved ones or healthcare team.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n\r\n- Sign up for the You + M.E.

Honestly I have so many treatments and symptoms that to remake this list every single day is extremely cumbersome. Therefore I no longer can use this app.",

I wanted to relate this to triggers causing pain and also to actions/Meds to reduce pain. This app did not seem to do that or had such a lack of intuitive design that it was all but useless. Changed to Manage My Pain app and found 100% better or more what I needed. Not really sure what this app is intended for.....",

I have a serious issue with one of your users harrassing/bulling me. I would love for her to leave the app or just at least not be able to find me.",
            "I like it so far. I do wish we could choose which of our diagnoses end up on our feed. My feed is swamped with depression posts, but I really just joined for support with PTSD. I still have depression, so I don't necessarily want to remove it from diagnoses, but I think I'll have to just so I can get the information I actually need.",
            "This app is overrun with spam, fake accounts, and people trying to scam others. There's also a number of people who are rude and abusive even though it's supposed to be a support app. Reporting people does nothing because the people are never removed even if several people report them several times each. And if someone harasses you in a DM there's no way to report it.",
            "very excited for this app to develop more with interface problems, everything else is perfect. i can't find a way to follow or even open people's community pages, so i'm pretty sure it's a glitch. hope it gets fixed ASAP as it really makes the app less useful.",
            "Whenever I try to create an account, everything goes fine until I have to upload a profile picture. Everytime I do, the app crashes and I have to start all over."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

I had an issue recently with not being able to log in, I emailed the support and they fixed it within 48 hours. Highly recommended.",
            "Easy to use, pleasant color scheme settings, wide variety of symptoms to track, but if it doesn't stop pinging me EVERY TWO MINUTES TO TRACK THE SYMPTOMS I ALREADY TRACKED, I'm going to throw it out a window. ETA: I've now uninstalled the program and reduced its rating. I got logged out somehow and it refuses to reset my password. I just can't with this app anymore. Support takes weeks to get back to you and if it won't even let me sign in then it's literally unusable.",
            "This app is such an empowering tool to get to know what my cycles entail and to have the ability to predict what days I may need to give myself extra love and support. I love having so many options of experiences that can be tracked. I also live with bipolar type 2 and it's been beneficial to see patterns there too. Having the 'overall' rating has helped me to remember that even when there's difficult parts to my day there may have been some good parts too.",
            "Excellent app for tracking your symptoms. Easy to use, great lay out and gives you an excellent visual of your month as it has charts for each symptom. My app was glitching and I contacted customer support, they responded quickly, solved the problem and were very kind and helpful in their communication with me. Definitely rate this 5 stars!!",
            "Oct 24: I heard back from support and am able to access my data again, nothing was lost. Was glad to hear back quickly. Oct 21: Worked for one day before logging me out and removing my account. I would have really liked it, as the trends for each are displayed on a graph to see the impact over time."

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

            "This is full of amazing ideas to help with persistent pain, broken into bite size pieces that you can try. Some seem more appropriate than others but this will obviously vary from person to person. A mix of physical and mental emotional suggestions, and they don't take a lot of time. Little and often is what's needed so even on a busy day you can do something to help.",
            "Excellent for chronic pain sufferers. It has helped me to rewire my brain to deal with a severe back injury which I'm now at the tail end of. However this app is more than dealing with pain. It's about neuroplasticity which is now helping me eliminate vertigo and tinnitus. Definitely worth the subscription as they are constantly updating content.",
            "I love this app. I learned so much about pain and I feel understood in my issues. Thank you soo much",
            "I have sciatica symptoms related to a bulging disc that have continued for a year. I have already found benefit in reduced pain symptoms after a few days. I am really shocked, in a good way. I am normally reluctant to pay for an app but compared to the thousands spent on gp, physio, chiro, pain medication, this is really not much. It has given me back some hope that my quality of life will improve which is priceless. I'll update the review after a few weeks, maybe even pain free!",
            "WOW the whole app changed since I been thinking of doing it. Is there no more old sessions? What happened to the old sessions? I know I tested the old 10 free sessions & loved them, but was not ready to use the app & now everything change. As well as why can't your app be moved to the sd card? It takes too much space on the internal space when you are low on space. The app keeps crashing because my phone is low on space as there is no way to move it to the SD card."

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

Then I found that one of the symptoms appeared on today's date, when I haven't had it today. There was no way I could remove this symptom from today without deleting the actual symptom from the database! Such a lovely idea for an app if it worked properly. And there are no instructions.",
            "The app ws working great for a few months. I was tracking everything in readiness for an important doctors appointment next week. Woke up this morning to find all my tracking has gone! And there is no way that I can see to bring it back! Months of tracking gone. Now this is going to make a huge impact on my upcoming appointment.",
            "Can't export data because I can't add an email. Can't fix this because the email address provided on Google Play Store is no longer valid. Very, very disappointed and sad. This app is incredible but without being able to export data, it's 100% useless.",
            "very simple and easy to use for recording symptoms. the reporting leaves something to be desired. I'd like to be able to select one symptoms and then see how all the factors compare for that one symptom instead of selecting then one at a time.",
            "Excellent. Simple, customizable and for the data junky: exportable. I use it to track any environmental variable, moods, sleep, excercise, water etc and of course every outcome: vigor, acuity and the negative of course headaches, etc etc. Along with myfitnesspal it's the only health ap I need."

I dont recommend this app because it could lead users to cause more pain or discomfort for themselves if they dont carefully research anything found within the app. This is not a reputable source."

Also, probably should differentiate between cancer symptoms and medication side effects. There is no way to input side effects in the past. When I am feeling sick, the last thing I want to do is mess with the phone. For heavy reactions, input is going to be retroactive, so good to support that I think."

        "description": "Clear your mind from anxiety and stress, leaving you free to enjoy a healthier life!\r\n\r\nThe app was developed based on 20 years of tried and tested behavioural change work in private practice helping many people with a unique method. Interrupting the connection between your negative emotional memories and your brain, clearing your mind and leaving you feeling much better. \r\n\r\nUsing advanced eye tracking technology, this unique method is now brought right to your mobile device.\r\n\r\nYour brain is being triggered by emotional memories hidden inside your mind, that’s why your problem has been so difficult to diagnose, because it‘s real, you haven’t made it up. Your mind holds the key to why you have too much or too little cortisol or adrenaline leading to massive social anxiety, panic attacks, stress and burnout and even chronic pain, but they are all symptoms of past emotional experiences. \r\n\r\nYou may have the time on your hands to master meditation, mindfulness or another healing therapy, which is great. The benefits of meditation are now scientifically proven to be beneficial to your body and mind. You could spend hours practicing DIY meditation at home or simply allow MindReset to accelerate the process for you in minutes.\r\n\r\nFear driven problems associated with anxiety and stress are listed below:\r\n\r\nHyperarousal \r\n•\tangry outbursts\r\n•\tirritability\r\n•\tsleeping problems (insomnia)\r\n•\tdifficulty concentrating\r\n•\tTired yet wired\r\n•\tAdrenal Fatigue\r\n•\tother mental health problems – such as depression, anxiety or phobias, \r\n•\tSelf-harming or destructive behaviour – such as drug or alcohol misuse \r\n•\tother physical symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness, chest and other pains and stomach-ache \r\n•\tPTSD, Trauma, Emotional Memory Images, sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.\r\n•\tM.E. ratio 3 women to 1 man\r\n•\tAbdominal pain, cramping or Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS\r\n•\tA bloated feeling\r\n•\tGas\r\n•\tDiarrhoea or constipation — sometimes alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhoea\r\n•\tLevel of depression\r\n\r\nHyporarousal\r\n\r\n•\tYou feel distant and disconnected from your body\r\n•\t Emotional and or Physical Numbness\r\n•\tBlank Mind\r\n•\tProfound detachment can’t get into or hold onto a relationship or job\r\n•\t Inability to move or respond\r\n•\tExtreme drowsiness and even temporary loss of consciousness\r\n\r\nYour fear response is the cause of your problems.

I loved being able to track symptoms with time frames, notes, dates and how severe the symptoms were. Perfect for my upcoming Dr. Appointment. I loved how I was able to add which days I took medicine as well. But now I'm unable to use it and have to uninstall because of the constant crashing.",

My only suggestion would be for the time frame ( morning, afternoon, evening) to be able to include more than one time frame ( ie: morning and afternoon) or to have an \"all day\" option My symptoms often last 12 or more hours.",

Meg Matthews has made the menopause a much more talked about subject and providing excellent professionals, wisdom and products. The tracker is the latest tab - simple idea but brilliant. However I'm feeling, MM is my go to forum. I love this app. Thank you Meg",
            "A fantastic app makes you feel that you are not going through this alone, full of information that you wouldn't necessarily be aware of and the symptom tracker is an added bonus to help you keep an eye on all of the changes you are experiencing.Brilliant, well done couldn't be without it.",
            "Life saving app for women 💞 Meg's app is an excellent tool which can be used on a daily basis to access up-to-date information in relation to peri and menopausal symptoms. It enables women to chat freely and safely about issues surrounding menopause ,including hrt,alternatives and products that are useful. The app makes you feel you are not alone and provides the much needed support that isn't available in the UK. Couldn't have got help without this app and for me it was a life saver .",

She talked to me on this huge monitor from another room. I felt like I was on an IMAX screen. We are already big but we were huge on that screen! We were so disappointed at that whole visit. I could have just stayed home. I won't go back there anymore. I love my care plan app and I will stick to what works for me. Thank you My Care Plan.",

            "This app has changed the game for me when it comes to going to the pharmacy. Whenever my girlfriend sick (or myself) I just put in the symptoms and it gives me medicine that will help with every symptom I have. I'm no longer having to buy five different medicines at the same time. Not only that it gives me the location where this medicine might be my local pharmacy. And the prices so I can go get the cheapest one. It also has Amazon prices in case I want to buy a lot at once if I need to use the medicine frequently. And unlike WebMD or something like that it doesn't make me feel like I have some rare disease, it gives me something country I can work with that actually helps solve my problem instead of worrying about it. 10/10 would recommend.",

            "Started using the app this week. It was straight up easy to use, and super easy to add an entry when needed (which I am like every few hours) so it's not a chore to use. The layout is simple and clear, making it easy to track what's going on. Only two things I would change: 1) The massive cartoon image that's always there on the home screen. Purely because it's unnecessary and I just don't like it. 2) The fact you can't delete preprogrammed logs, but apparently in the next update that will change",
            "Very useful, but some limitations... I like the flexibility of the categories and options--lots of ways to fine-tune the information you record. I'd *really* like records to be editable, though... it's annoying not to be able to correct or amend a symptom record, for example--you just simply have to delete it and start all over again. Also, if I try to enter notes with voice-to-text, it won't take the resulting text... just leaves it blank. I'd like more charting options, but that's just picky.",
            "Just started using it but love it! Its easy to use, you can customize it, you can track different aslects of your symptoms by graph (which will be handy when the doctor asks, \"How ofyen does this happen?\"), and you can write notes to further explain things if need be. This is just what I was looking for!",
            "So far, exactly what I was looking for! Just wanted something to track symptoms from my autoimmune disease when i get them. This is so easy to use. And so easy to add new symptoms. And sub categories for those. The recently used feature is great. And took me 1 seconds to figire this app out and has all the features i was hoping for. Ive only had it an hour..but so, far its perfect!",
            "I like the app and use it to track a variety of things. There are a lot of little things that should be improved. It frequently fails to open. A phone reboot is required then all is well. There is a prepopulated list of meds and foods, you can add anything you want but you cant fix them once you use them and you cant shorten the list by getting rid of preloaded ones you dont need. Trends fails to put in datapoints for zero occurances."

I do hope to see some updates, maybe icon choices between breakfast, lunch and dinner to better distinguish between the three instead of the same icon. Maybe a choice of colors. A little bit would go a long way to making this app great.",
            "A simple app for logging meals, with a pleasing design. But there should be a way to set the time to 12H instead of 24H. For instance my entry may say 2:15 PM, but when viewing the diary feed it's listed as 14:15. There are no settings or preferences. Also agree with another reviewer that a calendar view for jumping to specific days would be nice.",
            "The free version only gives you a 7 day history. I'm in the middle of unpleasant intolerance symptoms so seeing my logs is imperative and my health depends on it. I don't want to bounce between a lot of apps or reenter info across them. Please consider another barrier, even ads. If I remember this app I might consider trying it when I'm not feeling sick, but this app is designed for sick people, so... It's a bummer because the interface is nice and you can't go wrong with googly eyes.",
            "I downloaded it for the symptoms too, but there isnt a calendar view, and it only records 7 days before asking for a lot of money. I had to uninstall.",
            "I use this to track my baby's symptoms as I am still breastfeeding and it works really well. I can add and edit things that I forgot and it's nice to have a scale of how bad the symptoms were for each event. The only thing I would love to see to improve it would be some sort of graph or chart as part of the report showing any patterns instead of having to read back through all of my entries to see if I can find any links."

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

            "Started using the app this week. It was straight up easy to use, and super easy to add an entry when needed (which I am like every few hours) so it's not a chore to use. The layout is simple and clear, making it easy to track what's going on. Only two things I would change: 1) The massive cartoon image that's always there on the home screen. Purely because it's unnecessary and I just don't like it. 2) The fact you can't delete preprogrammed logs, but apparently in the next update that will change",
            "Very useful, but some limitations... I like the flexibility of the categories and options--lots of ways to fine-tune the information you record. I'd *really* like records to be editable, though... it's annoying not to be able to correct or amend a symptom record, for example--you just simply have to delete it and start all over again. Also, if I try to enter notes with voice-to-text, it won't take the resulting text... just leaves it blank. I'd like more charting options, but that's just picky.",
            "Just started using it but love it! Its easy to use, you can customize it, you can track different aslects of your symptoms by graph (which will be handy when the doctor asks, \"How ofyen does this happen?\"), and you can write notes to further explain things if need be. This is just what I was looking for!",
            "So far, exactly what I was looking for! Just wanted something to track symptoms from my autoimmune disease when i get them. This is so easy to use. And so easy to add new symptoms. And sub categories for those. The recently used feature is great. And took me 1 seconds to figire this app out and has all the features i was hoping for. Ive only had it an hour..but so, far its perfect!",
            "I like the app and use it to track a variety of things. There are a lot of little things that should be improved. It frequently fails to open. A phone reboot is required then all is well. There is a prepopulated list of meds and foods, you can add anything you want but you cant fix them once you use them and you cant shorten the list by getting rid of preloaded ones you dont need. Trends fails to put in datapoints for zero occurances."

I do hope to see some updates, maybe icon choices between breakfast, lunch and dinner to better distinguish between the three instead of the same icon. Maybe a choice of colors. A little bit would go a long way to making this app great.",

For instance my entry may say 2:15 PM, but when viewing the diary feed it's listed as 14:15. There are no settings or preferences. Also agree with another reviewer that a calendar view for jumping to specific days would be nice.",

I don't want to bounce between a lot of apps or reenter info across them. Please consider another barrier, even ads. If I remember this app I might consider trying it when I'm not feeling sick, but this app is designed for sick people, so... It's a bummer because the interface is nice and you can't go wrong with googly eyes.",

I can add and edit things that I forgot and it's nice to have a scale of how bad the symptoms were for each event.

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

When you understand what makes your pain worse, you can begin to work on ways to reduce or deal with your pain “triggers.”\r\n\r\nThe more you know about how your body reacts, the more you can be in control. And being in better control can help you be less afraid and better able to manage your pain. \r\n\r\nThis app makes it easy to track your pain & symptoms and report to your doctors. Use our pain diary to keep track of your pain over time and share it with your doctor at your next appointment. Track a variety of pain elements, including location, pain duration, triggers and more.\r\n\r\nA pain diary is used to monitor levels of pain over a long period of time and collect data on possible triggers for that pain. One solution pain doctors recommend is keeping a pain diary, a consistent record of your pain experience.\r\n\r\nYour doctor will be looking for triggers, stresses, and patterns. The more detailed you can be about the factors that seem to influence your pain, the better. An accurate record of your pain will help your doctor give you the best treatment.\r\n\r\nWhy a Pain Journal Works for Chronic Pain\r\nThis information is useful both for you and your doctor. It can be used to help identify patterns of pain, such as time of day or level of stress, or pain triggers from certain activities. A pain journal can also show what doesn’t increase your pain, which can help you make better decisions about how you spend your day. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you log in a pain journal? Everybody uses their journal differently, but in this app you can do the following:\r\n- Give your pain a scale rating. We use the pain scale with the 0-10 rating system, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Your pain will usually fall somewhere in between.\r\n- Use pain descriptor words. Using pain descriptor words in your journal can help you track changes and patterns in your pain quality. It can also help doctors pinpoint your type of pain.\r\n- Track the time of day pain occurs. \r\n- Note what you are doing when your pain begins. \r\n- Look at elements that might contribute to your pain.\r\n- Write down what you ate and drank that day.\r\n- Describe your mood",

Your pain will usually fall somewhere in between.<br>- Use pain descriptor words. Using pain descriptor words in your journal can help you track changes and patterns in your pain quality. It can also help doctors pinpoint your type of pain.<br>- Track the time of day pain occurs. <br>- Note what you are doing when your pain begins. <br>- Look at elements that might contribute to your pain.<br>- Write down what you ate and drank that day.<br>- Describe your mood",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I love this app it tells me what day i should start and I've done that each time. My only issue was this last period lasted 13 days and i had to restart my period twice even tho I hadn't selected that my period had ended yet, there should be a way to fix that so you don't have to restart and make notes. My other thing was when you say you've been intimate you have 3 positions to choose from but it only let's you choose one, could you please fix that also? Other than that I've been very satisfied",
            "Overall has been a hugely helpful app. My one beef is if I'm trying to remove the pregnancy setting and accidentally choose \"miscarriage\" as the reason I can't go back and fix it. There is no setting to remove the miscarriage note, which affects the app's ability to continue predicting my fertility cycle. I would like to be able to remove pregnancy notes, please and thank you.",
            "I have this app with my partner, her app works well. My app runs in 'partner mode' and hasn't updated in a long time. According to my app she is 145 days late, as she is not 4 months pregnant I believe the app may be malfunctioning. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, this has not helped. The settings button on the interface is unresponsive. Great idea for an app, poor final product.",
            "I enjoy the free portion of the app but recently my widget has stopped working. I checked for and update but there isnt one. I have to delete the widget and replace it everyday to fix it and it defeats the purpose of me using the widget. The widget worked fine the first month or so. The app seems to keep everything together well and I would upgrade for the charts but I would prefer a cheaper subscription for just the charts only. Thanks for the app! I hope the widget issue is fixed soon.",
            "This app helps a lot to keep track. I don't have to try to remember when I'm going to start, when my last menstrual started, helps when I'm going to ovulate and many other things. I would give 5 stars if the app was still completely free."

Example, I updated the notes section of an entry several times throughout the day and every time I clicked \"done\" it updated the notes (yay!) and cleared the symptoms (boo!). I had to go back and re-select symptoms. So it's a little wonky. Otherwise it works well and considering your target audience, I'm sure you expect complaints about functionality to some degree. (LOL!) Overall happy!",

There is a place to track how heavy your flow is in each entry, but it doesn't show that in the chart section where you overview the week or month. That's important and I'd like to be able to see it on the chart and compare over time.",
            "After entering data, the \"done\" button is at bottom of screen which is also near my phone's home button. And it doesn't recognize that I'm trying to tap done. Then the support link goes to \"share\". No way to save data at this point.",

At a time when NHS services are cut to the bone, more and more people will need to rely on self-help and peer support and that's what this app is all about. The app is clear, comprehensive and user-friendly. I particularly liked that people are able to share their own coping strategies. Perhaps most importantly, the app will help to create a community of people who share similar struggles and will be able to support each other. Highly recommended.",

Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.\r\n\r\nTreatment is typically via lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery.

            "This makes absolutely no sense to have on subscription and the lifetime cost is an exorbitant $34.99. It's just a searchable list. You could easily just convert this into a spreadsheet. Obviously a lot of apps like this are being created just to prey on people's problems as opposed to actually helping.",
            "Great app, however I would have given you $3 - $4 for a permanent unlock with no ads. But $69 for lifetime access ! Someone thinks too highly of their glorified list displayer. Let me just burrow your JSON db from GitHub and I'll create my own free version.",
            "I have GERD, and relatively my body rejects many foods, and this app is PERFECT for helping me know which foods I should have and shouldn't have, I hated having to experience my body disliking and rejecting the food for myself, but with this app I no longer have to try things and deal with the consequences, with a click of a button I can see if it'll cause my body to react or not!! And it even lets you know which foods are remedies! Overall this app is great and can really come in hand😁",
            "Not anything I didn't know already once I paid for premium. I was under the impression it would be a diary I could log my trigger foods and tailor my diet. The ingredients aren't elaborate enough it's quite broad. It's basically a paid list on subscription its not worth it at all. Subscription is pointless.",
            "I consider it a really great app. It's nice to have it on hand for a quick search when you're in the grocery store and try to sort things while dealing with acid reflux. Plus it is really great that they continue to update it and give the option to ask for requests for the future list. One thing I hope they'll add in the future is ingredients as well. I constantly look at the list of ingredients for everything, and I'm always nervous with things like malic, folic and ascorbic acid."

Even samsung health comes with free tracker for steps etc. I need a visual to help me assess and so this app and every other Anxiety app I've tried fail as nobody does the tracker for free.",

            "I found this app at the right time. Consider all going on during unprecedented times and consider reading this app. Great tips mentioned to help cope with my depression. I am fond of the idea that the author gave the reader the chance to interact. I feel like there are things I can take from this to help. Pleased with the app.",
            "Dealing with Depression is an awesome app for anyone dealing with depression. The author provided a self care process that’s effective and easy to follow. So many forget that self care is a must. The self care activities provided ways to help you acknowledge and incorporate new routines in your daily routines.",
            "I've battled depression all of my life. I've had more success with rising above depression with the solutions in this app than I have with medication and therapy combined. It makes so much sense, and the solutions are real life tools people can use and apply for quick, sustainable results. Reading this app has changed my life for the better.",
            "A really good list of things and the right information to deal with situation. I have even recommended this app to a friend of mine who appreciated work done by the team. Good work."

        "description": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \r\n\r\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \r\n\r\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \r\n\r\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \r\n\r\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\r\n\r\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \r\n\r\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \r\n\r\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\r\n\r\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \r\nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \r\nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section.",

A cause of yet more pain, rather than less. HOWEVER with 24 hours of contacting their site, Mark Grant the creator and proprietor himself had emailed me with unequivocal accecceptance of the problem AND total assaurance that it would be rectified absolutely ASAP. As indeed it was, with a further 24 hours. With commitment and integrity like that from the App's creator themselves, in tandem with the excellent quality of the App and it's otherwise easy to use functionality, the least I can give it is the maximum FIVE STAR rating.",
            "I downloaded this app after using the Anxiety app. I love that app. This one is pretty awesome too. It's a another tool in the toolbox that helps with dealing with anxiety and pain.",
            "Definitely helps with chronic pain and anxiety. Well worth the money",
            "Buyer beware ... despite the title, only a few of the pain control tracks incorporate EMDR (Bls) technology and the tracks for \"intense pain\" all require the cooperation of another person acting as a pseudo-physical therapist ... if you read the app description on this page you will find tge developer coyly refers to this second human participant as an \"outside material.\" Shame on you Grant, chronic pain suffers are in the forefront of groups of people who shouldn't be exploited.",
            "Don't purchase. The app stops working randomly midway through sessions. It was glitchy the first time I used it, and the second and third times. That was it for me. Asked for a refund and radio silence."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "Looks like a great app, however... could you make it so that you can enter your insurance provider manually? It's a bit frustrating to not be able to add my info when not all insurance companies are listed. Also, I had a problem trying to select a certain one, as no matter what I did, it would only select the incorrect one above it. I would rate it 5 stars if it weren't for these issues. Thanks!",
            "I am so glad I used this app! I was prepared to be frustrated or disappointed, but Im so grateful this app and service is available to us! The doctor was spectacular! Our hometown was struck by Hurricane Michael and my physicians office was included in the destruction, unfortunately. If this was not an option for us, I would have to hunt for a physicians office that open, functioning, and in-network with the added potential to drive like 50 miles away (which is a long trip when one is feeling well, none-the-less sick). I am so grateful I could see someone from home! I highly recommend this!!",
            "It would have been nice to know that there is no access allowed for new patients before they spend time getting this app setup.. ridiculous",
            "I don’t normally write reviews but this is the app I can actually put a seal of approval on. I don’t have time to see the dr. So this is wonderful. All you need is your HSA savings card and do the online paperwork. I got sick one Saturday and just kept getting worse. By 9pm I was very sick. I saw the dr on my own couch wrapped up in my blanket. All I had to do was pick up my antibiotics at the pharmacy drive thru and went home. Again. Great App.",
            "This app is phenomenal. Woke up with strep throat and dont have insurance. I am a veteran and usually just pay the local urgent care clinic a visit when I get sick. Took about 10 minutes to register and set an appointment. Took a photo of the back of my throat and my temperature. Few minutes later my doctor was online and we had a brief consultation. She was friendly, knowledgeable and had a prescription for penicillin out to the pharmacy at the corner of my street by the time we were done. Unless they need to take blood or an X-ray, I cannot imagine ever going back to a brick and mortar clinic again. Highly recommend."

In addition you can also record any symptoms you experience which may be caused by some of these food items. The exact time and date is recorded for each entry, to build up a comprehensive picture of your diet and symptoms on an hour by hour, day by day basis. Any other information you wish to record can be entered as \"Notes\" in to the diary.\r\n\r\nEntering the information is easy because the Intolerance Food Diary remembers every food item, symptom, or note that you enter into the diary, so the next time you come to type in that same information it appears ready to select in a drop down list. This makes filling in the diary much quicker and more reliable.\r\n\r\nOnce you have recorded a useful amount of data on your food consumption and symptoms, the app is able to perform a statistical analysis on this information and then give an indication of which food items might be the most likely cause of a specific symptom you are experiencing (the app disregards any notes you have entered). In addition you can look for foods which, after consumption, may have either a short or a long \"incubation period\" before causing a noticeable symptom. This can be done by adjusting a simple slider to influence how the statistical analysis looks at the data. It should be noted that the information provided in this app does not constitute medical advice. You should always consult with a medical professional before embarking on any course of action which may affect your health.\r\n\r\nThe app also allows you to create reports from the data in your food and symptom diary. You can select entries between any two dates, and export the data to a PDF report document or a CSV data file (for use in a spreadsheet). The information can then be emailed to either yourself or the medical professional who is monitoring your diet.\r\n\r\nPaying a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the app removes all the banner adverts, and allows you access to the \"Backup/Restore Diary\" feature. This allows you to backup your entire diary database to a single file, move that file to a new device, and then restore the diary in full to that new device. You can also do the same with your Food Dictionary database which is built up from all the foods you enter into the app. This allows you to carry on using Intolerance Food Diary with a new device.\r\n\r\nThis app needs certain permissions in order to work correctly. \r\n-- In App Purchases : This is needed to allow users to upgrade to the premium version of the app. However the free version of the app is still fully functional. The only feature non-premium users will not have access to, is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.\r\n-- Photos/Media/Files : Don't worry, the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary, and to save them on your device in a specific \"IntoleranceFoodDiary\" folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.\r\n-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts.\r\n\r\nAll data entered into this app is stored locally on your device.

The only feature non-premium users will not have access to, is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.<br>-- Photos/Media/Files : Don&#39;t worry, the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary, and to save them on your device in a specific &quot;IntoleranceFoodDiary&quot; folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.<br>-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts.<br><br>All data entered into this app is stored locally on your device. It is only accessible by you.",

            "It's very easy to use. Used it for several months now. One thing that could be improved a lot is the analysis of possible intolerances. For example: - It seems the app just tells me what foods I've eaten X hours before the symptom. And obviously the results are just useless. - Add some kind of real correlation analisys between food and symptom occurrences in time that are chosen manually. - At least add a graph between food and symptom occurrences for easy visual comparison.",
            "I really like it's simplicity and you also have the option to receive the summary via email. I had this app back in 2018 when I was eliminating sugar in my body. Deleted it in early 2019 when I became underweight again. But now December 2019, I want to keep track of the food I eat again. So happy to find this for the second time around. This is exactly the app I was looking for. Thank you!",
            "THANK YOU for developing this app. Am finding it a very useful awareness-building and self-training tool. Easy to use. I like it a lot! PS: don't rely on the 'Find intolerences' function though - the algorithm needs a lot of work in order to be useful.",
            "Easy to use. Works well. I'm not sure why we must select \"lunch\" or \"dinner\" etc before entering foods eaten. It's all just food .. Eaten at whatever time it was eaten. This not only requires an extra click, it causes problems if you enter two lunches or dinners in the same day. If that problem we're addressed ... And maybe a better looking and more optimized interface, I would give 5 stars. But I do really like it and it's the best I've found on Android.",
            "Been using for a year and I love it, but it could use a \"search\" feature, for when you want to find the last time you ate ice cream and how it effected you. Right now you have to scroll and find \"ice cream\" through months of entries. Otherwise it's a great app I use all day every day."

For an ad-free experience and additional features, please purchase Sleep Log Pro\r\n\r\nWe suffered from insomnia for decades, with all the usual symptoms that result from rarely or never getting a good night’s sleep: constant fatigue, fuzzy memory, mood swings, diminished cognitive capacity, symptoms of depression, weight gain.\r\n\r\nBut our approach for dealing with these persistent sleep issues was haphazard at best. It wasn’t until we finally decided to take a systematic approach to tackling our sleep problem based on the principles of CBT-I, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, that we finally solved the sleep puzzle.\r\n\r\nOur quality of life has improved enormously since then. Sleep is no longer a hit-or-miss proposition. Going to bed at night is no longer coupled with the stress of wondering “will I or won’t I…?” We now have the tools, methods and strategies we need to consistently get a good night’s sleep almost every night. \r\n\r\nAnd on those nights when sleep remains problematic, we no longer suffer stress and anxiety connected to insomnia–instead, we’re confident that our brain will apply its own internal methods to ensure we make up for the sleep deficit during the following nights, as long as we continue to track our sleep and potential correlations.\r\n\r\nSleep Log is built around the concept of sleep efficiency. Sleep efficiency is defined as the length of time asleep divided by the total time spent in bed. Successful approaches to sleep therapy are generally based on gradually improving one’s sleep efficiency and thereby training the brain that bed is associated with sleep. \r\n\r\nBut we go much further, helping track moods and activities experienced during the day that can have a positive or negative effect on that night’s sleep. Sleep Log currently helps track 14 factors grouped by moods, activities and chemicals–such as anxiety, exercise, and caffeine intake–on a daily basis, then correlates those factors with your sleep patterns. Here’s what we help you track, all factors that can positively or negatively affect your night’s rest:\r\n\r\n• Happiness\r\n• Excitement\r\n• Stress\r\n• Anxiety\r\n• Daylight\r\n• Exercise\r\n• Meditation\r\n• Work intensity\r\n• Screen use\r\n• Tobacco use\r\n• Alcohol consumption\r\n• Sugar consumption\r\n• Caffeine intake\r\n• Sleep medication\r\n\r\nWhat Sleep Log Free doesn’t do\r\n\r\nSleep Log is a sleep and behavioral diary, logging, analysis and visualization tool, not a traditional sleep tracker. We don’t use automatic methods to track the duration or quality of your sleep at night. In our opinion, app-based methods for tracking sleep are generally unreliable and usually require keeping your device very close to, or even on or in, the bed, which itself can disturb your sleep rhythms.\r\n\r\nIntense focus on tracking and visualization of your nightly sleep cycles can also lead to a unhealthy condition called “orthosomnia”, an obsession with getting a perfect night’s sleep, which will have precisely the opposite effect than intended. \r\n\r\nYour sleep cycles will vary naturally depending on your sleep needs any given night. You’re the best judge of how well you slept and how rested you feel. That’s why we use your own subjective estimates of these vital factors, rather than trying to tell you how you should feel based on a chart.\r\n\r\nFree version\r\n\r\nThis is the free version of Sleep Log.

I downloaded this app to track my sleeping patterns because I suspect I may have DSPD, and I want to have something to show my doctor for a referral. I always fall asleep past midnight and wake up late in the day; like yesterday, I didn't get to sleep until 5:30 am and woke up at 10:40 am. I tried putting this in the app, and I couldn't make it work. Seems like a useful app, but can't use it.",
            "Not a bad app, seems to have good features. Unfortunately, I couldn't use any of them because it doesn't allow you to log that you fell asleep past midnight. It says I slept for 20 hours when I slept less than 7. I work a late shift so I'm never home by midnight. If this one thing is fixed I'd love to use this app, but until then it won't work at all for me",
            "i had alcohol one night out of 8 and now it says my alcohol is lower then average. no alcohol is my average its not lower then! i also had one set i saw on the charts looked off, i went back and it said id been awake for 240 minutes through the night. i fixed it but the charts still dont update that information and looks off. the biggest issue is the time scrolls for sleep and wake up, it doesnt snap too well it rolls making it frustrating to pick the time. fix these things and its a 5 star."

            "Nice app. Have used it for years now. Needed some as I have many heart issues. The only problem I have found is that responses list for organ donor. I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

Perhaps adding the option of music during the meditation might be the only improvement I would make... and possibly lengthen the log area just about 20-30 more characters for logging ideas. Thanks again for providing the app.",
            "I love this app! It really works if you give it a chance, it's also something from the Government that's REALLY FREE! I been suffering from PTSD for over 20 years. Living on a fixed income makes it impossible to afford someone elses income. Just by hapenstance I found this & I thank God that I have a way to calm myself down on/in those \"uncomfortable\" times.",
            "Neat, clean, simple, and simply the best meditation app. No ads, no subscriptions - just mindfulness. Kudos to the great work! Note: used to be buggy when I tried a year or two ago. But now (as of summer 2020) it is totally bug-free and faultless.",
            "Such an awesome app that too free of cost...the mindfulness exercise they provide I thought they will charge for it because they are so helpful and for every thing in your life a mindfulness is present whether for emotional distress,nap,sleep, eating,walking everything...thank you so much the developers..god bless you ❤️",
            "By far one of the best and cleanest and most simple mindfulness app I have ever used. The lessons are very helpful too, you can really tell this was created out of good and kind intentions: to help others be more self-aware in order for us to execute decisions thought about thoroughly.

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

I have had such a hard time keeping track of my medications and appointments and this app helps me keep everything organized in one place. It reminds me to take my medications on time, when my next appointment Is and keep track of my condition. The app includes articles that give useful tips, based on your condition. If you have any form of arthritis this app helps a lot.",

            "it seems okay on the surface, and the questions are pretty basic the only problem I see is the phrasing on the page before you start answering questions. it describes autism as a scale. the issue with this is that it makes autism seem more like a step ladder (as if someone can be \"a bit autistic\" or \"very autistic\") when really, the whole \"high/low functioning\" idea only describes how much people mask, which is incredibly harmful to their mental health.",
            "Why can't you put \"?\" for don't understand or it opens up and you can check the check box and or other: write what you mean but allow lots of room, also in the left corner you can push give feedback. And remember you need to make it word like it's for a small child that needs to understand, because that's my comprehension level 🤔.",
            "Am aware that an evaluation through a psychologist is fundamental for proper diagnosis, yet this app gives you a good idea if you in the spectrum or not. I have been obsessed with numbers, patterns and memorizing items since early childhood and found other little quirks along the way as I got older. This test gives me a rating of 33 percent and I see a good bit of truth in that. Thank you. I have shared it with many of my friends and the results are quite amazing and spot on.",
            "The app design is quite nice and technically it works well. However, the contents are really quite... stereotypical. I think they're stupid. It might as well straight up ask me 'Do you think that you have autism?'. Not every autistic person hates socialising. Not every autistic person loves numbers, dates and patterns. Not every aspie or autist struggle with imagination, reading others or planning. It gave me an average score - A group of real psychologists gave me an ASD (and ADD) diagnosis.",
            "Good test, but the interpretation of the result is just bad statistics. Look up the prosecutor's paradox. -- Thanks for the reply...  The app itself is fine... but the fact of making an app that offers this kind of test is gonna get you 1 star from me... sorry!  It's actually not a guide at all, since the probability of you being autistic is very low no matter what you score.  The only solid interpretation is that if you score like a \"neurotypical\" then you probably are one.  So maybe it should be called the Awesomely Neurotypical Test.  The result of tests that make people think they might be autistic is: 1) they clog up the GP and AMH with people who are clearly not autistic, making it even more difficult for adults with ASD to get diagnosed 2) the make people think that \"we're all on the spectrum\", which belittles the suffering that ASD causes.  So, yeah... 1 star."

            "I think there are better apps out there. You have to pay extra for any insights. And it's rubbish at analysing the data adequately. I keep getting a higher temp before LH surge, but not the significant rise of post ovulation. But instead of taking this into account and using all the data it just ignores LH results and gives a wrong date for ovulation. It ignores the fact it is impossible to have LH surge After ovulation has occurred.",
            "Great free app, been using for one year now since I ditched the pill. have avoided pregnancy thus far by using app to better understand my cycle.",
            "It's got potential but as period tracking app you think it'd be able to do the most basic function of tracking you period. This is literally the 1 & only tracking app I've used that does not let you change how long you bleed. It will only use whatever you put when you 1st sign up. I emailed the developers & the response showed they don't even know the difference cycle length & period length which is pretty concerning seeing as their product is about women's period cycles.",
            "I love to track my cycle and thereby understanding how my body works.. I'm using it in combination with the thermometer. I have a few things which should be improved:. 1) I want to add notes to my sleep patterns and to my diet details, 2) please add surfing and Hiit workouts as an exercise option 😁",
            "The intelligent recognition is so wonky. It doesn't load the photos from my camera roll consistently, nor recognize the lines on my OPK consistently either. The layout is ok. The functionality is ok. The fact you have to pay for certain information that is free on many other apps is not within my liking."

Being able to see the different levels of detox was amazing as well and Being able to see how long it takes to get to those levels of detox and what those levels actually meant was great. Definitely recommend if you're trying to quit smoking weed.",

I could list many things that are wrong with this, although I am aware that the developer is working on it. Despite this, it's still a very good app and I highly recommend it to others.",

            "Really like the look and the data choices but when I try to check in (log a session) when I choose to enter some info, a screen pops up offering a health purchase for 3.99 and if I choose not to purchase it, im taken straight back to the start screen and my entered data is lost. Theres no way to check in without purchasing. 1 star for seemingly forced purchase.",
            "I am on day 2 of a T break and this app is rely helping me stay focused and understand my relationship to cannabis. There is a slight bug though. I can't scroll through the text boxes in-app. I can see there is more in the box but I can't scroll to finish reading. Other than that it is wonderful! I would highly recommend payi g for the health tracking, that is my favorite part."

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

        "description": "Here Hear focuses on narrative treatment orientation, allowing users to freely express emotions and tell stories in a completely anonymous manner, objectively recording emotional indicators for a period of time, and providing a simple self-assessment. Use music therapy, mindfulness breathing meditation and listening to stories to alleviate the symptoms of depression, so that users can feel the warmth of companionship.\r\n\r\nNarrative Therapy:\r\nNarrative therapy belongs to the postmodern treatment orientation. Monk (1997) believes that the reality of personal cognition will be influenced by the social, cultural and political context. Narrative therapy helps the client to distinguish his or her own story from a strong story and re-construct a personal life story.\r\n\r\nThe most important key to narrative treatment is to guide the parties to tell their own stories and emphasize that the story is subjective rather than objective. The story will change slowly because of the thoughts, beliefs, and experiences of the parties. Even when it is a continuous and repeated narrative, each time the feelings brought to others are different.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from a victim in the real world to a storyteller, we have the uncomfortable feeling that we are able to take ourselves out of the situation first. At the same time, the storyteller can change the inner feelings of the main character of the story at any time, and then rewrite the ending of the story.\r\n\r\nThrough the guidance of the Here Hear system, users will be able to correctly recognize their emotions and feelings in the storytelling process, cultivate the ability to empathize and listen, not arbitrarily criticize or evaluate anyone, but only responsible for their own growth, developing their personal philosophy of life from their own stories and the stories of others. The longer you use it, the more capable you will be able to rewrite the feelings and endings of the stories, resulting in the process of self-healing.\r\n \r\nMindfulness Meditation:\r\nMindfulness meditation is a self-awareness method that focuses on the present and is completely open. Mindfulness has been confirmed by many studies and has a considerable improvement in mental disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis, panic disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major traumatic syndrome and chronic pain.\r\n\r\nDue to pathological factors, the negative thinking circuit of the brain will continue to circulate, causing cases to suffer mentally. Traditionally, drug treatment and psychotherapy are used to block negative thinking and re-establish a positive thinking circuit to help patients improve their mood.\r\n\r\nMindfulness meditation is a systematic approach that can be self-trained. Long-term training of this skill can help you calm your mood, stop the brain’s forced recall of what has happened, and anxiety and fear of the future, thereby slowing down the symptoms of depression. .\r\n\r\nHere Hear provides a 10-minute mindfulness breathing guide after storytelling to help you divert your attention, feel your breathing, physical changes, exercise your mental resistance, and improve your emotional intelligence.\r\n \r\nMusic Therapy:\r\nMusic can change a person’s mood very quickly. The application principle is to reduce the heartbeat and blood pressure of the listener through a stable music rhythm, thereby relieving tension, anxiety, anger and other emotions, and can achieve the functions of relaxing body and mind, reducing pain and focusing on the present.\r\n\r\nHere Hear’s background music is adapted from Mozart’s No. 4 Violin Concerto, with beautiful melodies and a steady rhythm. We hope that users can feel calm through music without clicking any function.",

Even when it is a continuous and repeated narrative, each time the feelings brought to others are different.<br><br>When we turn from a victim in the real world to a storyteller, we have the uncomfortable feeling that we are able to take ourselves out of the situation first. At the same time, the storyteller can change the inner feelings of the main character of the story at any time, and then rewrite the ending of the story.<br><br>Through the guidance of the Here Hear system, users will be able to correctly recognize their emotions and feelings in the storytelling process, cultivate the ability to empathize and listen, not arbitrarily criticize or evaluate anyone, but only responsible for their own growth, developing their personal philosophy of life from their own stories and the stories of others. The longer you use it, the more capable you will be able to rewrite the feelings and endings of the stories, resulting in the process of self-healing.<br> <br>Mindfulness Meditation:<br>Mindfulness meditation is a self-awareness method that focuses on the present and is completely open. Mindfulness has been confirmed by many studies and has a considerable improvement in mental disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis, panic disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major traumatic syndrome and chronic pain.<br><br>Due to pathological factors, the negative thinking circuit of the brain will continue to circulate, causing cases to suffer mentally. Traditionally, drug treatment and psychotherapy are used to block negative thinking and re-establish a positive thinking circuit to help patients improve their mood.<br><br>Mindfulness meditation is a systematic approach that can be self-trained. Long-term training of this skill can help you calm your mood, stop the brain’s forced recall of what has happened, and anxiety and fear of the future, thereby slowing down the symptoms of depression. .<br><br>Here Hear provides a 10-minute mindfulness breathing guide after storytelling to help you divert your attention, feel your breathing, physical changes, exercise your mental resistance, and improve your emotional intelligence.<br> <br>Music Therapy:<br>Music can change a person’s mood very quickly. The application principle is to reduce the heartbeat and blood pressure of the listener through a stable music rhythm, thereby relieving tension, anxiety, anger and other emotions, and can achieve the functions of relaxing body and mind, reducing pain and focusing on the present.<br><br>Here Hear’s background music is adapted from Mozart’s No. 4 Violin Concerto, with beautiful melodies and a steady rhythm. We hope that users can feel calm through music without clicking any function.",

And since I have no sdcard and you can't specify an email address I tried but could not create a backup or export file. So while I love what it does not having export or backup capability is a show stopper for me. Perhaps the reason the data got wiped with the update is the location of the storage for the app - which I could not find with my file manager.",

            "its okay, but you need so many gems to get the stuff and like you got to wait THREE HOURS, to get only TWO ticket things to play again. Also when you finish a thing it only gives you ONE gem. Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",
            "I like how many stories there are and that you can choose where the path takes you but I do not like that all the more well thought out stories have so many choices that are gems. Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

A Cobb Salad (and what's on it) is very different than a House Salad. Also needs to allow you to add notes more than just the basic IBS flare up symptoms. Not everyone experiences IBS in those ways.

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "I recently switched to a Samsung phone. I'm an avid tumblr user. although the app for iPhone works perfect, so far my experience here has been terrible. I can't scroll through my feed without it glitching a hundred times! Whenever I reblog I'm pushed back all the way to the top of my feed and I lose my spot. plus anywhere you touch on the screen, it will start glitch out and do the opposite of what you want to do. I've been able to make it work, but they need to fix this immediately! 👎",
            "Laggy, blurry images, and buggy. Even for just browsing, I run into problems. Reblogging anything takes you back up to the top of the page w/endless scrolling. All images are blurry and poor quality, plus there's some serious lagin loading them at times. Posting options are extremely limited and many core functions are missing. Overall it's clunky, frustrating and disappointing.",
            "the app is basically unusable. Every time you reblog a post or even so much as open an image your dashboard will refresh and scroll all the way to the most recent post. Oh you were zooming in on a photo you wanted to reblog after 10 minutes of scrolling? Too bad it's gone now! Please for the love of god fix this, I know I'm not the only one with this issue :/",
            "Please for the love of god fix the feature that skyrockets me back to the top of my dashboard every time I click on a picture, video, notes or reblog something. If you're going to have endless scrolling then maybe make sure that it doesn't lose its place every time I try and interact with a post. Sick of starting at the top and trying to scroll down to find my place again. And while I'm at it, how about fixing the video player so I can watch a 6 second vine without it buffering 10 times.",
            "I like Tumblr as a website, but this app is terrible and has been for as long as I've had a Samsung. Each update only seems to make things worse. Less convinient, more clunky to navigate, and more glitchy. My notifications have NEVER worked properly, sometimes it just sends you back to the top of your feed, and the new tagging interface is an inconvenient pain. Please get everything working properly before adding useless interface changes we have to readjust to for no reason and LESS convenience"

Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

Hope this is figured out soon, cause now my streaks are gone 😒 Uhh I reinstalled the app cause I needed to make room for something else at the moment, and I'm trying to get it back on my phone, and it's telling me my device is not supported??? (This was all on the same day btw). It's not like I even had a choice in whether or not to update my phone cause nothing would work without the update.",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 or 4 years now and I've never had any problems until now. I renewed my Amino+ membership and it wouldn't update or let me open the shop. I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",
            "Everytime I try to put a YouTube video on my post, or when I do a live video screening, the link is always saying that it's \"invalid.\" I've been having this problem for months and when I try getting in contact with customer service, they just send me a link to an help center which doesn't help in the slightest! This is so annoying!!!"

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results! I hope everyone who screwed up the yelp app to make more money instead of being actually a useful app dies of a horrible disease!"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

Let me read instructions before starting and give me more than 3 or 4 seconds to play it, and then let me retry, and maybe it would be playable.",

It's one of those games that has a style all its own; very hard to replicate !, It's a blast to play, humorous, lifts my mood no matter the day. Excited to try Dumb Ways To Die3 ! Thank you !

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

        "title": "Sleep Log Pro: The CBT-I sleep diary for insomnia",
        "description": "The pocket sleep therapist using CBT-I methods for chronic or occasional insomniacs.\r\n\r\nWe suffered from insomnia for decades, with all the usual symptoms that result from rarely or never getting a good night’s sleep: constant fatigue, fuzzy memory, mood swings, diminished cognitive capacity, symptoms of depression, weight gain.\r\n\r\nBut our approach for dealing with these persistent sleep issues was haphazard at best. It wasn’t until we finally decided to take a systematic approach to tackling our sleep problem based on the principles of CBT-I, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, that we finally solved the sleep puzzle.\r\n\r\nOur quality of life has improved enormously since then. Sleep is no longer a hit-or-miss proposition. Going to bed at night is no longer coupled with the stress of wondering “will I or won’t I…?” We now have the tools, methods and strategies we need to consistently get a good night’s sleep almost every night. \r\n\r\nAnd on those nights when sleep remains problematic, we no longer suffer stress and anxiety connected to insomnia–instead, we’re confident that our brain will apply its own internal methods to ensure we make up for the sleep deficit during the following nights, as long as we continue to track our sleep and potential correlations.\r\n\r\nSleep Log Pro is built around the concept of sleep efficiency. Sleep efficiency is defined as the length of time asleep divided by the total time spent in bed. Successful approaches to sleep therapy are generally based on gradually improving one’s sleep efficiency and thereby training the brain that bed is associated with sleep. \r\n\r\nBut we go much further, helping track moods and activities experienced during the day that can have a positive or negative effect on that night’s sleep. Sleep Log Pro currently helps track 14 factors grouped by moods, activities and chemicals–such as anxiety, exercise, and caffeine intake–on a daily basis, then correlates those factors with your sleep patterns. Here’s what we help you track, all factors that can positively or negatively affect your night’s rest:\r\n\r\n• Happiness\r\n• Excitement\r\n• Stress\r\n• Anxiety\r\n• Daylight\r\n• Exercise\r\n• Meditation\r\n• Work intensity\r\n• Screen use\r\n• Tobacco use\r\n• Alcohol consumption\r\n• Sugar consumption\r\n• Caffeine intake\r\n• Sleep medication\r\n\r\nWhat Sleep Log Pro doesn’t do\r\n\r\nSleep Log Pro is a sleep and behavioral diary, logging, analysis and visualization tool, not a traditional sleep tracker. We don’t use automatic methods to track the duration or quality of your sleep at night. In our opinion, app-based methods for tracking sleep are generally unreliable and usually require keeping your device very close to, or even on or in, the bed, which itself can disturb your sleep rhythms.\r\n\r\nIntense focus on tracking and visualization of your nightly sleep cycles can also lead to a unhealthy condition called “orthosomnia”, an obsession with getting a perfect night’s sleep, which will have precisely the opposite effect than intended. \r\n\r\nYour sleep cycles will vary naturally depending on your sleep needs any given night. You’re the best judge of how well you slept and how rested you feel. That’s why we use your own subjective estimates of these vital factors, rather than trying to tell you how you should feel based on a chart.\r\n\r\nFree version\r\n\r\nPrefer not to invest your hard-earned cash just yet?

        "descriptionHTML": "<b>The pocket sleep therapist using CBT-I methods for chronic or occasional insomniacs.</b><br><br>We suffered from <b>insomnia</b> for decades, with all the usual symptoms that result from rarely or never getting a good night’s sleep: constant fatigue, fuzzy memory, mood swings, diminished cognitive capacity, symptoms of depression, weight gain.<br><br>But our approach for dealing with these persistent <b>sleep issues</b> was haphazard at best. It wasn’t until we finally decided to take a systematic approach to tackling our sleep problem based on the principles of CBT-I, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, that we finally solved the sleep puzzle.<br><br>Our quality of life has improved enormously since then. Sleep is no longer a hit-or-miss proposition. Going to bed at night is no longer coupled with the stress of wondering “will I or won’t I…?” We now have the <b>tools, methods and strategies</b> we need to consistently get a good night’s sleep almost every night. <br><br>And on those nights when sleep remains problematic, we no longer suffer stress and anxiety connected to insomnia–instead, we’re confident that our brain will apply its own internal methods to ensure we make up for the sleep deficit during the following nights, as long as we continue to track our sleep and potential correlations.<br><br>Sleep Log Pro is built around the concept of <b>sleep efficiency</b>.

            "I love the app and use it every day. The only problem I have is that when you enter when you went to bed the latest it will allow you to enter is 11:45pm. Last night I went to bed at 12:15am. Unfortunately I cant reflect that now becUze it wont let me roll over the day.",
            "The sliders you use to log sleep, awake, and habits times are hard to use. They can slide to values other than the ones you're recording by accidentally touching them as you're navigating around the screen. I don't care for the interface much. Discontinuing. Wish I could get my money back.",
            "(email feedback didn't get through) The main issue that needs fixing is scrolling through the sleep log where you enter data. You have to be very careful where you put your finger as any touch and swipe up/down will change the sliders of options you've already selected. That's not normal android app behavior. The UI needs some work. Edit: Developer replied. Updated rating and will rate higher following next update.",
            "**EDIT: Since my review, the developers started working on a nap feature. I am really excited to use it, and its so nice that the developers are responsive and care. Thank you!! It's a really nice app-- but I can't add daytime naps? I may have narcolepsy and was hoping I could log all of my hours slept per day into the app- but it only accounts for overnight sleep, when a majority of my sleep happens in naps throughout the day.",
            "The interface might be slightly confusing at times, but overall, it's a very useful app. One thing that I feel is missing is the option of choosing the way I finally woke up, i.e. naturally or because the alarm clock went off. That's a very significant factor in my case and it would be good to include it in the analysis."

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",
            "One of the Best scary apps in android..but u guys have to do some new challenges or new maps i mean bigger maps ..like if u got 20/20 money u go outside and u keep playing to get a car to run away or somthing like that"

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least.

            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

        "description": "Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and a number of hormones. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as mumps, and tumors among others. Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis. It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic pancreatitis these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.",

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

However the exercise does not seem to be using the data from the calibration feature which sets your breathing rate.

Thanks for making this great game! I have never played it before, so I have rated it with 3 starts. If the problem f",
            "I loved this game very much😍😍😍. I played this game many times in Practice Mode until I mastered this. But there is a glitch that you should fix. When Granny reached the stair in the 2nd Floor and I left the door open, I hide under the bed, she is only at the end of the stairs, and WHAM!!! Instant jumpscare. Please fix it and all of the rest of the glitches. Thank you😘😘😘.",

(For some reason) Thank you for making this game! And the easier way to play the game with an enemy is with Grandpa. Thank you the developers for making this game!",

I think that the first chapter of this game is a little bit hard for me .It seems that the house was small but there were too much of secret doors .But in this we can easily explore the house 🏠 in the practice mode.GRANDPA has added a lot of attraction in this game.

If you are one of the 65 million Americans reporting lower back pain and discomfort on a regular basis, it’s no wonder that we seek relief from this additional stress and strain.\r\n\r\nExercises to Treat Low Back Pain and Sciatica\r\nLower back pain treatment is solved in a number of ways, but not all of these options are accessible to everyone. For those experiencing mild to moderate pain on occasion, all that might be necessary is a simple pain management medication. Other options might be surgical relief or a chiropractic protocol for moderate to severe pain. If cost is an option and you find yourself in need of pain relief in between medical and chiropractic appointments, however, it might be beneficial to try some simple exercises at home to get the blood flowing and those vertebrae moving.\r\n\r\nThese lower back strengthening exercises are a great way to strengthen your low back and your core in general. They also help strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, and other pelvic muscles.\r\n\r\nDoing these exercises regularly has proven to ease lower back pain and provide some relief from the stress that chronic pain can bring to your daily life. Practice these on a consistent basis, and you’ll be feeling better with each repetition.\r\n\r\nDo each of these exercises for 1 minute, emphasis on technique not speed! Take time to hold the positions and really work those muscles. Have a rest in between the sets.",

        "description": "Easily learn Spanish phrases and words! Speak Spanish with confidence!\r\n\r\nThe “Learn Spanish” app has many useful Spanish phrases and words (e.g., “Thank you!”, “How much?” or “A table for two, please!”). When you tap a phrase, the app speaks it aloud. There is no guessing as to how to pronounce the words. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the snail icon to hear the words more slowly. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the turtle icon to hear it more slowly.

List of doctors is US-only, the \"coach\" only contacted me about 3 times, and if you do any yoga at all the exercises will be laughable. An extra star as the symptom tracker, while imperfect, is pretty comprehensive and useful. Not worth spending money on though, and the \"articles\" treat you like a child.",

The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure. The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There are a number of subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.",

I'd rather not know I reached that \"milestone\" if it means the game wont stutter. And I've been playing this for awhile before I reviewed. The stutter happens. Every. Time. Kinda makes u feel like the game is rigged. Purposely making u lose because it stutters. Super irritating, hence the 3 stars. Woulda gave it 5.",

            "This app is an extraordinary tool. It still has some kinks to work out, but the team working on it is very helpful and dedicated to making geopain the best pain recording app it can be. I've personally had a few errors come up. I reported the errors through the app and had a personal response from a real person within a few hours. Even better, I've been kept with the same person through all of my messages so I have that familiarity. Eric, has been kind and attentive to my concerns and issues, he's even listened intently to my suggestions for the app, including asking me deeper questions about how I thought it would work if changed and what situations I would use the changes in. If you're having issues, reach out through the speech bubble in the top right corner of the app. This company cares about the people in pain who can benefit from geopain. They will treat you with respect and help get things going again. I give it 4 stars because, as it is a new app, it still has places to improve. I know this will be a 5 star app when it's kinks have been worked out!",
            "I've only just started using the app after seeing an article on The Mighty but it certainly looks promising. A way of being able to show exactly where my pain is is the one thing the app I've been using for the last couple of years is missing. I don't think I'll stop using FibroMapp as I like the variety of ways data can be displayed, but I think that GeoPain will be a really useful way of showing my doctors where I'm in pain and how intense that pain is.",
            "This app would be perfect if it had an offline mode, with an option to sync entries to whatever entity is storing them already, like several other health apps I use. Turning wifi on slows my phone down immensely and drains the battery, so I don't like to do it unless I really need to. I'd probably do several entries a day if I could just open the app and do them and not have to turn wifi on and then login.",
            "This app is a wonderful tool to help you and your Drs communicate when your not at the Drs office. The reports you can create and print out or email are wonderful so your Drs can see what has been going on between appointments. I have shown my pain Dr this app and he thinks this is a wonderful app, the best he's seen so far to record and report pain. Thank you GeoPain!!",
            "creating your first pain record is simple to do. follow the pop up prompts when selecting your areas of pain is simple to do. selecting the sext steps is easy to follow as well. the easy to use interface is great for everyone needing this app to record their pain. creating reports and sending them require a little thought, but easy to work through routine will have you reporting to your doctor in no time. I look forward to future editions with more helpful functions for the patient and doctor."

            "Its a great game, but with a game so simple how come there are so many glitches?? 5 consecutive levels freeze up during a stupid ad to where I have to back out of the game and reopen it! Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

        "title": "Hepatitis B: Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment",
        "description": "Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.\r\nThe virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five main hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis B Guide, Hepatitis B Disease Management & Hepatitis B Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis B Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

The flowing hash marks demarkate your route which also is a plus for when I need to set this up for my grandma so she can get to her appointments without me, only when I'm too busy. I highly recomend anyone who frequents Overlook or even someone for the first time, download this app so you can find your way to your doctor's office without the hassle of feeling like your in Jim Henson's Labyrinth.

Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors.  Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person's reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person. During diagnosis a person's culture must also be taken into account. As of 2013 there is no objective test. Schizophrenia does not imply a \"split personality\" or \"dissociative identity disorder\" – conditions with which it is often confused in public perception.",

(details explained in settings)\r\n\r\nNever should your phone or tablet become slower and battery hungrier after lots of apps installed. With Greenify, your device can run almost as smoothly and lastingly as it did the first day you had it!\r\n\r\nGreenify help you identify and put the misbehaving apps into hibernation when you are not actively using them, to stop them from lagging your device or leeching the battery, in a unique way! They can do nothing without explicit launch by you or other apps, while still preserving full functionality when running in foreground.\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs in the XDA forum (http://goo.gl/ZuLDnE) or G+ community (http://goo.gl/MoszF).\r\n\r\nGreenify NEVER EVER collects your personal data despite the capability of accessibility service, it just takes advantage of it to automate the hibernation procedure.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Greenifying an app implies that you are aware that all the background functionality (service, periodic task, event receiver, alarm, widget update, push message) of this app will become out of service during the hibernation except when you are using this app.\r\n\r\nNEVER greenify alarm clock apps, instant messaging apps unless you don't rely on them. Please do verify the impact of greenified apps on which you heavily rely.\r\n\r\nNote: Greenify does need background running services for auto-hibernation to work. It is designed and implemented in extremely lightweight and nearly zero CPU and battery consumption.\r\n\r\n=== PERMISSIONS ===\r\n\r\nDEVICE ADMIN: This app uses administrator privilege to turn off the screen immediately after automated hibernation on non-root devices. This permission will be requested explicitly for your consent only if required.\r\nDRAW OVER OTHER APP: To dim the screen during automatic hibernation when the screen is expected to be off.\r\nDISABLE SCREEN LOCK & BIND ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE: For automatic hibernation to work on non-root devices.\r\nGET ACCOUNTS & WRITE SYNC SETTINGS: Control the account sync of apps if its sync task is too frequent.\r\n\r\nThis app uses Accessibility services, to automate the hibernation procedure.\r\n\r\n=== FAQ ===\r\n\r\n* It seems that automatic hibernation is not working.\r\n* Some of my greenified apps (e.g. Google Maps) seems not hibernating.\r\n* I want to greenify system apps!\r\n* De-greenified apps still got no push notification!\r\n……\r\nRead here: http://goo.gl/99lNYp\r\n\r\n=== Translation ===\r\n\r\nAll translations are created by community volunteers and open for contribution: http://goo.gl/zCCDce\r\n\r\n=== Donation ===\r\n\r\nIf you love Greenify, please consider the \"donation package\" (http://goo.gl/fpz5l) for extra experimental features:\r\n\r\n* Greenify system apps\r\n* In-depth details about how apps behave on your device\r\n* And more",

            "I've been using this since my Oppo A37 (very old model) until now with my Oppo Reno 4. And this works very great on both! It stops my battery draining very fast like normally it decreases every minute but ever since I am using this app, my battery life can continue for another 2 hours. I can't live without this. Please don't try to update this like there were so many changes, I like it to be this simple already. Thank you!!!!",
            "I don't usually leave reviews but I felt that I should with this one. I have a Galaxy s8 plus. It's an awesome phone except for the battery, especially after the last update. I took a chance and downloaded Greenify and noticed a difference the first day. My battery definitely lasts MUCH longer and the bonus is there's no ANNOYING ADS! Seems to be a great app so far.",
            "This app called greenfy.apk, please this app helps with hybernating and closing all background apps running at your background and draining your battery live span. It works perfectly on both rooted and non-rooted devices. It will show you all the system and non system apps running currently and the time you started running those up and stiil counting!!! Then you can either choose to hybernate it or let it run so, I think this app is perfect for those using iPhone and we the Android lover",
            "I've always used this app, no matter what device I use. Now I'm using RealMe 5 Pro (not rooted), and I decided to finally purchase the donate version, and it somehow doesn't work :/ when it force closes an app, the next app's 'Force Close' option is grayed out, so in the end, I have to force close each one individually. I really love this app, and I'm hoping for a fix soon.",
            "I have been using Greenify for years now and it has saved me so many times when I am out and about by saving battery for me. One thing to note is that it is not for those who don't know what they are doing. With that said, Greenify should include more instructions and short explanations(such as the meaning of backgroud-free). A lot of bad reviews are from people who don't know how it works and don't know it's limitations."

            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

        "description": "Mood diary is a diary app that allows you to manage your emotions by selecting the icon that matches your mood and describing the situation in one sentence.\r\nIt also notes mood statistics in order to help you evaluate yourself.\r\n\r\nYour mental condition could be worse than your physical condition.Being able to acknowledge your mental fluctuations, you will be able to prevent stress and physical disorders caused by stress.If you note and visualize the fluctiations of your emotions, you may realize the causes. This awareness will lead to the first step in organizing your mind. Also, you may be able to achieve an ideal emotional state by noting and reflecting on what made you happy and what you enjoyed in the past.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a stressful event and fell into negative emotions, try keeping a diary of those feelings and events. By putting these in the diary, it will help release you from the negative emotions and make your mind brighter and clearer. \r\nThis way, you can see the positive effects that can be obtained at the moment of writing a mood diary. And if you keep writing the diary, you may find out patterns of mental ups and downs. It will have a long-term effect of enabling you to objectively look back at yourself and your past emotional states.\r\n\r\n\r\n●Mental condition changes due to various factors\r\n\r\nMental conditions can get better or worse due to various factors such as sleep, weather, hormone balance, and events of the day. \r\nIn today's society, which is also known as a “stressed society”, anxiety and frustration can make our emotions unstable throughout our daily lives. And there are a lot of occasions and circumstances that hide and distort this annoyance and depression. Accumulating negative emotions can lead to stress, and if you don't express these emotions in some manner, you'll continue to feel stressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n●Physical and mental disorder and stress\r\n\r\nStress is a chemical phenomenon in the body, but if it becomes chronic, it can cause not only body fatigue, stiff shoulders and gastrointestinal pain, but also serious psychosis and insomnia. To prevent this situation, firstly, you must be aware of the physical effects of stress. It is necessary to observe how your heart reacts when you feel depressed/annoyed and how physical sensations change. It will be easier to understand these changes by writing a sentence about the reasons causing you stress, and noting the emotions at that time.\r\n\r\n●Visualize your mood with a diary\r\n\r\nNoting your mood in a diary is a process of extracting and visualizing your emotions, irritability, irritations, and worries that tend to accumulate in yourself. Diaries that focus on positive emotions are called \"Praise Diaries\" or \"Good Things Diaries\", and those that focus on negative emotions are called \"Stress Diaries\" or \"Anger Logs\". \r\nNoting the emotions that you felt will help you feel better and help reduce frustration in the future. This will help you in controlling your emotions sooner without accumulating negative feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n●Recommended for\r\n\r\n・ People too bothered to write a diary every day.\r\n・ People too bothered to write down sentences.\r\n・ People that tend to forget to write a diary.\r\n・ People that want to keep a diary even when away from home.\r\n・ People who want to work on their mental and physical health, but don’t know where to start.\r\n・ People who want to do self-monitoring.\r\n・ People who want to be able to control their emotions.\r\n・ People who want to note their mood at a glance.\r\n\r\n\r\n●Features of this app\r\n・ Easy to record and easy to continue.\r\n・ Able to help you control your mood.\r\n・ The reminder function makes you not forget.\r\n・ With convenient statistics function.\r\n・ Note everyday events along with the mood of the moment.\r\n・ You can see your mood of the day at a glance with the facial expression icon.\r\n・ You can objectively understand your mood.",

You shld've made it a website because think about it. once someone use this app they are not going to use it again its a one time thing its not like they are going to check for a breast cancer every day. An app is something that stays on your phone so i think you shldve made it a website. I am just shocked kudu ventures decided to invest like 2 million birr on this 😂like whats the bussiness plan here??",
            "They really shoukd tell you what language something is in before you install it. When everything else I readbis in English, it's a fair assumption that the app will be in English as well. FALSE ADVERTISING!!",
            "This is a very great app to teach anyone self breast examination... very intuitive and very helpful. Please make it more interactive for version 2.",
            "As a Physician in Ethiopia, I can testify to the need of an app like this in our country. This is a very noble and well-crafted initiative. Well done!!",

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

Its A Not Kind of fun game now The Update Ate whole of the game. I Promise you If You Change It. it will get more Rates. Its Not only for me Fun, But You to change your new boring game to the old",

            "Listen here dude the old version \"Tom loves Angela\" was way better. This version is boring and you can see them kiss, hug, dance which is gross. I want to the version when Angela is on the balcony and Tom on the roof, and you could write letters 📝 to Angels and she would answer, also you would sing a song called \"you get me\". Do not install this game. Not good game dev. I have no idea how this game has so many 5 stars.",
            "It's a good game, But I want to add some more features in this games like Tom and Angela live with each other. They go out and we have to dress up them. We have to make food for them, decorate there house and many more. And I also want some action scenes that some thieves took Angela with them and we Tom will go on a mission to rescue her. Please add these features. 🙂",

They could sing songs and chat (I would troll her) She was on a balcony and Tom was on a roof, there could be a earthquake and Ginger could throw a flower pot on Tom's head. Tom could give her gifts and stuff, And there was really fun games as well. This Version This version is really boring. All they can do is Kiss, Hug, dance and read cards. That's literally it. It's super boring, If I could I would give it no star."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. 😊",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

It wasn't hard each game is seconds long and easy probably even to easy for her skill level. When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",

            "Funny thing about this thing I worry about distance from the round table or the one that I have a great example for me a min and I have a good idea of what is going on in my computer though and i'm still trying to find a way out for your English papers to be there for dinner somemore but I think that u are not assessed.",
            "Not very fun. The game looks super gross and way too many adds.please fix this asap. The game is also very discusting. The add looked fun but l read other comments and said the same thing. I got it to see if it was true and it was true. So read other comments before getting the game. The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying. Not a fan!!",
            "I find this game okay, I guess. It's just the ads that really ruin the experience for me. You get an ad every level, and each level takes less time than the ad you receive after."

            "Too minimal- it is a great app and i love the simple layout and the concept, but in comparison to other trackers it is very lacking. i think it should offer notifications for upcoming periods. also an option to log back pain would be nice. hope to see improvement because i believe in this apps potential!",
            "For a transgender male, who still has periods, it's kind of hard to find period tracker apps that don't get me feeling dysphoric because of their pink and flowery design. This app is very good for someone like me, with it's simplistic look. Log28 is easy to use and I don't feel like less of a guy for using this.",
            "Finally a period app that is not pink and has a simple design! Great work, developers. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the design could be a little more modern and minimalistic, but it's still better than the pink apps. Please, don't ruin it with ads.",
            "I love the mature, simple, no frills design! I like everything about this app, except for the fact that you can't back up your data to Google drive or Dropbox. More mood and physical symptom choices would be nice too. Thank you.",

            "Incredibly fast and affordable! I was talking to a Dr. in less than 30 minutes and he called in my prescription. Another 30 minutes and it was ready to be picked up and I never left my couch! No insurance needed, doesn't matter if there's a pre-existing condition, no need for video, just took a pic. Only $10 a visit!",
            "Wasnt able to help me medically which wasnt a big deal, but then I had multiple charges on my credit card and just found more the next month. Horrible customer service over the phone. If they charge me again next month I would rather get a new card and change all my autopay rather than deal with them again.",
            "Medek is fantastic! Getting sick is always inconvenient, but the process of taking off work, driving to the doctor and waiting around in their sick room just to get a diagnosis is the literal definition of adding insult to injury. Being able to get diagnosed from wherever I am without having to do all of that is such a relief that I'd happily pay twice what Medek costs just to avoid the hassle that getting sick causes. Great app, even better service. I cannot recommend it strong enough."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

        "description": "Altitude sickness, the mildest form being acute mountain sickness (AMS), is the negative health effect of high altitude, caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation. Symptoms may include headache, vomiting, feeling tired, trouble sleeping, and dizziness. Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) with associated shortness of breath or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) with associated confusion. Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long term exposure to high altitude. \r\nAltitude sickness typically only occurs above 2,500 metres (8,000 ft), though some are affected at lower altitudes. Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness, a high degree of activity, and a rapid increase in elevation. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities. \r\nPrevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than 300 metres (1,000 ft) per day. Being physical fit does not decrease the risk. Treatment is generally by descending to a lower altitude and sufficient fluids. Mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen, acetazolamide, or dexamethasone. Severe cases may benefit from oxygen therapy and a portable hyperbaric bag may be used if descent is not possible. Treatment efforts, however, have not been well studied. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Altitude Sickness symptoms, Altitude Sickness management, Altitude Sickness causes, Altitude Sickness diagnosis, Altitude Sickness Prognosis, Altitude Sickness Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Altitude Sickness apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

In an effort to make the data as useful as possible, there is a checkbox on the symptom page to mark that date as having info important to discuss with your doctor. There is an export page that will let you save the results in an email or spreadsheet. This data can be complete, or filtered on \"Important to discuss\". You can also re-import your data in the event you get a new phone or need to do a factory reset.\r\n\r\nFor immediate viewing of trends in ratings and other data input, graphing of the results is included. Views are available for 1 Week, 2 Weeks, 1 Month and 3 Months.\r\n\r\nFor those people that have difficulty breathing as a result of their MG, there is also a “Single Breath Count” tracker built in.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency where the user may not be able to speak, an Emergency Information page has been added. In addition to the standard info that would be on a Medical ID bracelet, there is an Emergency Notify button that automatically calls and initiate a text to the primary emergency contact to let them know you are in trouble and where you are. When this button is pressed, a message to First Responders is shown to help them with some of the unique aspects of our condition. See screenshot for more information. (This function requires additional permissions for Location and Call Phone).\r\nThis emergency page also contains a section at the bottom to allow for the patient or caregiver to organize their thoughts in order to give “the bullet” to an ER triage nurse or other medical professional. It uses the commonly used SBAR format. Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendations.\r\n\r\nSince MG is a “Snowflake Disease” and presents differently in each person, the app provides the allowance to select only those symptoms that you want to track and rate:\r\n-Swallow Strength\r\n-Neck Strength\r\n-Cheek soreness/strength\r\n-Breathing impact\r\n-Extremity strength\r\n-Balance\r\n-Altered Speech\r\n-Lip Closure Strength\r\n-Fatigue impact\r\n-Appetite\r\n-Pain level\r\n-State of Mind (Depression)\r\n\r\nThe app also allows you to track the most common oral medications used for MG:\r\n-Prednisone\r\n-Mestinon (dose defaults to 60mg but can be adjusted in Utilities)\r\n-180mg ER Mestinon\r\n-Weight\r\n-Percent Body Fat\r\n-Daily Steps\r\n-Sleep Hours\r\n-Blood Pressure\r\n-Peak Flow Meter readings\r\n\r\nSelection boxes are also provided to indicate if you have experienced some of the other symptoms that don’t really lend themselves to rating:\r\n-Ptosis\r\n-Nasality\r\n-Facial Tingling\r\n-Nasal Regurgitation\r\n-Throat Residue Issues\r\n-Sore Throat\r\n-Double Vision\r\n\r\nSince most neurologists also use either the MG Quality of Life survey or the MG Activities of Daily Life (ADL) to keep tabs on how patients are doing, the app incorporates both of these surveys and provides the capability to export the results to an email or to a spreadsheet. \r\n\r\nThere is also a page that lists the pertinent information about drugs that are contraindicated for people with MG so you can easily check on new prescriptions while you are still with your doctor and potentially ask for a substitute if necessary.",
