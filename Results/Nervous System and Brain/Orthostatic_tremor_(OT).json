            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

If I had to change one thing about it though I would put advice like if your heart rate is high do this... is your heart rate is low do this... but I love the app, thank you.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of the type of experiment wherein sound is reproduced by analyzing the vibrations of a bag of potato chips through a window in a silent video; that's basically why I accept that this app can work, and work well. It's in the ballpark of what a Polar H10 chest strap is telling me, and the live readout seems to correspond with what I'm feeling. I'd rate it five stars if I could save the line graph as an image. I'll change the rating if I figure it out. Good app, all told.",
            "Great app. I actually compared its Heart Rate results with a expensive BP Monitor that I have, and I was surprised to see that the Heart Rate reading was very close to the one my expensive BP monitor gave me. I recommend this app. It's a very handy thing to have on your phone when your away from home and can't take your reading with your regular medical monitor.",
            "I have a issue that specialists and doctors are finding hard to workout. This app just showed it occurring. So it does catch what heart is doing. Its not meant to diagnois but atleast you can save it and take to a professional for assessment.",
            "Not sure if the app isnt very good, or if I have a heart problem, because the app was giving me drastically different results back to back, and very up and down during test. I was consistent with testing method. Good reviews though so I'll have to test more."

It's so visual and simple to utilize + catches to add to your veggies, action, rest and so forth. The charts are useful as well and weight health tracker. Keeps me responsible and in rivalry with my self. I like the point framework and focusing on day by day best. The gatherings are incredible for help and data as well.",

It is extremely simple to use, very accurate and records and stores results, giving me something very meaningful to show my cardiologist. One addition I'd like to see is a small text field to allow a recording to be annotated with activity information to add important context.",
            "This app has picked up on irregularities well. And is accurate in detecting rate. But I really wish there was a way to make a note to say what was going on when I used it at that particular time. Something other than \"resting\", \"warm up\" etc. Sometimes I get palpitations and will check my rate. Would be nice to be able to add a note like \"palpitations while cooking dinner\". Then I can fill my doctor in when I see him next.",
            "Best! Ive used many... I suffer from mental and physical health issues. When my anxiety shoots up, I have to do breathing exercises, and I have to monitor my heart rate. So I know what, and when things are happ. This app really is incredible that works immidiate, and you can print/Share out your own cardiograph!!! That is huge for me I mean huge! You can go back to different dates, whatever you want to do if you're looking for something to monitor your heart rate I absolutely recommend this!",
            "clean and simple. this type of app measure bpm by colour change noted by camera. you can see how fast your heart beat by covering camera with finger and make sure flashlight on and light goes throught finger. open video camera with flashlight on. you will see slightly color change on screen with heartbeats!",

It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

            "So far so good. This app keeps pace with my dedicated finger pulse/oximeter (choiceMMed OxyWatch C29) Yeah, sometimes some patience is needed, the app will tell you when it's reading & when it's done. (My platform: Samsung Galaxy Note 8) UPDATE; Profound sadness:... My NEW platform is a Samsung Galaxy \"Note 20 Ultra 5G\". This app won't work (incompatible) on that platform. 😪",
            "Works but not too sure about the calibration. Bigger problem... The free version only allows 3 readings per day?! Wouldn't it make more sense for the pay version to include things like history but allow unlimited readings? Not going to uninstall it but absolutely would not consider paying for it due to this.",
            "I tried this app several times. Oxygen level says 99%. I have COPD, and have never been over 96% any time I've been checked at a clinic. I also have a Pacemaker that when at rest, my heart always is at 66 BPM. This App shows 61 BPM. I would only be able to play with this. I'd never trust it because my health is more important. If you need to count on it, buy one from a Pharmacy. I did.",
            "This was the first oximeter app that actually picked up my heartbeats or oxygen spo2 settings at all. So I am pretty happy with it right now. 9/30/2020 EDIT: After first usage yesterday evening, I went ahead and paid for the premimum version. Have managed, with quite abit of difficulty, to get it eventually to read my oxygen sat level and heart beat but have not been able to get it to store the data. Not quite so happy with 8t today, sadlyy• EDIT: rebooting the phone got it all working properly",
            "This is the only app in the store that has the functionality to measure the spo2 values.. the readings are consistent with an actual oximeter.. got the platinum edition.. Only feature I'm missing is the ability to store different profiles for different people.. also an option to disable reading on start.. Other than these, this is an awesome app :)"

Also the reminders rarely happen when they are scheduled. It is the latest and even when it says I should be getting reminders they don't actually come thru most of the time. But thanks for the input",
            "I love this app and use it all the time. Would love: 1) to be able to use it on my Chromebook. Having to choose between the tiny phone screen and our tv (which is in high demand) isn't ideal 2) to be able to save check-ins on the app itself. The sharing tool doesn't always work and then I have to either fast forward through the workout to get my picture back (which messes up my count for my badges) or I lose out on the check in.",

Also love that it includes the nutrition plans! I can always easily find the recipe I'm looking for! I highly recommend for women looking to be challenged, uplifted, encouraged, and understood! 💗💕💗",
            "I remember when this app was busy and some features wouldn't work. But it looks like a lot work was put into it to improve it! Easily shareable, reminders to keep you accountable, and you can simply cast to your tv (If you have the corresponding device lol) It's awesome and motivating! I find myself always signing up for the new programs",
            "I was really disappointed that the programs are so cumbersome. You can't stream the workout on your computer which is how I normally follow workouts in that garage and I wasn't abe to cast them to my tv either. If you want to print material I would have to download on my phone email to myself to keep or print from my computer. I'm sorry I dont want to follow a workout on a phone"

            "I love this app! It has so many different guided meditations to choose from. I love the music while I'm studying or reading. I did have a problem with the tracks cutting out, but customer service fixed this as soon as i asked so if you have a similar problem, don't assume it's the app. It was just the settings on my phone and super simple to fix. I am glad i bought the lifetime subscription. Hypnotherapy works well when I can't sleep and that is priceless!",
            "Pretty wide variety of meditations and teachings. I really wanted to give feedback about their emails, I could not find anywhere else to write to someone. They are always in a very light grey font which no one over 50 could possibly read. I wish I could attach a picture because they will bold things which can be read perfectly, so about 6 to 10 words of the entire email are legible and the rest of the email is lost.",
            "Not sure what all the negative reviews are about here.... This is by far the greatest app I have used for meditation and hypnotherapy! It saved my life! Thank you breathe!!!",
            "Nice selection of tracks. The pay version seems WAY too pricey, so if never try it, but the free tracks are really nice. I use it only for going to sleep, but there are a lot of meditation options, too.",
            "I haven't fully experienced the free version yet so this isn't a complete review but one thing i immediately noticed is that i can't cast audio to a Google device. I would recommend adding this feature in a future update."

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

Even if you manage to find and select your tags (slow!!!), the final \"add tags\" at the top does not work at all (still stuck there 3 hours later). Please add Tai chi / qigong to types of activity as their HRV impact different",
            "Great app for daily measurements, the app went through changes, initially simple, really easy to use, then cluttered hard to find anything, current stage is actually simple to use again. Definitely worth using. Great work by developers.",
            "Seems to produce really great data. Good interface.. For a free app, it seems too good too be true! I say this in a good way.",
            "Excellent app for monitoring heart rate variability. No ads and feature rich. Highly recommended.",
            "Disappointed. I've used this app for years. I used to love it. The recent revision makes it harder to take readings - more screens to page through to get to the work, won't connect with my Polar H10, long delays for any function. It just isn't reliable, simple, or easy. I don't think they do any user testing to inform their design and flow engineering."

            "It kept saying it didn't detect anything no matter what I did. When it finally worked it said 40 bpm, not true. I didn't really like it. Just my opinion though.",
            "Used once and then it told me i had to purchase! Not free!!! Worked great when i did use it. It has weekly purchase options available, but i dont recall anything about a price being added after i downloaded it. Very unhappy about that.",
            "This does exactly what is says, with zero bloat or hassle. There are simple real-time instructions on screen for how to use, and get the best and most accurate results. The app also allows you to turn on or off your flashlight simply while using the app to increase accuracy, but also warns you that depending on your phone your finger might get hot.  It does all of this with a UI that is so streamlined there is basically zero learning curve. Just install, follow the onscreen instructions and voila, Instant and accurate heart rate info.  It is simple, clean and accurate. I measured my heart rate with a blood pressure machine at a drugstore while using the app simultaneously with the other hand and it was consistently within about 5 BPM of the final output of the blood pressure machine.  After a short run the app showed my BPM increase accurately (tested with this Sony wristband thing my friend has).  Ad Free, Bloat Free, In App Purchase Free, and only asks for permission to use your camera. No other heart rate app else even comes close.",
            "You have to provide a basic version for free . If it works useful way can go for premium version. I have seen very different heart ratings in 3 days ..Felt it is not working properly.. just uninstalling now",
            "this is the best Heart rate app I've seen in a long time. No bloat, continous measuring, a graph background to measure intensity, can toggle flash on or off and syncs with Google fit. Excellent. i don't rate many apps but this is with my time so others can experience the app that allows others away. It would be better if an audio beep was added for the heart rate but this is really good"

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "Nice app. Have used it for years now. Needed some as I have many heart issues. The only problem I have found is that responses list for organ donor. I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

I love WeatherBug because they have a graph with an air quality forecast over several hours. The current air quality is often from a Stadium, which is higher than where I am. This app lets me know how the air is down in the soup. The WeatherBug report sometimes comes from a nearby school. Then it's more accurate. I use both apps regularly.",

            "The content of the app is great, and it is very easy to navigate. My main issue with this app is that regardless of WiFi signal or mobile data coverage, videos stop to buffer regularly - often at the most inconvenient times! If I have to sprint for one minute, I don't want an additional minute or two while the app buffers! I don't believe Apple customers have this issue, yet we all pay the same!? Fix the glitches and allow Android users to preload workouts.",
            "No where near the iOS app. The bike and tread are Android based, this app should be much better. If you don't have the option to use iOS don't waste your money with a subscription at this point. The options available on iOS (workout plans and preloading to limit data use and buffer)are far superior to what is offered here. If they valued our time and money like they do iOS this would be a great app. Don't waste your time.",
            "Major bug with the videos!!! Dev team please fix. Each time we try to do an exercise the video continuously buffers at random points. I have been playing 4K videos on Amazon Prime on my phone and have had no connection issues. Love the content but incredible unrelaxing during a yoga session when the prerecorded stream buffers randomly! I have purchased a subscription so this needs to be fixed or I would like a refund as its unusable! May i suggest downloadable content like Nike Run?",
            "What is there to say about Peloton and the instructors that live inside this magical app except that its pure genius. Every class you take it feels like you're right there with them. They know exactly when you feel like giving up and will call you out on it. The workouts make sense and the music adds a whole other level to it. Most times its just stock music and it does not inspire. These guys have the best of the best, music is key. Well done!",
            "Android app is the worst I've seen. Why is it that i cannot see my own challenges or see those that I'm following? Why can I not see the same details as that on the Apple app? Do peloton and apple have a partnership so android gets pushed to the side? A major enhancement to this app is needed! Even the app on roku is terrible. Poor IT management @ Peloton...along with questionable leadership. Get ur act together!"

            "I love this app a lot! I use it daily and it really helps to write down my feelings. Especially when I just feel like when I can't tell anyone. And plus the the quotes are very motivational and true. I love it! The reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is a lot of stuff not worth paying for that much for the premium thing. And I feel like there is too many features locked for premium that I can't do anything.",
            "I love this app. My favourite thing is that it gives you a routine based on your mood. Its great for if you feel a bit down too and you can see your progress in happiness. In July I had saved mine as \"stressed because of school\" and now I'm happier than ever! Defo recommend 5☆ from me!",
            "Reflectly is such a great app! You can add multiple moods and activities for each day, there are also quotes, you can choose what quote style you want for different things you are struggling with or things you just need to hear. I highly recommend this app!",
            "Really terrible experience. I applied for account.paid 1 months fee, completed stupid tutorial and before email creation hit back. Because I don't want to create this account. And now I'm stuck on trial account, but I lost 1 months fee. I'm totally disappointed. Stupid tutorial, stupid app, stupid idea! Return my money!!!",
            "I know this app is good because my friend showed me it and after time he was feeling great thanks to this so i wanted to try too, but before i could create my account it didnt let me tick the TERMS OF PRIVACY box and i wish that you could fix it please. But otherwise this app is great according to my friend."

            "It's great the annoying thing is that you need a premium access to your spotify to listen to music (I cant afford premium access) if you could change this that'll be lovely!!!",
            "My daughter has been using this app for a while when she out grew the more kiddy ones. We download some songs from our librarie's fregal subscription. However they cancelled the subscription and we got bored with our selections, so I finally upgraded my Spotify subscription. However I can only seem to open one playlist to use? I don't get a choice. Am I doing something wrong? Is this normal? We also can't pick a specific song? I'm not as concerned about that though.",
            "I loved the app the couple times I've used it. The way the timer works is wonderful and so is being able to play my own music. However the big reason I downloaded this app is because I struggle to remember to brush my teeth and I wanted the notification to remind me. I turned the notification on and made sure I could get notifications from the app in my phone settings as well but I do not get the notifications unless I remember to open the app at the times I set it for.",
            "Great app for teenagers! My 13 and 15 yo will actually use it bc it's not an app for little kids, so it's wonderful!! They like the music options too. Suggestion for future: I'd really like it if I could see the days I brush on a calendar. Then even get my whole family involved, and have a healthy competition going with the kids on who brushed more that week! But I know you're actively working on it and so far so good. Keep it up!",
            "Great! I've never been more consistent about brushing my teeth. The only suggestion is notifications should have varying levels of annoyance if you need more motivation! Like one that is more of an alarm than a reminder. It would also be nice to access another music app like pandora or YouTube music if you don't have Spotify premium. But otherwise, great app and great concept. I love the ragtime song :) Thank you!!"

            "Takes time to get used to it. Biggest thing I have a problem with is in the watch itself, so it's irrelevant here. Also, auto syncing is a myth. It tries really hard but it won't sync unless you physically push the refresh button. It can be confusing at first though because it looks like it's already refreshing most of the time, (it's not). Keep in mind though that your watch and the apps usefulness is dependent upon your level of android and mine is (almost) 2 years old. Good for the $$$.",
            "It works real good don't regret getting it. It doesn't connect to WW (weight watchers) I have to put steps in myself. Only complaint I have is Walmart employee said can get new band on line and that's not true. I've had others check also. My band is blue and it gets dirty and it won't come of at all. So one of these days will have to get another watch. That's only thing I was disappointed in. Why only 4 stars.",
            "Updated the app and now I can't log into the app, can't even reset the watch, because to do that, I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOG INTO THE APP!!! *Will update review if I hear from them and/or fix the issue* **UPDATE** RESOLVED THE ISSUE FINALLY.. HAD TO UNINSTALL THE APP, POWER CYCLE MY PHONE, REINSTALL THE APP, THEN POWER CYCLE MY PHONE again!!! (I like the tracker to keep an idea as to how many steps I take every day and to monitor my sleep...)",
            "Disappointing... sometimes just doesn't work, it just stop... and is NOT precise at all, is like a pedometer/watch; no more than that... NO. Publicity shows a LOT more but when you use it it dosen't have even half of publicity or even the box says. It was a extremely disappointing, bought it on sunday and I'll return it today (Tuesday).",
            "The watch works great but the sync up with phone doesn't work. It always gets disconnected and it's really frustrating. If we reset the connection all the history is wiped out. The main reason is to track activity but if the history is wiped out its do very frustrating and of no use."

You will learn mindfulness techniques, find ways to become calm, cultivate gratitude, and experience deep relaxation.\r\n\r\nThe app is divided into 3 parts to help you take care of your mind:\r\n\r\n- Meditate: To cultivate lasting peace of mind\r\n- Music: To escape from the everyday grind\r\n- Sleep: To get rest & preserve one's sanity\r\n\r\nEach of these sections is there to help you. The purpose of this app is to help you sleep better, experience deeper relaxation, and enjoy life a bit more. Simply open the app, select your meditation theme and press play. Simply sit back, relax, and breathe in the tranquility.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t worry if you have never meditated before. Each meditation is a guided meditation, one that will talk you through each and every step. There are meditations of shorter duration for beginners, as well as longer duration sessions for seasoned meditators looking for a challenge.\r\n\r\nGuided Meditations\r\nThere are 10 distinct meditation suites:\r\n\r\n- Breathing Meditations\r\n- Mindfulness Relaxation\r\n- Muscle Relaxation\r\n- Traditional Meditation\r\n- Mindfulness Meditation\r\n- 10 Minute Meditation\r\n- Meditation for Beginners\r\n- Workplace Meditation\r\n- Visualization Meditation\r\n- Stress & Anxiety Meditation\r\n\r\nCalming Music & Nature Sounds\r\nPut some headphones on, and disappear into a world of environments, or take a quick nap induced by ambient melodies and extremely relaxing music.

But practice makes perfect. A timer helps keep track of time so you don't have to think about it. All timers can be customized by you to have a starting bell, background music, and an ending bell. In the end, the time you meditated for will be added to your progress statistic.\r\n\r\n-Open Ended Timer: Meditate for as long as you wish while the app keeps time. A subtle gong marks the beginning of a session. You may also choose to have the gong sound at intervals, to keep your mind present, and in-the-moment.",

            "Frustrating. At first I was impressed with the 30 day meditation course. Was slightly annoyed the payment screen shows every time I open the app but as there's plenty of free content it was ok. I wondered if I might even pay for the premium version once I'd done all the free stuff. Then today I checked in for day 8, saw the message saying they had today's meditation ready for me and then discovered it was locked. This made me feel duped and now I don't want to give them my money. Sad. 😑",
            "Was really good for free meditations although the sleep meditations could be a little longer and had nice reminders but unfortunately thinking about uninstalling as they now want you to sign in and agree to their terms. Lots of stuff is locked. How about an option not to sign up? What a disappointment-people need easier access to this type of app, not more difficult! I had been considering a purchase but don't think I'll be doing that now as there are other easier to access apps out there.",
            "This app has changed my life. I took up meditation around 4 months ago, but only really started using daily 34 days ago( it keeps track for you). It also tells you how many minutes you've put in, and rewards you with badges for completing milestones. There are lots of courses to complete also a 30 day beginners introduction of short (around 10 mins) meditations to help you start the correct way. This really helps with my bad moods. Thanks Deep Meditate.🙏",
            "It's a fabulous app. But they have slowly started to lock 90% of the meditations unless you pay for premium. I highly dislike that.",
            "A lovely app to have! Has a lot of meditations for any emotion that you are going through. I overthink a lot and this app reminds me to live in the present either through meditation or the words of encouragement they notify you with. Highly recommend!"

However, for most of us, routines fill the largest part of our daily life and those are often overlooked in diaries. \r\n\r\nTo capture all parts of your life that matter Mood Patterns uses a technique of the social sciences: ecological momentary assessment also known as experience sampling. It never asks you to remember anything but records how you feel right at the moment. \r\nYou are unique\r\nWhere we go, who we meet, and what we do is individual. With Mood Patterns, you do not have to choose from a fixed set of categories but can tailor your options to your personal needs. Be as nuanced as you like in configuring places, people, and activities.\r\nYour data is yours\r\nHow you feel is sensitive private data. We believe it should not be carelessly entrusted to anybody. Mood Patterns  does not request Internet permission, therefore no data transfer in the background without your knowledge is possible. Mood Patterns will not send us or anybody else your data.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, we believe that you should have full access to the data you produce. You can export all collected data as a SQL database anytime you like.\r\nYour data is safe\r\nDenying Mood Patterns Internet access frees you from the need to trust us, but what about others? An app lock assures that only you can use your Mood Patterns app. To prevent that the app lock is bypassed  by connecting your mobile phone to a PC all data is 256-bit AES encrypted.

            "It's simple and cool. Autoprompting is my fav part Dev: Is there a way to customize the things that are surveyed? I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

            "Nice app. Very useful. My one more suggestion is please add some sound (male/female/binaural) for Hold. Sure it will help more. Thank you so much developer team. Sure I will suggest to my friends😊🙏❤️",
            "the only good breathing app. excellent, easy to use, intuitive. very powerful.",
            "Works very well for HRV biofeedback paced breathing. Simple and easy and the visual and sound cues are crisp and make it easy to know exactly when to start and stop each inhale, exhale and pause. The only issue is the blue color which can interfere with sleep. A warmer color scheme would also be easier on the eyes at night.",
            "The app is Nice but no update in 5 years??!!!!! And why can't I download some breathing profiles/schemes? For example some pranayama or some holotropic breathing. Maybe some other sound available? What if I want to rename a breathing profile for save it when I change smartphone? Nothing! I mean it's still a valid app but no one behind it. No updates no improvements. I'll change my review as soon as the developer want to show up./ I purchased the app like 4 years ago, I paid for pro version and I didn't see any improvement. Unfortunately.",
            "Great app. One of the best I've tried. I rely on the vibrate feature. (The voices and sounds are otherwise very distracting). The vibrate is not working on my pixel 2 xl anymore. Not sure if it was an update from you or something else but without the vibrate feature working I can't really use it anymore."

            "I think there are better apps out there. You have to pay extra for any insights. And it's rubbish at analysing the data adequately. I keep getting a higher temp before LH surge, but not the significant rise of post ovulation. But instead of taking this into account and using all the data it just ignores LH results and gives a wrong date for ovulation. It ignores the fact it is impossible to have LH surge After ovulation has occurred.",
            "Great free app, been using for one year now since I ditched the pill. have avoided pregnancy thus far by using app to better understand my cycle.",
            "It's got potential but as period tracking app you think it'd be able to do the most basic function of tracking you period. This is literally the 1 & only tracking app I've used that does not let you change how long you bleed. It will only use whatever you put when you 1st sign up. I emailed the developers & the response showed they don't even know the difference cycle length & period length which is pretty concerning seeing as their product is about women's period cycles.",
            "I love to track my cycle and thereby understanding how my body works.. I'm using it in combination with the thermometer. I have a few things which should be improved:. 1) I want to add notes to my sleep patterns and to my diet details, 2) please add surfing and Hiit workouts as an exercise option 😁",
            "The intelligent recognition is so wonky. It doesn't load the photos from my camera roll consistently, nor recognize the lines on my OPK consistently either. The layout is ok. The functionality is ok. The fact you have to pay for certain information that is free on many other apps is not within my liking."

I only wish that this app would track your weight and do some before and after photos. Or it could definitely make some monthly or weekly progress notifications. Other than that. This app is definitely great. 👍",
            "Totally recommend a subscription. There are SO many workouts to choose from with various levels of strength/endurance. I love that you can see how long the workout is and for many of the programs, you can see what exercises yoy will be doing ahead of time. Includes recipes too. Great value.",
            "Excellent app. I'm not fit and I keep up with every exercises. Many different level options. Entertaining and fun coaches. I recommend it!",
            "This app has great workouts and I have found the coached workouts are easy to follow. The recipes are fairly easy to follow and its improved my breakfast game. The reason it doesn't get five stars is because it's really lacking in personalization. It doesn't help you tract your weight or personalize the meal plan to your height/weight/gender/activity level. As is, the meal plan portion of the app is highly lacking for what you pay for the app. I do really love the workouts though."

Thanks anyway, you tried.",

            "I really love this app and I've been using it to sleep and relax recently! I would love for it to have timers for less minutes like 5, 10, 15 as the current shortest is 30 mins and for it to have an alarm for when the time is over so that it can be used for short naps.",
            "Update: took a while, but Finally sleeping more than a few minutes here and there. The 45 minute sleep meditation helps big time. Having Fibromyalgia makes sleep near impossible. Even when taking a sleeping pill, it doesn't help all the time. Despite the fact that I still don't get much sleep, my body is resting more than before using this app. If I can shut down completely and get a solid 60 minutes of sleep, I'll be raising it up to a full 5 stars (posting this at 1AM EDT)."

            "The app is easy to use, and provides copious workout regimens that can easily be altered to match your personal needs based on exercise comfort level and equipment access. Best geared towards people with a little experience(you should consult a personal trainer if you don't have experience anyways). My only complaint would be that timed exercises like planks can't currently use the same in app timer that is utilized for rest between sets, or at least I haven't figured that one out yet.",
            "5 Stars to 1 Star. I purchased this subscription and have an issue with account recovery. I purchased a new phone and submitted a request to recover my account and there is a 72 hour wait time in which I'm on day 4 with no response. I requested a refund and google notified me that they are unable to provide one. I do not recommend this app for fitness goals or a subscription for the issue above. You lose your phone or get a new one they will not recover your account info.",
            "Overall I like the app and the ease of use. I wish it was easier to change dates for workouts. If you forget to \"finish workout\" it caries all those exercises over to the next day. Also if you are loading your own workout it would be helpful to be able to load them in advance as opposed to the day of the workout.",
            "Good for where it is thus far. Needs same features as iOS. Like that it builds routines for you and that you can add what equip you already have. Needs the ability to say what weights you have, but how many. would also like the ability for the program to show.me what weights I need to add to my bar so I don't have to think. Lastly, need to be able save workouts you've completed for future workouts.",
            "I really like actual 'guts' of the app. Nice selection of exercises. Good video and instructions. It increments the workouts as you go along. The muscle recovery is very handy. The GUI needs work. I would like to be able to see the muscle recovery percentages on the graphic showing the muscles. The android app needs as much love as the IOS. Please provide some integration with Google Fit or Samsung Health. It would also be nice to have a button to regenerate your next workout."

            "My daughter loves this app because she loves trying to get the stars to decorate her 5 rooms. Well, she's earned enough to get every single item in each room, and currently has 81 stars. She is anxious to have more rooms or decorations. I emailed you guys ages ago asking if/when you would be updating, and never received a response. She's been asking me daily for three weeks if I've heard from Budd. I'm giving you only two stars for the lack of response.",
            "All 3 of my kids' accounts are glitching: not giving all stars, not opening new rooms when first 2 are complete, and not even letting my daughter login at all. But brushing and attitude have improved even in the incredibly short time the app worked.",
            "Edit: Seems the devs fixed it Good app but not supported anymore it seems. Email support never answers back so you're stuck. In my case I want to transfer the app to another identical phone (1st one broke). But it doesn't work. I'm even on the paid subscription!!! Otherwise it's a well designed app for kids - mine LOVES it. Annoying to adults but we're not the audience here. The video recording & playback, quizzes, AR, etc.are well thought out and implemented. I just wish they still had support.",
            "My son really enjoys this app. It makes him slow down & pay attention to where & how he's brushing. My son can watch how he's brushing and compare to the character. The app takes pics during the brushing process. After brushing is done the child matches his/her pic with the character. If matched correctly, points are earned to \"purchase\" decorations for their bathroom w/ in the game. My only negative opinion would be not having the child brush their tongue. I REALLY wish they would add that.",
            "A game that teaches good brushing techniques AND rewards a child's efforts! I tried every toothbrushing game out there, and this is the only one that teaches to brush all parts of the teeth and lasts at least the 2 minute recommended brushing time. It's fun and gives rewards at the end. Almost perfect. It needs to include brushing the tongue. It also needs to spend more time on the biting surfaces, as those are the most important to brush."

I've created multiple support tickets and the problems have seemed to have gotten worse. I pay a significant amount of money each month therefore I would expect some type of resolution. I'm greatful for the gym but the main reason I joined was because I could secure a 60 min workout each day. If I cant get",
            "It stays pretty up to date and the app support has been nothing but great. The only thing I wish could happen is if there was a way to have it casted to my tv screen directly. Also, you need to make sure you get your heart rate between blue and green zone during the dynamic warm up to get a real good read on your heart rate otherwise you'll be sweating your ass off and it's still in the gray zone.",
            "Have reach out to my home studio and to the crestor through the app but the same problem exists. After a workout the app will show a summary of my whole workout but a summary of the treadmill activity is not always shown. No one knows why....claims have been made that it was fixed but the issue is still there.",
            "When this app was brand new, I had a lot of issues with it. Now it is fantastic. It's really easy to book and cancel classes, see my stats and even check my progress on challenges. It would be cool to have fitbit integration as well as my fitbit short changes my efforts.",
            "This app is so easy to schedule classes and keep track of my past workouts. I like to go through and see how my heart rate is improving in different classes. I also love that I can keep track of the challenge workouts and benchmarks!"

Only used it for a couple days but seems really good so far. Love the kind of \"social media stories\" layout think it works well apart from it goes back instead of forward quite often when tapping near the middle. Thank you!",
            "Impressive, clarifying and insightful. This app is beautifully designed (not just visually, but also from a user design perspective). It's easy, small little tasks that are done in 2/3 minutes and give you a bit more insight or help you when your head is racing because of... F.e. stress. Give it a try. It's quite unbelievable it's free. I would love to pay a one time sum of money / small donation to use it!",
            "Its been excellent so far. Not invasive, but still gives me incentive to go back to it. I like the way things are paced, and i've surprisingly really enjoyed the journaling feature (something I was pretty sure I was going to use exactly zero times unless forced). All in all just a calm space that i can go to once or twice a day to reflect and try to better myself a bit. Easily recommended.",
            "This app was so wonderful! Compared to other apps which have limited things for free, this app has everything you need for FREE!! It has so many rescue sessions that help me so much! Every 3-4 days there are check-ins, and I definitely don't regret installing this app!! Sometimes the page takes a long time to load. But overall I LOVE this app and definitely reccomend it!!",
            "Just wow... I've used apps making similar claims, usually disappointed in what I experience; ads constantly or gimmicky content locked behind Premium version. Not so with Intellect! It's free and ad free but more than that, it actually does what it claims. This app has and continues to help me immensely and I am going to say the craziest thing but, I'd like to pay for it! It's rare to find such value and I highly recommend Intellect to everyone. We all have things to improve. Thank you so much!"

            "I had this app years ago and it worked really well. Downloaded it last week and it seems to be a lot more troublesome now. When I take a photo the screen freezes for 10 seconds before it acknowledges it. For my diary yesterday (Monday) it is saying it is today (Tuesday) instead. Also some of the days have timestamps of when I ate the meal yet other days show when my reminder is set. The clocks changed at the weekend but the app hasn't aligned with that, as my phone now buzzes at the wrong time.",
            "Good app. Does what I need. But sometimes......usually after about 4 weeks it plays up to the point where I have to uninstall and download again.",
            "Easy to use and supports tracking food without numbers. And by default set up to encourage eating 6x a day, which is great. But the number of ads for premium services is a lot -- I can't ever just log my food without closing an ad. Sometimes meal updates and edits don't reflect in the daily view until later. And now I can't move to the next day without a blocking ad. Please fix these things -- I would happily recommend this app to everybody I know if it weren't for them.",
            "I wish this app worked. It's a great idea. I'm running the latest version of Android on a Pixel phone and the app still has errors. The PDF function doesn't work. When I click the today function it takes me to the wrong day. Super frustrating.",

            "It is mostly convenient to enter data, but I'd like the ability to change the defaults in Settings. For instance, my smart watch measures blood pressure on my left wrist, but the default is \"right arm\". For another, the readings I take in the morning up to early afternoon are all 'Fasting', but the app tries to be helpful by suggesting an event label based on an average person's schedule.",
            "I am pre diabetic and need to regularly measure my blood sugar. I love being able to log my numbers in without having to go through a tedious menu. Its also got an alarm I can pgm to remind myself to do it. Oh, and itll show me if my numbers are \"normal\" or \"too high\". I am sure it must have a \"too low\" category, but my numbers are never that low.",
            "Very easy to use, that's main need. Can be exported but I'd prefer it to be able to be saved or backed up to my Dropbox acct. Notes aspect is confusing since it's not actually separate from the actual things you're tracking. That should be a note feature that doesn't get attached to anything. Also the food is only in grams which I'm not going to use. I will be trying other apps, but if my few needs here we're there, I'd have picked my app by now.",
            "Nice clean interface on a basic record keeping app for diabetics. Not a lot of bells and whistles. I use it for my cat's glucose and insulin. I particularly like the quick entry option by pressing + at the main menu to add a reading. It could use some improvement in terms of managing the list of medications, though. We only use one, but I still have to select it from the list each time. There's probably a file I can edit or something, but it's not spelled out anywhere I've seen.",
            "I've used this app for a number of years now. It is a great way for me to keep a record for my doctors as well as myself. Thank you! At this point, however two-years following my last review, I am a bit frustated. Again I am attempting to share my numbers with my doctor. But this time the app does not provide the BP readings for print or any other modes of transmitting; only blood glucose. I am disappointed right now!"

I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",

Every type of situation and desire can be fulfilled by this app. You can relax, have deep sleep, memorize everything, study focused and deep meditation. Just wow what else can I say. Highlyyyyyyy recommended!! Must install.😇😇",

            "I love this app but i have a few suggestions... first of all, it'd be nice if I'd choose background melody. For example, i need boost my brain in the morning but i don't like the Beta Wave melody... very much. plus, the quality of the pics isn't good which is a lil bit annoying too. but it'd be even better if there were a video or gif instead of photo. anyway, your beats don't hurt my poor ears just like other similar apps do. thank you",
            "It Actually Works.. no headaches or loud \"wahh\" sounds. The light music plays well with each beat. If you want a no nonsense, no (my head is going to explode\" and simply beats with music. Yes, You can create your own as well. Its nice and soothing as it should be! 😊"

            "It's a brilliant app, it's great for a beginner. I totally loved it. I'm also using their pushups and 5k running apps. Two weeks left to complete those too and it's great. I never worked out and I came across this app in lockdown and it has helped me so much.",
            "The exercise routines are great. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 starts is due to the ads after completing the workout. Specifically, any time a Quicken Loans ad opens, I'm unable to close the ad (other ads allow you to close after about 5 seconds). I end up having to completely close the app and reopen it, then mark the workout as complete (which sometimes needs to be repeated, if the same ad comes up). Having to do this, especially multiple times, can really throw off my routine.",
            "I love these apps by Zen Labs, but sometime I've already done a warm-up and just want to move onto the sets. If I'm using more than one app (I also have the Sit Ups and Push Ups apps installed), it'd be nice to be able to pause the workout to move between the apps for circuit-style training and not lose the rep counts. Also, a pause option would be nice when I get higher up in reps in case I can only do 2 sets before a meeting, etc. Having a return point would be great.",
            "Started this program 2 weeks ago,. I enjoy it so far. I use this between doing other exercises so it would be great to turn off the warm up period. Hope I make it through the other 6 weeks.",
            "It's a great app, but I have some criticisms: #1: there should be a cool down. #2: there should be longer warm up for more exercises. #3: there should be a longer rest for more exercises. #4: it keeps crashing my phone and making me restart it. #5: it should have reminders for you to do exercises. All in all, it is good!"

Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

            "I have used this app since early pregnancy and it has been such an aid. My baby is now a few months old and I can honestly say that there have been very few days when I haven't opened the app. The availability of advice from the pros and from other mothers is so helpful especially when you're stuck in a rut not knowing what to do/think as a parent/parent-to-be. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. I'd be lost without it. Well done to the creators.",
            "This app is Brilliant! I have been suffering from morning sickness for 10 weeks now. Forever being sick. Especially in the morning! Then I downloaded this app and had a good look! It has gave me advice i haven't found else where and for the first day. I haven't been sick! I am so grateful for this app. Its videos for every week are to die for 🥰😍",
            "So I do really really like this App for get me wrong, the only thing that I feel is missing is a symptom tracker, and appointment reminders. Things that I did see other apps offer but I personally did not like the community in those apps as much as this one. So for that I give 4 stars if there as an update later on I will gladly change my review to 5 stars and will happily promote this app to my trying friends.",
            "Love this app, it has so much info to offer and it's so helpful. I'll even google questions and the answer will sometimes pop up in this app which is really beneficial. It has a great support system as well to help you along you journey. It shows you week by week how your baby is growing and just so much information I highly recommend!",
            "This is my favourite pregnancy tracker. It's like watching baby grow week to week. You can connect with other expectant moms. There are lots of helpful tips and articles on diet, relationships, and more. I have recommended it to my friends."

My morning routine has changed from Wake up - Brush - coffee to Wake up - Brush - Omvana - coffee :) The experience is absolutely spectacular...I strongly recommend to download this wonderful app. Thank you Vishen :)",
            "Overall I enjoy this app. The content is great and the underlaying additional deep tones under the meditations are nice. Having said that: I am going to have to start taking stars away. Several bugs have become more and more noticable, prominent, and now: down right annoying. Meditations are consistently stopping mid way. Program utilized and or paid for are constantly disappearing from my library. The undertones also randomly stop. Really doesn't look good for a $70/yr app.",
            "Access to my favorite courses/files fails very often. Playback is stopping in the middle of meditations even if the app has no system restrictions to use power or whatever. The app is updated to the latest versions always. Some sound files are with disturbing backround noises ... like recorded in a office, kitchen or where ever. I would love to use this app but this renders the app useless.",
            "This app is so great, and thank god, there's lots of free learning, meditations of various lengths and complexity, and choice of wonderful collection of background ambient sounds, or silence. Thanks so much Vishen for making all of this available. I especially love the 6 Phase Meditation 💜🙏💜🦋",
            "Great app with so many different classes and meditations. Love that we can filter them. However, the circle makes it difficult to move back and or forth when it comes to lessons. Maybe having a button to press to go back 10 seconds?"

            "Found a pamphlet with this app on it as a PTSD resource at my VA behavioral health clinic nearly a year ago. Checking it out was the best decision (other than treatment) I've made. It provides the ability to schedule regular check-ins with tracking over time and various tools and learning resources for the individual, their family, and their support network. I'm grateful for this app everyday for helping manage my symptoms and maintain regular check ins between psych/therapy appointments.",
            "This app has really good tools to help you deal with trauma symptoms, like guided mediatations, body awareness, and soothing sounds.",
            "I like that I can customize it like the soothing images I can change. What I find calming and soothing is not the normal of most.",
            "A great tool for those who have anxiety. The guided meditations are a great help. I highly recommend this application. I have already made a recommendation within our group. This is a must have tool for any PFA toolbox.",
            "I like that there are so many different types of activities to try out and see what works. Then I can favorite the ones that really help. Also, it's free and doesn't collect personal data!"

            "I really like the app! The sounds are nice and I like both the male and female voices, which is rare for me. Being able to set a wake-up timer is nice and isn't something I've seen in many other \"sleep noise\" apps. The app is visually a little rough around the edges, but the functionality is totally there. Also, cust. service is LOVELY. Prompt response and they were able to help me out with subscription stuff. I would totally recommend for the price; much cheaper per mo. than Headspace or Calm.",
            "Good app. Great app... The study section is no doubt the best in the game. I could forget everything else but my studies by just listening (headphones or no headphones). The nap section leaves you feeling well rested and ready to continue with your day. The sleep section is great, but I guess I've been using this app for a long time. This used to put me to bed within minutes of getting to bed. I guess I got too used used to what plays and the narrations. It has a hefty price though💔",
            "Love this program! It's really help me sleep. It's has a lot of options, different dream scapes, male or female voices, so I don't get bored. It is simple to use for those late nights of unrest. I've learned a lot about relaxing, and I love waking up to the quotes. They are great.",
            "When I set it to wake me up, I need to set at least one other alarm because that feature rarely works. Like... Sometimes it just doesn't work at all and I don't know how that could be possible. Sometimes it crashes in the middle of the night. It's frustrating because you pay 40 plus dollars for something and it doesn't work reliably. They are smart to get their money up front. Probably wouldn't recommend.",
            "I love the app,i used the free version for about 1 year and it helped me tremendously, its great so i decided that i will purchase the full version for 1 year when i relocated to the UAE in February, (I purchased it around March or April) It worked perfectly until now 5 September I open it up to fall asleep again and now it brings up the screen to pay again for the full version.last night it still worked. This is not even 6 months and my year paid service already inactive. Pls cn support help??"

            "I really like the app! The sounds are nice and I like both the male and female voices, which is rare for me. Being able to set a wake-up timer is nice and isn't something I've seen in many other \"sleep noise\" apps. The app is visually a little rough around the edges, but the functionality is totally there. Also, cust. service is LOVELY. Prompt response and they were able to help me out with subscription stuff. I would totally recommend for the price; much cheaper per mo. than Headspace or Calm.",
            "Good app. Great app... The study section is no doubt the best in the game. I could forget everything else but my studies by just listening (headphones or no headphones). The nap section leaves you feeling well rested and ready to continue with your day. The sleep section is great, but I guess I've been using this app for a long time. This used to put me to bed within minutes of getting to bed. I guess I got too used used to what plays and the narrations. It has a hefty price though💔",
            "Love this program! It's really help me sleep. It's has a lot of options, different dream scapes, male or female voices, so I don't get bored. It is simple to use for those late nights of unrest. I've learned a lot about relaxing, and I love waking up to the quotes. They are great.",
            "When I set it to wake me up, I need to set at least one other alarm because that feature rarely works. Like... Sometimes it just doesn't work at all and I don't know how that could be possible. Sometimes it crashes in the middle of the night. It's frustrating because you pay 40 plus dollars for something and it doesn't work reliably. They are smart to get their money up front. Probably wouldn't recommend.",
            "I love the app,i used the free version for about 1 year and it helped me tremendously, its great so i decided that i will purchase the full version for 1 year when i relocated to the UAE in February, (I purchased it around March or April) It worked perfectly until now 5 September I open it up to fall asleep again and now it brings up the screen to pay again for the full version.last night it still worked. This is not even 6 months and my year paid service already inactive. Pls cn support help??"

I'd slacked on using it for a while, & let me tell you... I was really feeling a lot better about myself & my life when I was consistently making time for this. I need to really shave my budget rn, & intended to cancel the Premium version, but I just used it again this morning, & it offers SO much. If you actually *use* it, I think $10/mo is actually a steal. ❤",

I haven't slept this well in over 2 decades, and I can't remember when I felt this much hope. Thank you so much!",
            "I have a few different categories chosen. When I entered the app today to continue my sessions there was a recommended lesson that wasn't there yesterday or the day before. I'm already listening to 4 different lessons, and the recommended lesson REMOVED a one that I was actually listening to DAILY, causing me to have to search the app for the lesson that was removed. I cant even remove the recommended lesson. If I wanted another lesson, I would search for it myself. I can't save my lessons :/",

            "Very handy app. I use it everyday to track calories and nutrients. Would really, really like to see the option to use NET CARBS as the daily total carbs. That would be very useful to me. Love, love, love the bar-code scanning feature. I think some sort of organizational options for MY FOODS would also be helpful (folders? groups? sorting?) Scrolling through an unordered list of many items is pretty laborious. Overall, it's a very valuable tool to me.",
            "I started using this app on mid March and by mid October, I had lost a total of 13 pounds. It calculates the amount of calories you should consume based on your weight and height. It has a catalogue of foods and exercises with their calories, and it also allows you to add your own. You add the food you've eaten during the day and the exercise done. Certainly, it has been a useful tool during my weight loss efforts.",
            "Love this app! Tracks food, water intake, fitness and so much more. But my favorite feature is that you can scan most products and it will input for you. You can adjust amounts, if necessary. It has a community and other nice features. I am now asking myself why was I paying for a program (starts with a \"n\"). A youtuber (Kimberly Hooks) recommended it to me so now I am recommending it as well.",
            "I've used this app on and off, logging calories or just tracking food. I love it personally because the design is simple and aesthetically pleasing, adding your own foods and nutrition info is easy, and the bar code scanner is convenient for packaged foods.",
            "The only thing I would change is the ability to add foods not in the library with info that I have. Example Dreamfield Pastas I appreciate the correction. Found it, tried it, loved it. Really helping me. It was suggested by my doctor."

This is a great short relaxation, one that I have enjoyed for sometime now and as a massage therapist one I frequently reccomend to my clients. Please fix this problem so myself and others can continue to relax and unwind to this usually fabulous meditation. Many thanks x",

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "I have the light version and didn't find it helpful from the start. The beginner breathing exercise has no speed adjustment and goes too fast from the very first level. There should be a way to slow down the speed of the breathing in and out, it's going too fast from the very start. Very unpleasant for anyone who is trying to learn deep breathing for the first time. Might be suitable for someone who has done breathing exercises before.",
            "I think this is a great app, that helps me destress very nicely.",
            "i like the audio cues for inhale & exhale. agree with other reviews that the breathing exercises could do with a bit more introduction, however, if you have ever done yoga breathing before this week be simple to use. the meditation is also good, a simple \" check in with your body\" approach, but british users will definitely Google at the butTOCK part 🤣",
            "I love simplicity of user interface. 8mins meditation is really very useful,this is what i was looking for. Manny other apps are too complicated to use, some have 1 hour meditation, because of that we lose interest. But here due to 8mins we do it regularly.",

            "I found a sound that I really like. However the app is glitchy. I set the timer for 10 hours so it will run all night, but it randomly stops throughout the night and has to be restarted. Also, if a text or email comes in, it automatically pauses the app and it has to be restarted then, too. It should quiet for notifications, but should come right back on. I almost paid for the premium service, but I am really glad I didn't. I'll be uninstalling as soon as I leave this review.",

            "I would love to give it a five-star. It's a wonderful app. I love the easy access to the videos. The only downfall this app has is if you leave the app in the middle of a workout there's no quick playback feature that I've discovered. This makes it kind of inconvenient if you're in the middle of a workout and you decide to leave the screen for any reason. It would make sense to be able to access the most recent workout on the home screen.",
            "This app is changing my life. I come for the guided meditation and it's honestly the best part of my day. I wish we could archive and have a favourites folder though. It's easy to get distracted by other offerings in the app while trying to find the last pack you were doing. Also, it would be nice to be able to save the pack you are busy with or bookmark recipes so you can access them without Wi-fi or data.",
            "Provides a lot of exercises and meditation activities as well as healthy recipes. I am pleasantly surprised that the app, and all that it offers, is free. Edit: just wanted to say that I wish there was a feature where you could immediately go to pack/activity that you were using on the homepage instead of having to navigate through the menus to find the next activity for the pack. Other than that, the app is awesome.",
            "Surprisingly good, full of content app. So far used meditation only; the naration, content of words is perfect. Sessions are a touch short, but I guess it is an introduction. Needs improvement: 1. Finding OWN overall reports is cumbersome. Would have been auwsum to have a Reports 'button'. 2. Scheduling reminders is only possible once a day. 3. Synchronization with Google Fitness would have been auwsum. Thank You 🙏🏻",
            "Dont know how this is all fre! From what i can tell there isnt even like a premium sub that you have to get to get extras like live workouts, unlimited saves or anything else. Im just blown away how good this app is and it's just as good as my EOS classes! You get everything and it's such an awesome layout. I dont usually write reviews, but dang this is almost to good to be true!!!!!!"

The only issue I've run into is that when I try to post a forum, it tells me I haven't created an account even when I just logged in. Not sure if it's a problem on my end or theirs",
            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

            "I had the old app when I was on maternity leave with my first child and it was great. Unfortunately the new app is really clunky,, it freezes constantly, takes ages to update any changes to the weekly menu and has the wrong amount of ingredients for serving size. It will say 1 serve but then the amount of ingredients will be for 4 serves. I have to up the amount of serves then decrease it again to get the right info. It's just a really buggy app but has the potential to be great.",
            "Needs a bit more work. freezes, records workouts then they disappear from your daily records other times after the work out it doesn't come up to record your workout. A little frustrating at times to keep an accurate record. Recording food is a little behind, would be nice if it remembers your food from previous to record quicker and don't have to type each day",
            "Was a great app, just a few issues now, have to log in everytime I go on it, now everytime I do log in it won't let me log any water or food until I have clicked on the diamond rewards blinking thing, i have read it all once, I shouldn't have to go into it every time before logging anything, also my fitbit keeps un-sincing from the app now..",
            "Well I have only being using this healthy mummy app for about 3 days and I am loving it so is my partner we didn't really no something could be so easy and simple to use and follow the healthy mummy recipes and all the information you get on the side is amazing there's been a lot of work put into this and you can see it I would give it a rating at 100 stars if there was any and this app just makes it so much more easier because you can save your favorite recipes to. Thanks healthy mummy.",
            "It is awesome for the recipe ideas which is mainly what I got it for, but it logs me out often and my previous tracking and \"diamond awards\" resets back to zero and it can't be a bit discouraging seeing everything reset. If you want this for Recipe ideas I recommend getting it but definitely has some bugs to work out"

            "Day 4 and loving this app!! I love that I can listen to my own music while using the workout. The workouts are spot on! I'm sure it's just because I just started, my only suggestion wouldukd be to show a quick animation between moves, or que as to what is next. Sometimes I am scrambling to quickly move into the next one. I imagine as I keep going I'll just know what each move is though. So awesome!!",
            "I love Jillian, she pushes you while motivating you. This app is great, it has a ton of variety and you can modify to whatever equipment you have and for your fitness level. With that being said, I only gave 3 stars because the app is glitchy. For something I have to pay for, I'm disappointed that so many things don't work well. I'm leaving this review today because I just finished a workout in which majority of the videos didn't work so I didn't exactly know what to do. Please fix this.",
            "There have been a few issues with the app, but the support always replies fast and is working on solving them and improving the performance. Thank you! Great app. So many programs to choose from, the exercises are so good and excellent advice about food and healthy diet with many recipes. I would highly recommend. This app is a life changer.",
            "I love the variety this app offers and I'm a fan of Jillian's style of workouts. I've knocked off a star for a few reasons, though. There are glitches, including one I encounter at least once a week in which I skip to the last cooldown exercise and it resets the whole workout like I never did it. That is very frustrating. Even more annoying is that now the volume of my music changes during the workout. I found this distracting and I could barely hear it most of the time, then it becomes loud.",
            "Love the app, have been using is for 4 mos now! I like the different exercise options and meal plans. It is nice that there are beginner option exercises, too. I love the new beginner yoga! There is also a calendar to track your progress. There have been a few random days where the app freezes and gets glitchy but overall I think its a good, useful app!"

            "Good stuff. Great for someone who enjoys using minimal equipment while keeping the intensity high. I like how each workout is multiple parts (1.5m cardio followed by lifting circuit followed by abs, etc). I usually have to abbreviate the workouts down to 2 to 3 rounds for length, but I prefer having to cut a workout down rather than crummy 20 minute workouts that don't do much for me. In my opinion, one of the most comprehensive, thorough, FREE workout apps out there.",
            "This is a great app and a great program. I'm probably in the best shape of my life right now. You give yourself a Marine PFT at week 6, 8, and 10. At 42 I scored better than all of the PFTs I took ,except one, when I was in the Marine Corps in my teens and early 20s. But with that one exception I still barely squeezed out 20 dead hang pullups. I did 26 yesterday.",

            "I find this app to be one of the best exercise regiments I have ever seem. It's a gray way to get in shape, simply because of its versatility. If you can make this work for you & stick with it, you will not be sorry. -D",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I love this idea and have been using this app for years but the app is broken and I'm done wasting time messing with it. I just ran 4 miles and it will only log it as .3 miles. If the app is not open, AND on top of all other apps it will not track your distance. I have all the permissions and settings fixed I've checked so many times. How about donate some of the money to your tech so it is user friendly! Uninstall. I'll be looking for a paid version of this that donates a dollar a month.",
            "This might be the worst app I've ever used. The purpose would be great if it worked consistently. Freezes constantly. GPS tracking is way off. Sometimes it gives more mileage, and others it registers nothing at all. Also claims to have Strava integration but that doesn't seem to work at all after trying 100 times to troubleshoot it with their service team. Massive improvements needed for Android application.",
            "OCT 2020 UPDATE: Still buggy & problematic; uninstalling. \"Woof Trax\" app is a better fit for me. JAN 2020 UPDATE: I've had this app for years & definitely love & appreciate the link between fitness & chartible giving. But the last update in Dec has been problematic. For example: after multiple walks per day (I have a very active dog), app fails to consistently log/update daily miles, my \"streak\" always remains at \"0 Days,\" and continually fails to link w/the \"Walgreens/Bal. Rewards\" app.",
            "It's ok. Unable to view all ur donors though. Very frustrating! And when u try to link it to another app for rewards, ex: Walgreen's balance rewards, it says connected and linked, but then u go on Walgreen's, and it's not! Also very frustrating... and disappointing!!",
            "I really want this to be a great app but I continue to have issues with tracking. It's accuracy is off if it even continues to track after minimizing the app to answer a text or something. I've reached out before to the developer and haven't gotten feedback to questions."

Breathing exercises helps in maintaining the fitness of our body by increasing the blood circulation in the entire body by opening the blocked channels of our body.\r\n\r\nEvery part of our body is affected by breathing. Breathing oxygenates our body, revitalize the organs and plays the substantial role in maintaining our body fitness.

In our busy lives we often don't think of the minimum water requirement in our body which results in dehydration and make our body water deficient. One must take a minimum quantity of water required according to body weight and height. Our app includes the water module also. It gives the notification to drink water at regular intervals so that our body doesn't face water deficiency.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to welcome you here :)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also follow us on\r\n\r\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/7pranayama\r\n\r\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/7pranayama",

            "Really very nice app.Just one change I would like to suggest if you can do.when we do Pranayam,we have to inhale and exhale from different nostrils.In our app it speaks only inhale and exhale. Just edit right or left, though it's written but while doing Pranayam ,can't see in mobile.So please do needful.Overall this is the BEST app for doing Pranayam.I suggest everyone who wants to do Pranayam at home must download this app.Thanks for making this app.",

A NEGATIVE: Even when following manufacturers directions in relation to shutting the monitor off, the Qardio BP drains an exorbitant amount of battery power. The only way I can get a reasonable amount of battery life, is to remove batteries after each use...a bummer! I personally do not use it for anything else.",
            "Qardio is a great app for measuring your blood pressure. It is very easy-to-use and simple to use. The cuff will accommodate 14.6\" bicep. I am replacing a 10 year old omron. I like the way the app installs on your phone and the blood pressure readings appear in the app on your phone. I highly recommend the Qardio blood pressure monitor.",
            "Quick and easy to use. Matches the BP at my providers office, too. 1/29/20 - This device is still working well. It us easy to pack when traveling. 6/7/20 - frequently loses sync w/ Samsung Health requiring manual BP entry. 10/7/20 - it hasn't sync'd w/ Samsung Health for several months.",

There have been times when my b/p has been extremely high & yes extremely low letting my doctor view what's going on with my health.

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "Really really good app covers all the bases and is tailorable to your needs. The only reason it has 4 stars not five is that there is not sufficient explanation of the exercises. Would deffo get a five if that was provided As an idea for improvement it might be nice to add some gentle music in the background while stretching.",

            "It works for the right age. My 4 year old is engaged in the story telling and falls asleep every time. The app is so successful, she is onto it and knows and refuses to watch sometimes. My 2.5 yo is too young to pay attention long term, but the stories do settle him down. My only complaint, really recommendation is for the app developers to offer a search option. The 2.5 yo only wants to watch the train one. And sometimes 4yo wants kitties. We are paying good money, please add thanks!",
            "This is one of the best apps. I would always be ripping my hair out at bed time for my kids and now its so easy for them to get to pick there bed time song or even story.",
            "Too costly, no monthly subscription. I love the concept, love the stories. The visuals are great, and the music that goes with each story is so soothing. However, $60/yr is too expensive for a lullaby/story app. On top of the high cost there is only a yearly subscription. The price needs to be lowered and the subscription needs more options. I feel like the cost is on the road if price gouging. The developers/ marketers know that parents are desperate for easy going sleep routines right now. 😔",
            "I love this app, which is why after my weeks free I decided to buy the app! It works so well with all of my children ages 10, 7, 4 and 2 years. We take the little 2 to bed (they share a room) we put on twinkly lights and connect the tablet up to a Bluetooth speaker and the play Moshi, we have it playing a playlist all night for them. It's helped get them into going to sleep in their own beds rather than on the sofa whenever they pass out or in my bed. So I am extremely grateful for this app."

            "Before I started using Waking Up, I had a half-hearted meditation practice with a self-timer, which was mostly just me being lost in thought for 10-20 minutes. I was a bit elitist about this practice as well, thinking that 'true mindfulness' is not compatible with listening to someone speak. Waking Up has not only improved my meditation practice, by showing me what it actually means to be mindful, but has also changed my daily experience and made me aware of many of my thought processes.",
            "I liked it in its infancy, but the more it develops there really is a great deal to treasure here. Lots of variety. The learning included, by way of lessons and conversations, is great to reinforce practice, and it's additionally marvelous that a number of those participating in Sam's podcast conversations have contributed meditation programs for the app. Liked it in its infancy, but have come to love it. A new program added this week... On the up and up!",
            "I just took the first session and I am already glad that I started using this. Maybe its the way Sam speaks in the calm soothing voice of his, but I already feel a bit relaxed, and for some reason I feel connected to him, like maybe he knows me... Haha.. Don't know if that makes sense... I'm looking forward to learning more about my mind. :)",
            "I really like the content of this app but I would have expected a paid app of this price to be better programmed. For example, it doesn't auto pause if you also have Google maps directions on the go, so Google maps speaks over it. This makes it difficult to listen to any of the podcasts or discussions whilst driving which is what I wanted to do. Could you fix this please?",
            "I just love this app. It's the best introduction to meditation out there and takes you through the stages of meditation and mindfulness in a scientific manner. Sam harris has also included talks and sessions with many other thinkers in the area so you can explore the kind of philosophy that works best for you, that keeps you keeping on with this practise. They keep adding new methods and information and features so it's worth the subscription fee. Go for it."

            "It is really simple to use and let's you add all the info you want to. Which most apps don't. However, one thing that is a bit Irish is the drinks and snack sections. Seeing as the snack section has the water and coffee in it, And that's it!!! (No squash, juice, tea...) I presume the drinks section is for alcohol?!? It doesn't really make sense. Either the snack section is for snacks and the drink section for drinks or add a drink tick chart in each section. With breakfast, lunch, dinner...",
            "Simple entry food diary, not for tracking calories. Good for people who eat out and have drinks and want to keep track of those things. I like it just for the purpose of remembering what I consume and being able to look back on the day to reflect on what I need to add to or omit from my diet.",
            "Great app if you want something very simple and clean to log your meals on. No calorie counting. No portions to enter. No searching a database to find the right food.... just type it in and go. Its exactly what I needed to help me log and commit my meals for bright line eating on the go.",
            "Nice and simple... I usually make mine into bullets for easier review (simple enough to do oneself), but I'd love if there were a way to either review or download each day of logs. The app works perfectly for my purposes right now, but if working with a nutritionist or something, being able to send the info for a day, a week, etc would be a huge assist, even if it were just some kind of full-day review screen that I could screen shot. Otherwise, no complaints, aside from the annoying adds😉",
            "I love it! It's so simple. Other apps count down your calories and that makes for anxiety. This just allows you to write anything you want in the notes field. Some days I track veggies, others calories, still others protein. It's so simple and this, so versatile."

I really like I can choose the length of the meditation. Shorter one if I'm busy, longer one if flexible with my time. Thank you. Ps: but I really like one particular meditation Surrender (I think it's its title) but it's unavailable now. I needed to uninstall and download the app again and that particular meditation is gone.",
            "I love this app! I've tried other a lot of other meditation apps and they don't have the same grounding affect as this one does! When I first tried this app, I did the \"Dream Meditation\" and then the \"Wash Away Your Pain.\" I think just doing those two, while fully immersed, stimulated a lot that I had repressed throughout my life and wasn't expressing, as I had a very bizzare,Vivid, Nightmare,ButIWasSleepingTheBestIEverHave! IThinkUsingThisAppWillHelpRenewMyselfAsAPersonToTrulyWorkThruMyTroubles",
            "This app has helped me to envision my thoughts, awaken spiritual potential and most importantly taught me how to spend time with my self. I started as a complete beginner and the progress is definitely visible. I've also tried many other mediation apps but the voice coaches in let's meditate suit me the best. This app is is a definite go-to for anyone looking to start in the field of meditation or a veteran. Namaste ;)",
            "Just what I was looking for, simple to use, great selections and works amazingly well! Never had any problems using the app and I just love it! Although there are more female voice then male voice which I hope in the future of this app to have more male voice just because of the soothing softer voice they have then a female voice. But overall a really great app, please give it a try!"

Also can add collaborators to read or add info to crate this awesome experience! Online baby photo book that backs up. Baby 101 info or searchable reading info that shows the source info so you can be assured that it's reliable stuff. Also baby quizzes so you can test your knowledge. Total 1 stop shop.",
            "We loved this app for our first child. However, our new baby is 3 weeks old and I have not been able to add my husband as a collaborator, so it's kind of useless until I can. The email that he receives appears to have a link that says \"Accept Invite\". However, it's not clickable. Is there another way for him to accept my invite to be added as a collaborator?",
            "I like the tracking options but I would not suggest this app to anyone. I am a nanny and have 2 babies to take care of. Half the time the app lags or doesn't save my information I put in. It is SOOOO frustrating and a waste of my time away from the babies to literally re-input 1/4 of what I already typed in. I've been using it for 10 months and I'm switching because it gets me so frustrated.",
            "this app initially worked well, but once we had over 1,000 photos for our first child and we added our second child we started having tons of issues. not worth the frustration. we are moving to a different app because of all the issues. I did like the little weekly and monthly informational bites."

My time in range is phenomenally good. It's as if I was blind before, but now have glasses to see. I love this app! And I am feeling so much better because my glucose control is better. I have energy, can think/concentrate, have lost weight because I'm no longer \"feeding the insulin, and sleep better.",
            "Once again...for as advanced as the G6 is, the app should be compatible with more than just the \"latest\" IPhone. I have Samsung Fold and was sad to find it wasn't compatible. Only 20% of population has an Iphone. The receiver reminds me of a flip phone I had 10 years ago. Please update for MODERN Android phones.",
            "Another crappy app by dexcom with huge design flaws. It takes forever to produce a report and during that time if the app loses focus (if you switch to another app or if your screen turns off) the report production will cancel without warning and without informing you. So you have to wait several minutes while touching the screen every few seconds to make sure your screen doesn't turn off while the app does its thing. This is ridiculous.",
            "Yeah, it helps me to refine and schedule my meal changes, periods of activity, BG insulin corrections and my exercise program by showing BG pattern changes periodically throughout the previous day. Kudos for a reliable, well-considered app for helping the diabetic and his care team in dealing with the challenges of diabetes!",
            "Extremely helpful. A must needed tool to control and figure out best treatment, like what foods trigger my blood sugar. I keep a low sugar / carb diet. I have a difficult situation. I also take ani rejection meds steroids which cause my blood sugar to go up as well without this app I was always guessing now I know exactly how to control my issues when they're high which they are many times I'm able to correct due to my steroids"

            "Great app. I have been a bystander at multiple fatal accidents in my life. This would have better helped me render aid while waiting on the emergency services. Love the gps to local hospitals function. I am new to my area and I learned of several hospitals of which I was unaware.",
            "Love this app. I especially like that the content is viewable offline. Because you never know when you might be in an emergency situation and not have wifi or cellular service. That was a very smart implementation.",
            "The app has gone downhill. Do you have lawyers and politicians involved in writing the contents? Are you afraid of liability to the point where you dilute the content to uselessness? Too many clicks, not enough pictures or examples, to the point of not being practical. The Canadian Red Cross First aid app is SO MUCH better.",
            "This app is great! The only reason for not giving five stars is because I would like to see more in depth information, and I know it's possible, as well as more sanarios added (e.g. electric shock).",
            "I appreciate the fact that you are really serious about optimizing your app and not like other apps being \"optimized every week\" and barely anything being noticed about the optimization, so I'm really happy about everything you are doing guys and so good job ❤️"

I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",

People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to.

Your participation will also help improve measurement of blood pressure through smartphones and wearables. In addition, during the study you will receive insights into when and how much you experience different levels of stress, information about your sleeping patterns, well-being, and how your body responds during stress.\r\n\r\nWhat’s new in 2.0?In addition to new daily questions and improved blood pressure measurement, the newest version of the My BP Lab app offers three major innovations:\r\n\r\nGame-Like Cognitive Tasks\r\nMy BP Lab 2.0 turns brain training around by measuring your memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility with game-like challenges. Why? We want to examine how stress and daily experiences influence cognitive capacity from one moment to the next.\r\n\r\nStress Management Training\r\nFeeling stressed and overwhelmed? My BP Lab 2.0 offers stress management training. By opting into the stress management module, you’ll be able to see short videos that teach you skills to help reduce stress and blood pressure. \r\n\r\nGalaxy Watch Active Integration\r\nWith My BP Lab 2.0, you can connect your Galaxy Watch Active to the app and measure your blood pressure straight from your smartwatch in just a few quick touches.\r\n\r\nFAQI'm having difficulty getting a good blood pressure reading. How do I improve the signal?First, check the positioning of your hand. The error may be due to excessive movement. In order to minimize movement, place a pillow under your hand and wrist so that they are fully supported at a 45 degree angle. Additionally, avoid talking, crossing your legs, or taking deep breaths while taking the blood pressure recording.\r\n\r\nTry moving the sensor higher on your finger so that the sensor is resting closer to the tip of your finger rather than the pad of your finger. Make sure your finger is fully covering the light.\r\n\r\nIf you apply pressure to the sensor, it will detect it as movement and you will not get a clear reading. Rest the sensor on your finger and try again.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the room or your hand can affect the quality of the signal. Place your finger in a cup of warm water for 15-30 seconds. Dry your finger thoroughly and try again.\r\n\r\nI only see percentage changes when I take a blood pressure measurement. How do I see my actual blood pressure values?The sensor algorithm needs one initial baseline value from a blood pressure machine as a reference value. Once you enter those reference value numbers then the app will return systolic and diastolic blood pressure numbers. \r\n\r\nIf you do not have any access to a blood pressure machine and do not know you current blood pressure value then the app is still quite useful since you can view the percentage changes in blood pressure over time.\r\n\r\nCan someone else use my phone to measure their blood pressure?Because the app requires you to complete an initial calibration, all of the blood pressure measurements taken through your app will be specific to you. If someone else uses your app to take their blood pressure, the output will not be reflective of that person's blood pressure.",

            "After updating couple times now this app started to work with my new Galaxy Watch 3 as same as the Galaxy Watch Active before. Thanks for the updates and improvements. Sometimes the watch reading failed, I just remove my watch, clean its sensors and my skin it works again also had to stay still and relax . I know this app established in California for blood pressure study so I answer all the questions honestly. I appreciate this app, helps me having a mini monitor on my wrist for my BP anytime.",
            "I want this app to work but it fails to capture blood pressure on Watch 3 consistently. I've got it to work once by lying down but that only works once in a while - like 1 out of 10 tries. What's the trick to get it to work?",
            "Inconsistent ability to measure blood pressure. Takes a while to then upload measurement to app. Disappointed.",
            "Won't work on my A10 (claims no sensor exists during calibration set up), complex to set up. Why no simple bp tracking app?",
            "Won't work on my Note 10. Says no compatible watch found."

I haven't figured out how to do that with this app, so I use MapMyRun for that instead. It also doesn't always let you add your time/distance to a challenge... The option isn't always available, so I manually enter the info.",

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "It's a scam, once you buy the \"program\" then they send you to this app which is exactly like every other basic exercise program Then you have to purchase even more exercise programs because it doesn't include good ones with the initial purchase. After all that BS they try to sell you everything under the sun. THIS IS NOT A MIRACLE DIET, its basic at best and only meant to get your info so they can sell you their supplements. The initial video is completely misleading and flat out a LIE.",
            "Day One I logged into the app after joining and all I got was more cumbersome, videos of Vince trying to talk me into buying more products. I have no ideas how or where to start. This feels like just one innocuous, rambling man who just loves to hear himself talk. I see no directions on what to eat, alternating high carb low carb days for endomorphs etc. So far it is an utter disappointment that has me in tears. I got up early to start and was just bombarded with more long extraenous sales pitches. I will try again but if fat cold be burned by listening to him drone on and on, then I would weight 120 pounds.",
            "This app is great!! Work outs are not intimidating and easy to follow. Great for any level!",
            "The app runs smoothly and navigating between the different programs or contents of each section are great. I can easily track my progress and Vince and the VShred team guide you very thoroughly throughout each workout. The support is also amazing. If I had a question, I was met with a response very quickly. I love this app! The vshred community is also amazing!",
            "Even though the ads were long, the workouts are easy to follow. I purchased the $ 57 Fat loss that came with other packages for free (which otherwise would cost more than $200) You just have to be patient and watch all the information videos before proceeding to check out, otherwise you might miss a good discount. It's a good community and coaches. Yes it cost money, but it's really worth it. If you want free content for workouts or diets, go to YouTube! Be determined!"

            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

            "The content is great, infinit stars for it but would be greate to have a search bar in the app and a section where we can view what we watched and a section with \"continue watching\". Also I have problems too with the last part of the videos and I have the latest version...",

            "I like this app. One thing that would make it better is the ability to set a timer inside it. I don't look at the screen when I breathe with this app. I just listen to the sounds and close my eyes. If I want to breathe for, say, 8 minutes, it would be great if there was a timer I could set in the app that would notify me when I've completed the 8 minutes. Right now, I have to use a separate app for the timer, which is an inelegant solution.",
            "Like the calm interface, the gentle oscillating graphic and particularly like the simple piano tones for breathing. I do wish it had a start button on entering the app. At the moment, as soon as the app opens, it starts. I would prefer to be able to initiate that myself. But still, my preferred app for general breathing exercises. Nice, thank you for the app development.",
            "Would be very helpful to have a timer within the app. Some different sounds would be great too. However! It does what it says on the box. Great app.",
            "Would be better if it included a list of common breathing techniques, and that this app should be open sourced and hosted in F-Droid.",
            "This app needs more recognition, it's easy to use, very customizable, and relaxing. I wish I wouldn't have to set my breathing preferences every time I open the app, but it's one of the best breathing apps by far. Just try it."

Thanks for a straight-from-the-hip, getter-done meditation app. You're welcome. I'm really grateful that the reminders are verbal as well. Most apps seem to think that visual reminders are enough, but blind people don't have the luxury of looking at their phones constantly, so thanks for talking to me.",
            "An excellent, totally free mindfulness app. Smiling Mind covers everything from children to teenagers to adult mindfulness foundations, with a variety of specific targeted mindfulness courses of all sorts to help with different areas like sleep, stress, relationships, work - etc. I've been using it for years and it's wonderfully ad free. As for mindfulness itself, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're curious, Smiling Mind is a perfect place to start.",
            "This app is so great when it works. It gets quite glitchy when it comes to member login and member data. It will not let me reset my password because apparently my email address is not present in the system but I am unable to register a new email address because I'm already registered in the system! When I was still able to login it would randomly delete my data and programs/progress. It will also sometimes just freeze in the middle of a meditation.",
            "I like the meditations however I dont like the layout and navigation of the app. A lot of the meditations are too similar, cant skip and have a long intro that I dont want to hear every time. The app logs me out often too and I have to login, which is an annoying inconvenience when I'm trying to relax to sleep. I fell asleep to it and it kept playing the whole night for 8 hours. And just then I was listening and it kept skipping to the beginning. It was rather creepy actually and now I'm on edge",
            "This app is amazing and has helped me to sleep again. I was relying on a number of medications to sleep but the guided mediations have drastically changed that for me. I cannot thank everyone involved in this enough, so I'm going to donate as well. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful tool freely available and without ads, it really has changed my life 😘"

            "Horrible. I lived in FL for 2 years. I was approved and on medicaid. If you are approved in FL you should be approved in MD too according to the doctors I have spoke with. It gives me a run around and doesnt even ask me about my income so I can tell them I am a part time employee who cannot afford food rent child clothes neccesities and health insurance. Unless you make over 25 an hr idk who can meet that goal. Obviously it just uses old daya and doesnt let you retry the application w new info",

            "I used to use your app to help with my joint pain . But the latest update screwed up the app . It starts out clear but 30 seconds in ir gets scratchy and unusable. I wish you would fix it. You really need to update your app for the galaxy s8 phone. As it,is I can no longer use it !!!! IF IT would work I'd give it a five star rating",
            "The default volume setting is 100% with no option available to change that setting. So when you turn on the sounds, your ears are getting blasted with a dangerous decibel level. Given you're supposed to listen to binaural beats with headphones, this will end up damaging someone's hearing. Immediate uninstall here!",
            "My favorite meditation, music, frequency app. The offerings are the best variety I've seen and I like the customizations you can make to the sound levels in the selfeggio frequency section. You can add in sound elements, like Om, singing bowl strikes, nature sounds and adjust the level of those layers as well. I just purchased the premium and I'm looking forward to exploring everything premium has to offer. Thanks!",
            "Stuttering playback especially on 432 Tibetan, very distracting and unpleasant, after last update it seems to have vastly improved the stuttering, so I have changed my star rating to represent the changes. Some tracks still click and crackle but perhaps that is because my phone. Only problem is that I keep getting notifications to pay for things when I already paid for premium.",
            "I'm not sure what's going on but ever since they did this last update everything is staticky. It don't even have the same effect and it doesn't even sound the same. I don't think that's a good thing considering you have to pay for a membershipand I feel like I'm not getting the most out of that membership now. I might be uninstalling this."

            "I have been using the app for well over a year in conjunction with my Wahoo speed and cadence sensors as well as a heart rate monitor. I bought the sensors and installed the app so that I could do a better job of maintaining a steady speed while leading bicycle club rides that are posted for a given speed. I use Ride With GPS (RWGPS) for navigation and to provide to people who are on the ride with details of the ride plan. Both RWGPS and Wahoo will run at the same time. Up until a couple of weeks ago I would have given the Wahoo app 5 stars. Recently, however, they updated the app with a requirement that it have access to your location EVEN WHEN THE APP IS NOT BEING USED. I can see no legitimate reason for them to know my location when the app is not in use. This is an invasion of my privacy. You have the ability to select access to giving access while the app is in use or denying access altogether. If you select either of these, the app won't work. I am going to quit using the app and rely on RWGPS to link with the Wahoo sensors.",
            "The recent changes to access my location at all times changed my review from five to one star. There is no reason they need this information. Looking for an alternative app. Prior review: Excellent app, works great for biking. Only needs the ability to design your own data screen with the parameters important to you.",
            "It just changed so that it will not work unless the permission is set to allow it to access the location at all times rather than just when the app is running. For both battery drain and privacy reasons this is unacceptable. I'll be looking for a replacement app. I've been using it on my bike. It's OK. One bit annoyance is that \"start workout\" doesn't start the workout, it just changes the mode. To start the workout, after you start workout, you then have to press start. Why don't they just call the button workout mode? It would be nice of the map had a feature where the top of the map was in the direction I was moving. If I'm not heading north and I'm looking for roads off to the side, I have to keep doing mental gymnastics to figure out where to look. My nominal workout is a 7 mile loop around my block. There are several logical way points for comparing segment times, such as the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or a major intersection. It would be nice if it could automatically generate them and give me the choice of selecting them, and then compare my segment times between rides. It would also be nice to be able to overlap speed graphs by position from ride to ride, or just be able to compare ride to ride easily. When I'm riding on paved roads, it knows my altitude from the map, it should use that to correct for mistaken altitude reading from the gps. Similarly it knows my speed and distance traveled from the wheel sensor, it should correct for gps error based on that. It could use averaged GPS data to fine tune the the wheel sensor calibration too. It does give me lap times, though I wish it would auto increment the lap when I get back to my start place, so it's worthwhile for that.",
            "I find this app very helpful because it gives me my RPMs however, I would also like to have distance and yet maybe more useful once I get myself a wahoo chess belt to add distance to the mix. It is still relatively boring to be home working out alone, probably because I'm a spin instructor. Have to amend my review as the app is really difficult to pair with my Ticker Arm heart rate monitor for some reason.",
            "Until now I would have given it 4 or maybe 5 stars. Now it gets zero, but Google Play requires at least one. Suddenly the app mandates location sharing 24/7 to run at all. No, absolutely not, not now, not ever, never. I am canceling my subscription and uninstalling the app. And that is after I have already bought pieces of Wahoo hardware. There are other options. They probably are not as integrated as Wahoo, but they will get the job done that I need to have done. If Wahoo makes location sharing my option and not theirs, I will probably be back. But now, buh-bye, with no regrets on my part. Oh, BTW, a bicycle shop sales rep told me that his store now no longer recommends Wahoo to buyers. Who knows, they may even stop carrying Wahoo products. Way to shoot yourself in the foot, Wahoo."

No option to create a new account, so I guess they don't want new people using their app. Pity too because I heard good things about it, but if they make such a glaring error right off the bat I doubt the app is any good once you get in.",
            "The app is usefull for my galaxy s10 when im training client in person but the website is preferred for building programs. Just tried connecting my tablet to it as well so I could potentially use it rather than my computer when travelling but, the app is terrible on the tablet. Certainly not optimized and doesn't even rotate landscape which I would consider mandatory for any tablet app. Needs much improvement as an app but, great tool for building client programs and tracking nutrition!",

I have been trying to register an account with Mango, but each time I try it gives me an error of \"registration unavailable\" - every time. So 4 stars. I also wish you could add your own habits to the app. Like a custom habit that you could edit, and congifure to fit your needs. I use other apps for habits I can't track in Mango. Would be nice to be able to track it all in one place.",
            "It is great for putting your meds in and keeping track with what you eat. What it does not do is take into consideration not ALL people are glued to their phones to add the information in when it wants it. Yes you can add it in later but does not give you your points. As well as not being linked to other apps like my Samsung watch which keeps track of my steps and this app does not even register 1 step and again does not give me points. How about calories since your tracking food?",
            "This is my go to app to input my health information. It would be nice if it would connect to other apps like Fitbit, Garmin, Onetouch for glucose monitor results so i only have to input in one app and Mango picks it up. Also would be nice if reminders can be adjusted based on weekdays or weekends. I wear my watch to bed to monitor sleep and my watch buzzes at 6am on weekends because I have it programmed for 6am on weekdays.",
            "This app really pushes you to take your medication and other healthy habits of your choice. I've only used this for 2 days now but I already appreciate how helpful it is. I love the leveling system and the rewards you can get the more you stay on track. A+ app in my book. :)",
            "Have not received a reminder notification for the last 4 days. All notifications are turned on and had been working, although it had been messing up randomly prior to last update. Not useful to me anymore without the reminders."

            "This could be a good app because it allows you to keep track of different parameters even in case you do not have Beurer devices capable of connecting to the app. Unfortunately my user experience is bad as I do not find it easy to use, mainly when entering data which is quite slow. You can not directly digit the numbers but you have to scroll until you get the right values, which case could take a lot of time. Update. After some days of use, my account was deleted and I could not recover it.",
            "What happened? This is junk. This morning it would not let me log in for a long time until I could recover my password and now this BF70 will not transcribe my data and all old data is lost. The app looks different and nothing is showing up on screen and the Bluetooth is barely working.",
            "Burdensome synchronization (I am on android). Constant profile hijacking by other family members. Conflicting settings app vs scales (eg. Imperial vs continental measures). I expected different experience. I am sufficiently disappointed to give up any further plans to buy other Beurer devices. I am really sorry. It all looked so promising.",
            "Good app, really nice to have sync between the scale and the app. However that seems to be happening in the apps main thread, which causes it to block until the sync is finished. While the sync is happening, I can't use anything and this is frustrating.",
            "As others have said. Garbage app. Connects 1st time then later on doesn't. Tried everything and just won't connect again via Bluetooth. Defo a problem with the connectivity. Poor very poor."

            "Unusable. It will run for 3 minutes then stop. Unlock the screen and it resumes for another 3 minutes, then stops. All other apps closed before opening this. WiFi turned off. The only app using bluetooth to listen through earbuds. Impossible to use for the intended purpose. Update: seems only to fail on the Study program. ADHD ran the entire preprogrammed time without stopping.",
            "I've had this app for a few years, and the Study & Learning track is very effective in helping me focus at work. HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",
            "For those of you dealing with the app getting killed in the background regardless of your battery optimization settings...try Mindroid. This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",
            "One of the best binaural beats app. It has pre set playlist and you can layer music over it so it's still.playing in the background.",
            "I'm having the same problem as the last 2 reviews where the app binaural sound just turns off when the screen is off :( please fix it soon. Loved this app"

            "Pretty good app. Very convenient and easy to use. One very frustrating thing is that the step counter is inaccurate. I thought it was GPS issues at first, but noticed that if you set your phone down or have to stop (waiting at lights or for traffic) the counter keeps on counting with absolutely no movement. I do like that it connects to the MyFitnessPal app and records miles, calories, and steps there as well.",
            "Mapmywalk WAS good for the most part but sadly no longer. Lame advice from developers (uninstall/reinstall....period! Pfffft!) I can no longer share my hikes via social media, etc with family and friends. All I get is a flash page when I try to share and poof! Gone. Hardly ever use it any longer since last two updates in October 2020. Told you folks to go back to previous version which was reluable. No?! Too bad. AllTrails is my number 1 now. MapMyWalk? A distant number 2.",
            "I love this app. I love how the MMW GPS can track my walk from beginning to end. I love how it tracks everything involved. Time, distance, and the GPS map can allow other to MMW users to view my walk, to actually see the park, or street I am walking on. For free. And they offer so much more for nickles on a dollar. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is serious and their fitness routine.",
            "Very pleased I chose this app as it does all I require well and efficiently at great value. It picks up GPS almost instantly keeps you updated as you go along and provides all the stats I need. The mapping although not shown with pinpoint accuracy is also very good. Could not really ask for a great deal more.",
            "It started as a great app, but as of some time in September, I began to notice that it wasn't giving me credit for my entire mileage. I play Pokémon Go and by doing a task in that game, I found out that I walked 3.8km, which is 2.36mi. On my most recent walk, only 1.82mi were tracked. Yes, the app was open and not paused for this walk."

Once you earn 10,000 points you can redeem it for a cash reward or gift card (incentive) and if you're feeling generous donate it to charity.",
            "First. The step calculator is off by 1000 points if connecting to a Fitbit. For example: I hit 10,000 steps on my fitbit, Achievement only calculates 9000. Two: Achievement is constantly disconnecting from my fitbit and I have to resync everything, at least twice a week, and the sync can take up to 10 minutes. 3. Only logs half my information from my fitbit. I workout everyday and I wear my fitbit everyday, the Achievement log says the last time I was active using my fitbit was 2 weeks ago. 😣😡",
            "This app has been amazing! I love being rewarded for making healthy lifestyle choices! This app encourages me to move more, so I can reach the goal of 10,000 points sooner. I also appreciate all of the research that has been done. I am a member of the healthcare community and have found that all of the information they publish is accurate and reliable! I have recommended this app to all of my friends and family!",
            "I forgot I had the app installed, not sure how long I've had it. I have just been trying to get in shape, exercising, keeping up with my calories and such, and today I saw the app and remember it gives points and I had earned 26k points so I was able to cash out $20 to paypal. Seems great as a passive way to earn money.",
            "Takes forever to get rewards. I have had it synced with my Fitbit and it was with Myfitnesspal. I think I've been using a year and a half and still haven't received the first $10, only at 8400 points of the 10000 required. Not very motivational in my opinion."

            "I still use this app five months on & love it. After the update, it no longer buffers mid-flow & they're so open to feedback (like expanding the library), it's exciting to see what they come up. I pay for premium (works out as just over £5) but when I use it more than Netflix, it's a no-brainer. Need to focus on that assignment, Brain.fm! Want to block out those screaming kids whilst you're trying to relax on your break, Brain.fm! Can't sleep when you're worrying about something, Brain.fm!",
            "I stumbled on this after someone mentioned, in passing, a similar APP on Twitter. After a little research, a flick through the reviews, and sampling trials of other offerings; I decided to subscribe to Brain.FM. It's been a couple of weeks now and I'm honestly surprised at how much this service has impacted me. I have been sleeping better and working more consistently since using the service. I've found this especially helpful given the current circumstances. 10/10 Worth it!",
            "Love it! Definitely notice a difference when working & relaxing. Excited to see this app get even better!!",
            "I originally purchased this app for focus while working. I now use primarily use it for meditation and sleep. FOCUS: It definitely helps when doing heads down work, such as coding, project planning, etc... GUIDED MEDITATION: The guided meditation is okay. I use it on days when I have thoughts running rampant, and need guidance to keep me centered during meditation. I wish they had more variety of those. UNGUIDED MEDITATION: This, to me is the bees knees of the app. The sounds are very immersive, and they just added new meditation sounds (August 2020) that are amazing. SLEEP: Most nights I use the sleep app with headband-style low-profile headphones for side sleeping. It definitely helps me fall asleep quickly, keep my thoughts clear, and eliminates pesky \"ear worm\" songs that constantly play in my head."

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",

So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "This app is nice for the H10 I got, but there are several annoyances. If you go to sessions tab it will try to sync multiple times a second and spam your notifications. If you disable location services, you can get stuck in a loop where it asks you to turn it back on even if it is on. Also frequently get \"this app attempted to get location\" notifications when not using the app. Training options are limited. No way to turn off GPS when I don't want/need it. No customisation for routines.",
            "Misses average HR and pace/speed during training, which is the most interesting data. The voice guidance is also complete garbage and gives only set info which you can't modify in any way. I also don't get the running index for the majority of my runs. Elevation can't be measured with this either hence the nickname polar BAIT: to buy an expensive fitness watch for things you normally get for free. With polar BAIT it isn't even enough to pay 80€ for a HR sensor. Definitely going for Suunto next.",
            "It keeps asking if I want to turn on gps. I do not want to turn on gps for indoor workouts or when just looking for previous workouts. Every click I have to get rid of 2 messages asking me to turn on gps. It is not possible to use the h10 memory function without using gps that drains my battery. What is the point of having a memory function that needs gps? Syncing takes ages, or the whole workout lost. Cannot rename workouts have to put it in the description",
            "Mostly ok ? I have a HRM and want to track my heart rate during swimming and other. This works for outside stuff, but I still am not seeing my HR during a pool swim. UPDATE: AFTER MUTIPLE CALLS WITH POLAR SUPPORT (same type of responses), exchange for new device still no data. So, either product doesn't work for swimming or there is a problem with app and downloads from sensor to phone. Wish they would fix - I saw lots of comments online trying to solve problem. No answers found .👎",
            "I like the app especially the ability to see how much time i spend in each zone. The app sync with Google fit is a little fidgety but that's ok. I do notice it looks for your strap incessantly which is good for connectivity but I worry about the battery life. I wish running had elevation since I trail run and the incline is a large part of analyzing my training"

            "Bloody love this app, and the myzone belt is fantastic. 1 charge on 3 months and still at 68%. It doesn't have the easiest instructions but but the community is great and the social side of the app is brilliant.",
            "Set-up is a little clunky, but once the app is configured, the real-time operation and UI is terrific.",
            "Really love being able to see my heart rate rise when level of activity increases. Helps me work harder. I wish you could stop and start it manually as if left on, it will keep recording till it is taken off. It would be nice to be able to leave it on and record a gym floor workout separately to one done straight after in class. But overall, it's really great to motivate me, especially with the MEP points building to different levels."

            "Easy to book appointments, but some of the repetition asked everytime you book seems to negate the reason for setting up a profile. Saving a Dr and choosing the place shows no times. Doing it the other way around works??? Also Why confirm my appointment by SMS, and tell me to use the app in that SMS if the app can't confirm appointments?",
            "Fantastic GP, however because he likes to take his time with patients is always behind schedule. But we do wait because he has been great for us. Really like this app because it's quick and easy to make appointments and whilst having 4 children is sometimes hard to make phone calls.",
            "Very helpful and gets chance to know understand Hospitals and Doctors... For some doctors full details are not updated. That will helpful if u ensure updated.",
            "Great for making appointments, would good if had more options, ie viewing results; requesting scripts. I used one in NZ that could do all that",
            "Easy to book appointments, particularly with my gp as they have a whole booking system based online. Every time I go in to book I'm logged out of the app, though. Maybe it's because I only use it every few months or more, but it's a bit of a pain having to login every time I'm sick which doesn't happen all that often. Not a big issue, and probably a security thing but would be nice to stay signed"

Great tutorials, great breathing app within the app. I have tried many different meditation techniques over the years. This is by far the best, and the simplest to do. Started cold shower 🚿 exposure and feel great. Thank you Wim. 🙏",

I've been enjoying cold water for years, now I know the specific scientific evidence that tell me why I was naturally attracted to the cold water for healing purposes. The breathing exercises create such a fabulous feeling in my body. I'm so thankful for all Wim Hof is doing, especially today in 2020 and for this app!",

And they are still making the app better, it's like everytime I think of something I wish they would add, the next time I open the app it has been added! I can not recommend this app enough!",

I can log in now and have tried the free excersizes that come with the app. I have already noticed less anxiety, better sleep patterns and more energy and ambition that I thought I had lost during these crazy Covid times where things are so limited and can be unnerving, thinking of the well being of those I cherish."

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

Unfortunately, the weekly graphing facility has gone haywire over the previous few months and the developer does not appear to be able to fix it. The problem appears to be that the app can only manage around about a year of data. Restricting the time frame in the filter to just under a year sorts it out.",

            "Accurate gps. Great for more than cycling. I've been using this app for years & it is brilliant. Way better than others especially when you go off the beaten track, footpaths, canal paths & tracks across fields. It gives an accurate position & does not assume you are on the nearest road. I only use it for distance, speed & time but it has loads more features. Also connects with various smart devices if you want to keep an eye on things like cadence or fitness",
            "Happy to amend my rating to more stars, however: can't quite understand why if you can create and download a route from pc to your phone, there doesn't appear to be a way for it to give you directions? Why doesn't it? Surely that's an obvious feature when being able to cycle a custom route?? That's the only reason I have this app, otherwise would use Strava (and still did anyway).... if this isn't a feature, or something that is in the pipeline, I will get rid of the app!",
            "Now not even willing to track distance... Don't bother installing (to the new users). The app is absolute rubbish right now... 1)app might close midway and when you open it the timer still runs but the distance is 0.00 that means did not track anything 2) after the update your accuracy to track distance is absolutely terrible... If I ride the same route two days in a row will show for eg. 5.5 miles for day 1 and 8 miles for day 2... Would you really want such an app on your phone... I say NEVER!",
            "My first time to use the app. Very easy, and according to my past recording of milage, very accurate... Updated: Now I've used the app several times, some for biking, some for walking. The milage is different everytime I use it on the same route. It comes up short. The gps is off too. I think I'll try a different app.",
            "Takes several minutes to open the app. Sometimes it records ZERO miles. It can take hours to upload a ride. While waiting for it to upload a ride, you cannot find today's ride inside the app."

            "Absolutely garbage app; cannot pair with my new toothbrush. I've tried literally everything. I've contacted their support team multiple times and did every step they requested (even the one where they told me to reset my connection settings with no explanation on what that entailed... which cleared out all stored WiFi/bluetooth data in my phone and still did not help.) They even sent me a replacement handle and guess what? That doesn't pair with the app either! So yeah, don't waste your time.",
            "This app is mostly mediocre when it works. It is pretty dumb about recognizing the brush movement to the point where if you are leaning down it doesn't think you're brushing anything. On top of that it only checks for brushing front and back of teeth, not top. Also currently I can't even use it because it gets stuck trying to load the login popup forever. Feels very underbaked.",
            "Generally a good experience but the last 7 days doesn't load most of the time and it's the reason for the rating. Also wish the brush had a memory to upload later. Taking phone into bathroom everytime (twice day) to record brush session isn't realistic and gets annoying. For the money this should be an included feature on future models.",
            "10/24/2020 update: The latest update claims \"A redesigned experience makes setting up your toothbrush and app easier. Plus, technical updates improve the brush to app connection\" but the app only randomly connects with the toothbrush. I love the toothbrush but the app is now useless which is the #1 reason I bought the toothbrush. The app worked fine until the latest Android update on 10/01/2020 and now it will not connect to the toothbrush. This is the only Bluetooth connected device app I'm having trouble with after the Android update.",
            "App doesn't get through setup. I have a OnePlus 6, and a new SonicCare Diamond brush. Unboxed it and fully charged it. Then downloaded the app. Lit up the toothbrush by pressing the mode button, opened the app and it detected the toothbrush ok. But once I got to the \"Let's get started\" page it just spins like a record. Tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app. Can never get past that screen."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

I fell asleep while holding my finger over the camera lens for 10 straight minutes and woke up with it in my hand. Gimmick! How can a camera lens pick up your pulse? It cant really.",
            "The app is great to fall asleep, but the \"highlights\" of snoring/noises throughout the night is literally recorded in 30 min increments all night - and nothing really gets recorded - even at the \"peaks\". The alarm, you'd think, would be a gradual increase in volume... nope. It will scare you out of bed. I haven't been able to turn it off so I set it for an afternoon time. It would be nice to be able to adjust the narrator's volume without losing the background music/audio.",

            "Disaster! It waits to record your sleeping and then fakes that there was something in the middle of the night but you have to pay for it to listen..DO NOT RECOMEND",
            "This app has never worked for me. I contacted the developer for a refund and it's been 2 weeks and 2 emails and no response. I had to contact Google to make a report for developer's nonresponsiveness. Google play also did not refund me so I had to dispute with my bank. What horrible service. DO NOT RECOMMEND. FinalUpdate : Developer refused to refund even after I showed evidence of this app NEVER working. My bank saw it as fraud and I got my money back. This company is terrible. Don't download."

            "This is the first time that I have written a review for any app. In shirt: I love it. Yes, you have YouTube, Spotify and Soundcloud, but this is different: these are dedicated (endless!) stations without a 'replay' or 'track view' option, designed to reflect a specific mood. I love the low, medium and high energy options and the simple channel range. It does what it says on the can - nothing more and nothing less. It has never crashed for me. I am addicted to the Alpha Chill Medium energy and am listening to it now as I power my way through a report that I am writing on a train trip home. I am all masked up but blissed out on the sounds (despite all these Covid challenges). I do see the points of the various critics and willl beg to disagree. For an annual subscription, the cost is reasonable (remember what we used to pay for one CD!) but it will depend on what you want to use it for. For someone like me who is very easily distracted, anxious or stressed, I love the fact that it's reliable, high quality, and legal. It puts me in The Zone. Amazing. I hope this helps you 👌😊",
            "Content is very helpful for focus for me and my child with ADHD. Some of the calmer stations are also good for meditation. App is a nice, non-distracting interface.",
            "Amazing. I am a female with adhd and this is an awesome app.",
            "Too expensive. Plus, the ADHD playlist seems counterintuitive and didn’t seem to work for me. Though in all fairness, I only tried it two or three times during the limited trial due to my schedule. But yeah, 3 stars sums this app for me.",
            "Crashes after every timed session and won't let me log my productivity. I'm evaluating the free trial and this is making me hesitant to subscribe. Emailed support and have yet to hear back."

            "My first day with the app was awesome! I'm taking advantage of the frequency (time& tone) within the app to maintain my daily practice. I haven't paid yet, but I've been practicing a few years; and the free version will do the trick for now. The voice and singing bowl effect is calming. I have a past with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I would recommend \"7mind\" to any of my friends or family. To anyone reading this: All is well and you're on the right path! Thank you, 7mind.",
            "In general the courses are not bad. What I don't like: -No decent possibility to plan in advance and confusing categories. Beside the courses there's no way to plan several days in advance=>new decision necessary every time -No proper synchronizing when using the same account on both of my phones (phone 1 (2): 106 (82) meditations, 1055 (778) min, 3 (1) day streak. It seems so synchronise it partly, as on both phones the numbers change If my health insurance wouldn't pay, I'd never pay so much.",
            "Everything superb. 5 stars if one can fast forward in a module. Atm I need to start from the beginning to get grasp of some Information, which would be better if I could directly jump to that point.",
            "very calm voice, different tyles of meditations, helps a lot so far",
            "The best meditation app i know and I'm so grateful for this app. The meditations are so awesome!!! 7 mind+ is sometimes also payed for by health insurance. Also thank you for making the app more stable and use less storage."

Yes, I know cervical fluid is not enough information to compute the ovulation day, but I would expect a sort of estimate like \"based on your inputs, ovulation might have happened on CD x\".",

It continiously tells me I might be pregnant, even in the middle of my period (and, as someone going through fertility treatment, it's made me cry twice because the ads push that I would be pregnant if I had just bought premium), it has no algorithm to adapt to cycles and is stuck on an insane 20 day cycle, and the UI hasn't been updated since the 90s."

I've seen many free things become payment-based and I'm a bit sorry about that, although I understand that the developers need to get some payment. Judging the free version only, I can say it's mostly an ig-like, fitness-centered social network with a pretty nice community for what I've seen. I may apply for the payed version in the future, so for now I don't feel like giving 5*, not until I see the full version.",
            "Ridiculous I contacted support saying that it didn't show my as my free trial was active so I couldn't cancel it they told me I shouldn't worry cause I didn't have a subscription. Never opened this app again and today got a charge from over 100$ for something their own support said I shouldn't worry about Don't use this app",

            "Love the idea. Really wanted a social network to share healthy habits with a smaller group of friends that was available for Android. App freezes at times and my follower and following counts show '0' at times even though I have a few now.",
            "Too many bugs. Too slow. Icons don't always work. Videos stall. Can't move the cursor to correct a typo unless the arrow keys are used. Notifications of comments are sent but comments can't be viewed. Profile is updated but info disappears no matter how many times it is entered and saved. I emailed developer and asked what the difference is between the free app and paid app (which is expensive) and got no answer. There are plenty of free apps on the market that work better than this."

            "I just loved this App. The instructions given are very clear voice and easy to follow. The time set is not too lengthy not too short. It has an alert schedule so it can be practiced without a break. Four star because the products are priced high. There is a problem that payment can not be done through SBI. I request the owner to lower the price for one month scheme. Also I would request to include SBI like other banks. Thank you all for a great App and I wish a great future ahead.",
            "Great app! But on day 21, became a little tough for visualization on a future self; Would love a male version for the future self. I don't mind the use of the female pronoun, but since \"she\" and \"her\" are mentioned repeatedly, I had a hard time visualizing myself.",
            "I was a great fan of this app. Of its simplicity and all but when i tried free trial, they charged me 400 already. I wanted to examine the premium version first and since i meditate regularly, i thought i would purchase the unlimited version. But they are all thief. They don't reply to your mails and neither want to help you. They want to extract money only. Worst app. And worst consumer service.",
            "I use thia app for my spirituality group at a women's halfway house. The mindful breathing and body scan alone works wonders. For someone that is new to meditation this is a great app. There are in-app purchases but I use the daily ones and they are free amd very helpful.",
            "Great app! I do wish there were a few additional voice options to choose from. For example, for whatever reason, when I have a bad headache, deeper or more alto type voices are soothing to me vs one that hit higher pitches like this one does sometimes. I still enjoy her voice and typically am passed out during the 30 minute session in less than 10 lol. It also would be nice if it rotated through a couple or few guided meditations as well. But again, as is, 5 stars for sure."

            "Many glitches in the flowity of the apps links. Repeatedly getting kick out to login back in and have to start from the beginning as nothing was saved. I never received a link for the my SAR. I tried to login into the compass website to find it would not accept my login name and password. I got a red warning screen that my password expired and I needed to update. I attempt this and it tells me my login name can not be found. Back to the app, can login in with my original info, still no SAR acces",

This app saved me from losing all my family's benefits all because I was in the hospital when it was due had to turn in late through the app they sent me the semi review 4 days before it's due or at least that's how I got it from the mail so I hope it gets in on time",
            "This app is terrible. It doesn't work it made me create a new account 5 times and each when I went back to login it kept telling me invalid login and then lock me out. I'm better off calling and sitting on hold for hours. At least the phones work. What do you mean still having problems. It didn't work period. I'm not going to keep wasting my time.",

        "comments": [
            "Decent information, but not nearly enough, which is fine considering that is a secondary function. This app is perfect in theory, though a significant amount of the population would have to download it, and keep bluetooth on, to see benefits. People need to embrace this for any real benefits. Also, to everybody giving bad reviews because of bluetooth, go read why bluetooth is the method used before trying to ruin an app. If they chose the alternative, you would probably be up in arms.",
            "The idea behind this app is great. There is a running list of travel quarantine states in the NYS website, which this app does not include. It contains safety tips as well. It should also have a dark theme. The fact that Bluetooth needs to be on in order for the proximity alerts to work is not ideal. I feel this is an unnecessary security risk and that using cell tower triangulation is just as effective and requires less battery to operate.",
            "Not sure how good it is yet. But I know it sucks the life out if my better. As the Bluetooth searches for a device and is unable too, my Samsung S9+ last week before installing the app would get close to 20 hours on a charge, now after installing this app, I get about 8 hours on a charge and the phone is down to 18%.",
            "Very happy with this app. My friend told me he doesn't have the newest version of his iOS & can't download it. Seems like we will miss a lot of people this way. Also, would be helpful to have a link to the new cluster map integrated. Everything else is wonderful. Easy to use, visually elegant, multiple languages available. I like the health log as well. ETA: After reading other reviews, I have to say it's affecting my battery life at all, & alerts are anonymous and delayed. Explains in the app!",
            "It's quite a relief having this app. It lets you go about with a little more confidence that no one is near you with Covid. Even for my husband's sake, who's a cab driver upstate and takes full precautions, I don't have to spray Lysol all over him when he walks in the house. There is no invasion of privacy; if someone is near you with Covid you get an alert with a code number. No names at all. Thank you Gov. Cuomo."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "First off DDP Yoga by far my favorite workout, I've been doing it 5 years and I love it. But this app is awful! I have a short window to work out and most of that is spent screwing around with a stupid heart monitor. I've had this app for almost a year. The heart monitor worked for about 4 months now it takes forever. On top of that the new update has made it so you can't stream workouts on chromecast. I've had it with this app I'm done with it I'm going back to the DVDs!",
            "Absolutely Broken On Pixel 4 XL and Chromecast I used to use this app all the time on my Samsung phone. I've come back to it in 2020 and I have a new smartphone. When I try to stream the workouts to my TV it crashes the app. This is the only way I like to perform the workouts, so it's pretty useless to me now.",
            "The \"upgrade \" to this app.means that when I add or change a program, it changes the day before workouts to \"Day Off\", and you can't get it back!! I am on a daily challenge and this is NOT what I want to see in my progress! It also screws up my ranking and consistency scores! This is dreadful!!",
            "Most recent update (10/26) now crashes when do Chromecast to TV. The video plays on TV, but app has crashed and hence does not track heart rate, and can't log my session in the app. Now have to run the app only on my Samsung tablet to avoid this issue.",
            "Very thorough. Happy with all the tracking options. And the way they give me a workout routine based on where I'm at. Only wish I could download the workouts but I understand why I can't. I go on vacation once a year to a cabin that has no wifi or cellphone access, so I guess I'll be taking a week off from DDPY that week."

The subscription prices are reasonable and I would advocate for it if you like the free dailey morning audio meditations and readings, I love it that it has audio meditations, check-ins, a calendar to track progress, noon and bedtime meditations, and a library However, I would appreciate the ability to use the same subscription for the Android and iPhone so that progress can be synched between devices. Thank you.",

            "I try to use this app every morning to start the day. It has a variety of deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, positive affirmations, and much more. They tailor to your needs based on the questionnaire given at the beginning. I'm enjoying this app so far!",

The fact that it exists lets me know I am not alone, I am part of a community of people who experience the world as it is and are working to make it live up to its promise. Thank you Shine!",
            "I like what I see in the free version even though most features are locked for premium. Unfortunately I will be uninstalling because at $54 a year it's a little expensive for me but I am sure it would be worth it. Great app overall."

            "This is definitely the best air quality app I have found. It's easy to use, and being able to compare different locations at a glance is very useful for me, because the pollution varies a lot surrounding me because of mountains. I also appreciate that Plume uses their own air quality index based on more recent health research than the federal government's.",
            "Fun app (great design), really well made and the forecasts are amazing. Also the scale is very interesting, very granular, currently (September 2020) in the Pacific Northwest we have the worst air quality in the world and every other air quality system is maxed out and has been for quite some time. It's hard to tell exactly how terrible it is, not these guys, super granular!",
            "It's a useful app, but I do question the accuracy of its live data. I'm in the middle of the California wildfires, and I've seen this app read much lower than Airnow, only to retroactively update its historical readings. Example: at 3pm I might see a live reading of 80 AQI. But then at 8pm, the app tells me the AQI was 120 at 3pm. And when this happens, it's always that the live reading is low! This is very frustrating and dangerous if the app is consistently on the low side. Developers??",
            "Terribly inaccurate. Kirkland, WA got AQI over 150 last Tuesday 9/8/20, and this sole app says it was OK under 100. Now all others show below 200 and this one above. All days in between are also in stark contrast with reality. I believe that this app isn't based on measured data but on \"best\" (?) guessing. Just want the authors to publish their sources, as this is all about public health. I can't trust this app to see if I'm OK to open the windows, let some fresh air to come in.",
            "Not accurate. How do I know? Large AQI spikes in Plume's own data history that weren't there in the live or forecasted AQI. This is has the best UI of all the ones I've looked at but if the data for my health is garbage... Also as of the new update I get forecast notifications all the time despite the notification settings being toggled off. No reply from the developers to my email. Please do better, I want to love this app."

            "In general this app is helpful. I have one objection - too much focus on disease! A passage that could say, \"to keep your kidneys healthy avoid theses foods\" starts out with this ramble - \"If you have bad kidneys\" \"There are many risk factors for kidney disease\" and just goes on and on planting disease, disease, disease. Do you think you could make the focus and suggestions move in the direction of healthy kidneys...?",
            "I am very disappointed with this so called app.This book really doesn't cover anything except kidney stones and that is anecdotal at best! Forget trying to find out about anything else. In an immature manner benefiting no one but a complete moron, the language of this app is degrading. The sections described only briefly the diseases. Barely covered (if at all) are various ailments of the kidneys. Even if a disease or condition is mentioned, what is said about it is minimal. This app even suggests that kidney disease can be cured which is not the case. Kidney damage is permanent and if severe enough will lead to dialysis or total kidney failure. I think I am giving this app two stars out of the kindness of my heart. I would not recommend this app to anyone except an elementary school student of middle grade.",
            "Too many and too frequent add updates, which makes the page one is reading jump all over the page. Since there is no option to pay for an add-free version, I simply uninstalled this annoying piece of junk.",
            "I have to use this app and practice the natural way to keep my and my familys kidneys healthy. My better half had a kidney transplant, it was eye opening to see how many people are suffering from kidney disease. if you can keep your kidneys healthy now, you are saving yourself/loved one from 30 hours a week in a dialysis clinic. It's unimaginable how many people are in some state of kidney failure. We need to prevent this disease becoming our future. Start here naturally ♡",
            "The author of this app really works hard to update frequently & cover all topics in re kidneys. Sometimes the writer is too simplistic & does not use the best grammar"

Unfortunately there were some products that it didn't have in its database, but this app will certainly come in handy anyway. I hope the database is expanded in the future!",

            "The app works as expected. However, there is an option/feature for a clinician review of an ECG that doesn't work. I keep getting a generic network error. Also, there seems to be a premium version, but like the issue with the clinician review, you get an error when you attempt to sign up. As such, it is not clear that all the stated features of the app actually work or are available.",
            "Extremely disappointed for a top tier company. This app is not optimized for phone. The bp cards are hard to see on the front screen. The number between cards overlap. The only way to see the current bp is to click in that card. Once in a card you can't view any other bp without existing. When trying to share it doesn't output bp. It only display place holder for ekg, and weight even though of those items were entered. Its so poor I have to write down the bp on paper to share with doctors",
            "No Terms of Service. No Privacy Policy. Using the App requires an account. Why? You must agree to these two before creating an account. Clicking on each link opens a blank page. I will not agree to these two before reading the Terms of Service Privacy Policy. The APP will not continue without checking that box. Thus the Omron Connect APP does not work. Fix it. Create web pages with these documents, or allow me to start the app.",
            "When I upgraded to a new phone (Samsung note 10), it's been a year my phone can't connect to the omron. I followed the advice and steps how to reconnect but it's all failure. The Bluetooth can see the omron but can't connect. Now, I don't know what to do. Either just use it without connecting to my phone or throw it away to garbage. Sucks! Its giving me hypertension.",
            "This app has been working well with my Omron BP7900. Just a few times the results transfer were not successful but after retrying then ok. It also connects and automatically transfers data to Android Fit very fast but doesn't have the option to choose for Samsung health or Apple health apps. Please add them in. They are very popular devices with a lot of users using their apps."

Used a free app called Wunderfind to actually find device. Moved slowly to do it, but ultimately was helpful Do not reccomend this app. Also, avoid the following Find my bluetooth Nearby BLE device",
            "I was able to find my Fitbit, but it would tell me I was hot and then go cold. When I finally found it, the Fitbit was not near the hot section until I was almost on top of it. The changing from warm to hot was fluctuating so much, I was so confused in which way to go. I was about to give up, then I thought, I spent too much money for this to give up.",
            "Well, 2 years later, another lost Fitbit and I'm turning to this helpful app again. After searching every nook and cranny of my place several times I did what I should have done to begin with and searched with rhis app which found my Versa in under a minute 😂 I wish everything worked this well - good job Find My Fitbit App!",

            "I absolutely love this app. The only things I would love to see added are to be able to have sub-categories and sub-steps of goals (with their own reminders, not just the checklist optiom we have currently) and to be able to schedule recurring tasks multiple times per day/month/year not just per week.",
            "This app is great and the support team is fast and friendly and I'm having a bit of trouble finding the right course for me but I just downloaded it recently and there are thousands of courses so I'm sure I'll find something. I kind of wish they had courses for specific mental illnesses like depression anxiety and eating disorders though but that's the only really thing I can think of at the moment that I'd change.",
            "Remente is a wonderful app! So user friendly, with great tools such as the lifewheel and mood rating. It has helped me a lot with my wellbeing and to gain clarity. I love it! And highly recommend it!!",

            "Awesome! 👏 Definitely worth the $5.00. Similar to \"Ambience\" except this is an Oriental/Asian flair....... suggestion: Is it possible to group in categories the sounds please? ex: all water sounds, music, birds, etc... this would make it so much easier to locate the sounds I would like to include in my mixes. Also, it would be great to play a few minutes of EACH favourite during the course of the timer. It appears only one can play for the duration of the timer. Thanks for listening!✌️",
            "Really like this app. It's convenient how you can mix a multitude of sounds without much restrictions. However, I couldn't seem to find a way to keep it playing in the background when the app is minimized anywhere in the settings, which is unfortunate. Overall though, it's something great to listen to overnight if you need some relaxing zen to help you sleep, and even has a timer mode.",
            "This last couple of days it's been so chaotic, I've had sleep issues and anxiety more than ever. I came back to this app, and decided to try the pro version. It's worth it, I set the timer and fall asleep before reaching the end. I'd just advise to correct some loops, but other than that, this app works wonderfully. Thanks to all the team for bringing this app to us, and I'd like to also thank Jessika for solving my doubts about the app, you all really care about us the users ♥️",
            "I am a light sleeper and have ringing in my ears so i have to have a fan or some kind of steady sound at night to sleep. When we go camping, i use this app to help me sleep. It has helped me many time, while camping or staying in hotels.",
            "I like this app so far. It lets you mix different relaxing sounds to create you perfect meditating sounds and then you can save those to use over and over. I also liked that when you use it on the timer, it fades out instead of just an abrupt stop. I purchased the upgrade and I'm a bit disappointed it only gives you about 8 new sounds, which are similar to the free ones."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Same complaint for exercises that are for time. But it's really not THAT big of a deal. Overall, great app!",

The only thing I dont prefer is the AutoCap of the first letter when creating a new exercise etc. I automatically do this on my own text keyboard and the tool reverses my natural habit.",
            "Easy to use! The only thing I wish it would do is connect with my Fitbit. There isn't one exercise I haven't found not already downloaded.

            "This has the straightforward functionality that I want for creating and tracking workouts.

For each exercise, number of reps is the minimum info needed, with options to easily track weight used (if relevant), elapsed time, and notes. Does what it says - well named!",
            "Very nice to use, once you get past the learning curve. The developer is very responsive. Very customizable. For example, for exercises I do at the gym on their machines, l prefixed the exercise name with initials of the gym to keep them all together. I set up a routine for each day. Exercises can be moved around within a routine. Your data can be exported by the app as a .CSV file (which can be read by any spreadsheet program) to your email."

I've restarted my phone, force closed the app and reopened it, my next option is reinstalling it but if that doesn't work then I'm forced to try other apps, which may not give me nearly as many options for calming myself down so I don't self harm.",

Self harm is a very serious struggle and I'm glad that there's more apps to help with it.

Thank you for helping out and spreading more awareness!!! <3",

Perhaps adding the option of music during the meditation might be the only improvement I would make... and possibly lengthen the log area just about 20-30 more characters for logging ideas. Thanks again for providing the app.",
            "I love this app! It really works if you give it a chance, it's also something from the Government that's REALLY FREE! I been suffering from PTSD for over 20 years. Living on a fixed income makes it impossible to afford someone elses income. Just by hapenstance I found this & I thank God that I have a way to calm myself down on/in those \"uncomfortable\" times.",
            "Neat, clean, simple, and simply the best meditation app. No ads, no subscriptions - just mindfulness. Kudos to the great work! Note: used to be buggy when I tried a year or two ago. But now (as of summer 2020) it is totally bug-free and faultless.",
            "Such an awesome app that too free of cost...the mindfulness exercise they provide I thought they will charge for it because they are so helpful and for every thing in your life a mindfulness is present whether for emotional distress,nap,sleep, eating,walking everything...thank you so much the developers..god bless you ❤️",
            "By far one of the best and cleanest and most simple mindfulness app I have ever used. The lessons are very helpful too, you can really tell this was created out of good and kind intentions: to help others be more self-aware in order for us to execute decisions thought about thoroughly. Thank you so much!"

            "FIX THIS APP!!!!! I, too, used to love and use the app regularly. But lately it has not recorded my walks accurately and because I can't walk too often in the winter due to knee issues, it is extremely important that when I do walk, it is recorded. The shelter I walk for needs as many people counted as possible! UPDATE: App appears to be fixed and working better. Now that the weather is cooler I'll be walking more and will monitor walks to make sure they are counted. So far so good. Thank you!",
            "It's ok when it works. I use it to help keep track of fitness levels on a number of dogs with different health concerns and fitness needs. It's annoying because it automatically selects every dog when you open it so you have to go through and unselect for each walk,it's hard to remove dogs as well. In my case it's only recording every other walk right now.",
            "Still doesn't work. Even after I installed the new UPDATED app, it still didn't track my walk. This happens constantly. I set it to walk, then when I get done and check my progress, it says I haven't walked at all. Frustrating! Will be deleting again and finding another app.",
            "Love what this app does from a charity standpoint but dissapointed with the recent updates that significantly reduced functionality & usefulness. Really wish you could still open up prior walks in a map and zoom in. That was a very useful feature. And that you could see more than just your most recent walks in a map view. Now I sometimes use my actual hiking app instead. The updates ruined it.",
            "I walk for rescues using both WoofTrax and Resqwalk. I start and stop them at the same times, and have checked the distance walked against my Fitbit. WoofTrax does not record as many miles per walk as Resqwalk and Fitbit record. I would rate this app more highly, if not for the lack of recorded miles."

        "description": "Turn your smartphone into your personal Heart Rate Monitor!\r\n\r\nHeart rate or heartbeat is an important measure of health and fitness. Using the Heart Rate Monitor app, you can now measure and monitor your heart rate! And also use it for optimizing your exercise and to track your progress.\r\n\r\nWhy is this the best heart rate monitor app?\r\n✓ Incredibly accurate in measuring your heartbeat. \r\n✓ Free with unlimited heart rate measurements. \r\n✓ Multiple user profiles. Track the heart health of your family members in a single app. \r\n✓ Save and share your heartbeat graphs with your health care provider. \r\n✓ Enhanced by Health Infinity insights.\r\n✓ Connect to Google Fit.\r\n✓ Backup your measurements securely.\r\n\r\nHow to use the Heart Rate Monitor free app to measure heartbeat?\r\n★ Place and lightly hold your index finger against the back camera lens and flashlight.\r\n★ It uses your phones built-in camera to track color changes on the fingertip that are directly linked to your pulse. \r\n★ Do not press too hard, otherwise, blood circulation will be altered and the results could be affected.\r\n★ Remain calm and try not to move too much during the measurement, as this can compromise measurement accuracy.\r\n★ Do not measure with cold fingers when the blood circulation is poor.\r\n\r\nIs it accurate?\r\nHeart Rate Monitor is highly accurate as it uses the same technique that medical pulse oximeters use. It does not need any external hardware. \r\nThe app then uses our Award winning Heartbeat Fusion algorithm used by Health Infinity for detecting the heart rate accurately. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Normal Heart Rate?\r\nA normal heartbeat for adults ranges from 60to 100 beats per minute (BPM). However, keep in mind that many factors can influence it, including Activity level, Fitness level, Body size, Stress, Emotion, Cardiovascular health, etc. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Resting Heart Rate?\r\nYour resting heart rate gives you a view of your heart's fitness. It varies depending on your age and training level. A very fit and athletic person has a lower resting HR than someone who is less active. Eager to know if your fitness level has improved? Measure your heartbeat on a regular basis and monitor the progress of your resting heart rate. \r\n\r\nFitness Usage:\r\nIt is also very suitable for people who would like to measure their workout intensity e.g Running, Gym or any kind of training. It is perfect for High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) or Cardio.\r\n\r\nMultiple User Profiles:\r\nYou can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them can have their own individual measurement history.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well-lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\r\n- This application should not be used as a medical device.\r\n\r\nFor Health App Developers:\r\nUse our framework to add Heart Rate measurements to your app. Contact us for documentation and sample code. \r\n\r\nProduct Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/heart-rate-monitor\r\n\r\nMade with ♥ by Droid Infinity!",

The prizes are lame and repetitive, and education component is weak.( and wouldn't it be great if the app could review with your kids where they spent their brushing time after each brush? That technology exists and would be very helpful).",
            "Can't sync with other devices. My child is too young to brush his teeth alone and it's not always the same parent helping. Also when my phone died he had to start over so that was no fun. Additionally, he enjoys the app but the reward is almost always food. There is all kinds of food but the animation of the character eating is brief and always the same, so food is boring.",
            "A really great app that has engaged my daughter in her daily dental hygiene. After about 2 weeks it does become repetitious. I would suggest seasonal themed backgrounds and costumes. Trendy dance moves like the floss or even just a dab. Keeping the app up with current trends would get kids more motivate them to keep up their progress. Just a suggestion. Otherwise, great app. L-O-V-E it.",
            "App won't connect to the toothbrushes since the update. We had connectivity issues before, and usually got it to work for one of the toothbrushes before having to troubleshoot for the next toothbrush, but we could make it work well enough. Now the app won't even recognize the toothbrushes, even though I can show my phone lists it as an available device for Bluetooth. This app has been a major headache in our house.",
            "It often has trouble connecting to bluetooth with toothbrush. App mixes up characters between my 2 kids & they'll get upset thinking sister is using their program. My 1 girl gets all the awesome cat ears & stuff while the other gets only top hats & a plunger. Tonight my 1 girl got a 2nd present (gold) & the other did not. Needless to say that does not go over well with little kids... Downgrading to 1 star...keeps skipping the same one of my girls with the 2nd special present. Unnecessary tears."

For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.\r\n\r\nLosing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you’ve already developed diabetes, it’s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.\r\n\r\nNutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range. To manage your blood glucose, you need to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if you take any. What you choose to eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are all important in keeping your blood glucose level in the range that your health care team recommends.\r\n\r\nDIABETIC RECIPES APP EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nThis is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app.\r\nAs the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you’re cooking.\r\n\r\nTheme Support\r\n\r\nProtect your eyes from being hurt by a bright screen at night by enabling dark mode.\r\nMake your diabetic recipes cooking experience more comfortable at night.\r\n\r\nSmart Shopping List for Your Diet Control\r\n\r\nAn organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won’t miss any for the recipe.

            "Paid for it years ago. Then one day it changed and was asked to pay more for more content?!The only small criticism I have is that some body alignments are not displayed at all. Some poses should be displayed from different angles or with more detailed narration on body alignment. After all doing it wrong can have adverse effect on the body, especially when someone is a beginner. Had to Google some details to make sure am doing it with the right form. Still the best I ever used.",
            "When making your own routine, many poses won't tell it's time to change poses which is the whole point. Also would be nice if it announced the end of a self made routine instead of leaving you hanging. For $120 a year I expected those types of glitches to be worked out.",
            "RED FLAG - MUST GIVE 30 DAYS NOTICE TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION! So they get $69 USD from you for a \"free week subscription\" whether you decide to keep the app or not! Other than a chart that shows poses, there is nothing free about this app... if you want to join a class, you must subscribe to a \"free week\". If you want to watch an old class, you must subscribe to a \"free week\". If you want to listen to a meditation, you must subscribe... so disappointing",

            "I have always loved this app but it doesn't seem to work as well with my FitBit Versa 2 Special Edition than it did with my FitBit Blaze. For example, it looks like it doubled my steps from yesterday. I'm guessing the intelligent merging between FitBit and Fit isn't working correctly, but I don't understand how it works enough to make a judgement call there. I've looked online for support but cannot find anything so I'm hoping a review might snag me some support. As of right now, the app is undependable to the point of being unusable for me.",
            "I downloaded this app because I needed a bridge between my Fitbit data and Google Fit. I've been using a Fitbit for many years. My favorite game uses Google Fit data for game rewards, but my Fitbit isn't compatible with Google Fit, so I was missing out on a lot of rewards. I use FitToFit several times a day to sync my Fitbit with Google Fit, and now I can hatch more eggs in the game (yaaay!).",
            "App has stopped syncing body weight entirely. It just reports \"-\" for each transfer, when there are definitely entries in Fit for weight. I got this app to centralize all my data in Fitbit, and when it was working I loved it - but now a key function has stopped working. My smart scale syncs to Fit but not Fitbit, so this was my main way to consolidate that part of the data. Please fix!",
            "I have been trying to import data from fitbit fo a day now, and it seems like during the import some days are just missing from the data. And the app never gives an update so I 'ever know if it' s finished importing or not. I just might delete it.",
            "The numbers are all over the place. Yesterday, my Fitbit watch tracked 15,376 steps and my Google Fit app said 11,095. Did the sync and the numbers on the two apps didn't change. The Fitbit number on the FitToFit app matched but the Google Fit number said 19,062. Seems to be missing the whole point and now I'm thinking I have to get a new watch altogether."

            "this app has great potential but it needs work on its user interface, navigation and food variety. I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",
            "Lactose free food search, there is a quite a good spread of foods in the database. There are some foods not covered by this app",
            "Limited food selection. For example, acorn squash not listed. Grey color coding not explained. Would not use as definitive guide. Last updated over 2 years ago.",
            "So easy to use and so many different types of food listed. My very favorite app to use for food sensitivities!"

        "description": "Do you like to walk outdoors for exercise?  If so, this powerful GPS fitness app is for you!  \r\n\r\nMade to the highest standards, Walking Odometer Pro is a GPS fitness app for walking and hiking designed for outdoor use.  Take it for a walk or run and it will accurately record your route, distance traveled, calories burned, weight lost, elevation changes, and more.  \r\n\r\nUnlike a step pedometer, Walking Odometer Pro leverages the power of GPS, and by doing so, is able to provide more accurate measurements for distance walked and calories burned than can be achieved with a simple step counting pedometer.   \r\n\r\nSet long term or short term goals for yourself to motivate you to walk or run to a better fitness level.  Choose a calorie goal, distance goal or decide how many pounds or kilograms of fat you would like to lose, then view your progress during and after your exercises.  \r\n\r\nThe application allows you to sort and view your accomplishments by day, month, week or year.  Or, view speed, altitude and distance profiles for any given recording.  \r\n\r\nThe app is easy to use.  Simply press the start button, close the app and begin your activity.     \r\n\r\nThe application's odometer is internally calibrated so there is no need for you to go through a lengthy trial-and-error calibration method.  \r\n\r\nIf you need to interrupt your walk, you can pause an  activity and resume it at a later point in time.  Pauses and resumes are reflected on the trail map which will clearly show split distances and other stats.  \r\n\r\nThere is a one-of-a-kind odometer on the first screen that shows your distance.  The meter was modeled after the rolling drum odometers seen in old cars and functions the same way -- the display actually rolls in real time as you walk / run.  \r\n\r\nThe route maps include navigation features that will allow you retrace your footsteps if you happen to get lost while walking in new and unfamiliar areas.  \r\n\r\nOther features include:\r\n\r\n👣   Link your walks to Google Earth with a single tap.  \r\n\r\n👣   Voice messages will be called out to you indicating your distance every 1/4 km or 1/4 mile and at every 10 minute mark.  \r\n\r\n👣   Lock-protected activity control panel prevents accidental termination of a recording.  \r\n\r\n👣   Secure your data by backing it up regularly.  Our backup and restore utility does not require any purchase or account activation.  Backup / Export your accomplishments as kml, gpx and csv files.

        "description": "COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. \r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Works: \r\nIf someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! \r\n\r\nThe BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:\r\nVDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. \r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. \r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!",

It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don't see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don't see Google doing that though...",
            "Update - I uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. However, please make more helpful error messages though. Older review - I get an 'Internal Error, please try again' when I try to set Exposure Notifications (I have both bluetooth and Wifi enabled - using a Galaxy S10). Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it's a 'user error', phone configuration or something else out of my control.",
            "I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but for some reason it keeps turning location services off on its own? I'll randomly get a notification that my C ovidwize notifications have been enabled only to discover it hasn't been scanning for the last couple of weeks.",
            "While I understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do, the app checking my location consistently at 1am, and 3am is crazy! It is not checking my location when I am actually out and about during the day. I will be deleting this as I find that for me, it is worthless. Based on reply..let me correct that to exposure checks at 2+am, 3+am, 4+am, 5+am, do no good for me as thats when I'm home asleep. Those are the check times that have been reported to me.",
            "Bluetooth has always had security issues! Hackers can get into our phones via Bluetooth. Search Google: \"Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution,\" ... on MSN News/Gizmodo, 9/10/2020. Also, Bluetooth constantly searches, draining batteries. I think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks, then the VDH could use that to cross-reference to see if any app users were around an app reported Covid-19 victim."

To my knowledge, there aren't alternative developmental milestone charts even available.

            "Occam's Razor - I am glad to see they stripped most of the fancy unnecessary features. You can take a session with a trainer as a guest. Awsome! But, for new users, it is not very clear how they should proceed. Unless they take Master Clases they wouldn't understand what to do. I suggest the app should play the audio guided-meditation steps when we request for a sitting with a trainer. Of course, they should be able to check a box to skip it. --- Earlier Review --- Very convenient to request for remote meditation sessions with a trainer. Awesome. Now a days, not many apps provide support phone numbers and email addresses. This app offers the same. Checkout Profile->Settings->Help.",

I try to get the $50 amazon card but it keeps on saying that its out of stock. If it is put of stock then why do you have it on there?",
            "Used to be really good, but there have been a lot of ads recently that make it hard to navigate. If you can get through that, though, the app is functional and intuative. It let's you log a number of other things such as sleep, aches, etc. that allows for complex predictions. There is also a commjnity tab with a hood communtiy and many lady-related articles. Not as good as it used to be, but it still does what it's supposed to.",
            "it has ads feigning that you will win prizes but it blocks you from ever getting the final puzzle peice. Its a really pretty and effective period tracking app but the ads are too much of a pain to be worth it.",
            "This is so much more than a period tracker. There's a library, horoscope reading, in app community, sleep meditation! You can also basically track your health on here. All the extra content is very nice to have. Definitely recommend.",
            "It is a good app, but more inclusivity would be great. Not only women have periods and changing the word \"woman\" for the word \"person\" in articles sure will halp this app be more enjoyable and useful for all kinds of people."

            "Glad I purchased the Premium. Couple of feedbacks and preferences I've noticed since using this for a few weeks now. I wish there was a better way to construct different and multiple playlists. I have multiple playlists for very diff topics. Sometimes I wish I could play all of them while I sleep. Sometimes I wish I can play some. But it's designed to only play 1 playlist, and you can't modify it without changing the name of the affirmation altogether.",
            "I love the concept for the app, however, there are a handful of small usability issues that become really annoying the more you use the app. 1) No filter or search on affirmation record screen 2) No way to select multiple hashtag playlist for playback 3) No integrated way to stream own music while listening to affirmations. Dropping music vol in thinkup and opening other app causes affirmations to not be loud enough. Still like it a lot, though.",
            "*Edit: THIS APP DOESN'T WORK ON MORE THAN ONE DEVICE. There is no \"restore purchase\" option on my second phone when I download the app, because it DOES recognize that I've already got the premium plan. However, none of my recordings are there. I would have to re-record everything to use this on my other phone.This is a fatal flaw. Can you please fix this so the app can be used on multiple devices?",
            "I like that I can record my affirmations in my own voice. There are a lot of affirmations to choose from and I can edit them to make them personal to me. It would help if there were suggestions given on what background music to use to reach your desired goal. You can also change the level of your voice to the background on the paid version but no guidance is given. Also, the Android version is much cheaper than the one for my iPhone which I thought was weird.",
            "Unfortunately, the Android version isn't fully updated with all the features that the Apple version has. I hope you will update it asap. I bought the Premium version on Android and was dissapointed to see features missing: there is no option to control the speed of the loop of affirmations and there is no Stats tab with statistics about your progress. Such a shame!"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

All of them are on 1 minute cycles, and when the track loops, it pauses/freezes for a split second, which sounds terrible. Low quality app, and would get a refund if I could. Buy one of the better apps that don't have major issues like this one.",
            "Hey. I like this app a lot. I have actually downloaded it for my play restaraunt. It is really effective. I have not used it that much, but this is the most amazing app! I want to upgrade to premium but not that soon. And if you are thinking of a good OM chanting app, please download this 1. Really good. Thanks for reading this review.",
            "I've just recently purchased the app. I gave it 2 stars because when I'm listening to the meditation, it suddenly goes off, which is not good at all. I paid for premium, and I'm hoped to receive premium service. :(",

            "Ok, Hi! First off, This app is just fantastic! I can always watch out where the closest drug use has been taken! I love the chemistry part and the added information of the drug! I am actually really interested in drugs (Of course I won't take any) and how it affects you mentally. Even though I am only 13 years old, I learn alot already, how a type of drug can have an effect on me. Since now it might slowly be the stage where people always take drugs, I will always have a cautious eye!",
            "I honestly think this is a great app. I have no use for it myself atm. But life is life and people will be people. This info is often hard to scrap together. Can't vouch for accuracy bc it's too far away but if credible it could be a great resource for many many people and could help lessen stigmas by even existing. I am no advocate for or against the subject of this app. But it has the potential to save many many lives. Just hope that aspect was part of the motivation for creating this. Props.",
            "The app is great for learning about all types of drugs. I like how it also lists its soures, but the app can be improved on. For example, almost every single drug I see is MDMA. Mix it up! Not every drug is MDMA. Also, it would be cool if you could go to the Substances tab and click on a substance that has a drop down on all drugs affiliated. Like if I click on Nicotine, there would be a dropdown list of all drugs containing nicotine.",
            "This is an amazing app! Very user-friendly, with a lot of important resources. I especially love the database of chemicals. Much-recommended for anyone who uses psychoactive drugs.",
            "This app is AWESOME but something I would like is to explain the difference between ways of consuming, I know there is the graph but I think that difference could be more explained and that'd be cool and really useful"

And I still have to keep exploring it, but it's really nice and user friendly!",
            "This is amazing! Very organized with lots of herbs and diseases with their remedies. I hope you can expand the app more (more herbs and diseases it can cure, maybe even how to plant these herbs, and how to use them) it's a lot to ask from me, I know 😂😂😂 But I'm sure doing so will result in this app becoming more popular as I'm already in love with this simply organized version 😍😍😍 Thanks a lot! Keep improving 🥺🥺🥺",

Especially during Covid-19, when at first I was put in an isolated room. In the end, when daddy was allowed in the room then he was in charge of recording the contractions and acutally it is sooooo nice to have these memories here.. I can actually see when IT GOT REAL 💛",
            "Love how simple and effective this app is. Way better than I expected. My wife is currently in labor and we've been using the app for a few hours and love the simple input and the data visualization. The intensity tracking was another pleasant surprise. Thank you so much for creating this app!!",
            "Very helpful app was fairly clear to use and helped me give the right information to my healthcare providers. I recommend checking out the settings as there is a lot more \"hidden\" to the app then what the front or dashboard shows.",
            "Simple and straightforward. It's helping me sort out my stop-and-go contractions. Thank you! I'm just not sure how to track with the \"intensity\" tab. Everything else works great.",
            "Amazing, definitely designed so you don't have to use a lot of brain power which is important during painful contractions when all you can do is hit start."

My kid gets bored & opts out of using it. I'm still keeping it. Where can I buy this toothbrush in Seoul? 이 칫솔은 한국에서 어디에서 팔아요?"

I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

But I'm here to say it actually exported my workout straight to Dropbox like it used to years ago. I nearly left this app a few weeks ago, after years of use...

            "I love the 3D nature of the app. And, it gives great tips along the way by week. I hate the tips that make assumptions, though. We formula feed, and rather than say his first swallows of milk, for instance, the app always depicts breastfeeding as the only choice. It's not. Families in very developed countries make decisions that are best for them, and should still feel supported, not judged by an app!",
            "I LOVE this app. This is my 3rd pregnancy, and I've used it for all 3! It's informative, and I love the pictures and details that let me see virtually into my belly! I also share it with my kids who LOVE looking at their little sibling.",

            "Good App.. Great for people with restrictions when it comes to walking or going out. I made a 50km log and watched an ad Then I clicked on a 10km log and watched that ad. So does that mean that i'll have 60km in total in a span of a couple of hours? I take full responsibilty for my account. Just want to know cuz I cant find a way to stop walking and cracking eggs. Just wondering thank you and this was released on my b-day so that's pretty cool.",

Pokewalk doesn't work for my pokemon go but will register to google fit. Some please help me for this hasn't happen until the last community day with the charmanders. If someone could send me steps I would highly appreciate it because where I am going out isnt the best with covid 19 and I tend to do my shopping thru pickup only. Thanks in advance Will update if I can get it fixed. Please help with any guidance. Thank you Also I tried looking for the support email but I don't see it on the page. Could you share it or where could I find it.",
            "It's been several days since it's log any distance. I went thru all the protocols to fix it and nothing is working. Please help! EDIT: Figured out the issue thru a reddit post. Go to pokemon go app info, permissions and make sure you allow physical activity. I'm not sure how it got reset but this fixed my issue if you're no recording steps. This app is awesome!",
            "The app overall is really good and works perfectly with Pokemon go the only problem I've been facing is there may of been a patch so when I try and use the app it doesn't log my walk for pokemon go, if there is a possible fix that would be awesome, it only stop working recently, I have a Motorola G7"

            "I've had every problem imaginable with this app. It freezes constantly, drops exercises from my exercise progam, takes multiple attempts for my PT's calls to actually connect for remote therapy, etc. I've been \"using\" it since late June 2020 since it's what my PT uses. Promising app, but VERY BUGGY. I've probably spent more time trying to get it to work than actually being able to use it.",
            "I'm on Samsung S 10 E. I have it a try for months but surrender. It keeps making me restart the app to record my completion. I like all the features if the app would work. Good video and timer. Now I just use it to go through the PT list but that's all. I hope things get better. I really respond to data. Tx.",
            "Potentially a very useful app but it needs a serious update. When I go to record my daily effort then often I have to tap at least twice on a number for the app to accept it. Also when I enter a partial effort then the app occasionally calculates an erroneous percentage. Also the goal targets can only be set by your physio, you cannot amend them yourself.",
            "Finally time set reminder are back! It so much easier like this. Nice and easy to use. I will reserve 1 star untill the bug were you click \"Next\" (as in complete) is not working correctly and you need to press it repeatedly or even after it work it didn't register so you need to go back. Please keep the thick system however"

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "All the guesswork is gone with this App. It calculates my macros and finds the food to make them up. I love that it is all planned. Simple meals, nothing that requires a long time to prep. Great for busy people. I also love having the shopping list. The cherry on top is the low cost of the upgrade. The only thing I wish is there was more variety included in their food suggestions.",
            "Not a terrible app. Takes a lot of the guesswork out of what I should eat. I just wish there were more recipes. I'm not creative in the kitchen, so I keep getting stuck with bland chicken and rice. Would also like if veggies weren't limited. No one ever failed fat camp from eating too much broccoli.",
            "This app is perfect. I've trained for years and I find it so hard to just eat right and know when and what to eat. This app has made it way too simple while at the same time giving a clear breakdown on what you need and your intake. Also everything is healthy , you just have to be dedicated. Heres the kicker... this app gives you the same information for free that you'd have to pay for normally.",
            "I've liked the app so far, but the portion size directions are a little confusing sometimes. I'd love it if there was a way to convert the oz. into measurements like cups as I dont own a food scale. Also, some of the recipes call for ingredients that never ended up on the shopping list portion of the app. Overall, it's doing its job, but the UX could be improved.",
            "For a free app it's not bad. The only down side is that there's not enough varietys of foods."

            "Unlike most other apps, you have to log in every time and it has no fingerprint access. Secondly, to make an appointment, you first choose the doctor and then the time. Often the time is crucial. The worst fault, however, is the misleading information. I had a vaccination in 2018 and the information said \"expiry date 2019\" so I got a second one. This year I wanted to repeat it, but was told it was still valid - the date was for the dose itself. How many others have been confused by this?",
            "Either notifies you twice about new info, or doesn't notify you at all. Email notifications tell you that you have a new record in \"diagnosis\" - a category that doesn't exist in the app. So you have to go through all of the categories and look for it, but the app doesn't tell you which records are new.

            "Helps me keep track of when my period weeks are, which my birth control already basically does with the placebo week. I loved this app before it updated to what it is now. Now it is hard to use, it erased my data at one point, and just really doesn't work as well as it used to. Now that I have a new phone, I wanted to sign up for an account to save my data from my old phone, but it keeps giving an error and not telling me if there's even anything that I need to fix to make it work. Honestly just wish they'd roll back the app to what it was. :/",
            "Still not happy with current layout. Why would you update to a less intuitive interface? Edit: Is there a plan to update again? Can you add the previous features back? Before the layout changed, this app was reassuring, satisfying, and easy to use. Having the ability to see all symptom options, and the ones chosen for the day floating inside the days box, all on the main page and visible at once. The nice details are now missing. And this thing is glitchy. It keeps messing up my cycles.",
            "Nothing like it was before the new update. Lots of features missing, including the custom log function. I have it set to send daily notifications and it does not work at all, it did before. It's a shame, really. The app, with what it does have, does what its supposed to do I suppose...except for the notifications.",
            "Since it did the update that renovated the whole app it's hard to use, every week it was giving me reminders that my IUD is up (It's not), it's slow, buggy, and irritating. I enjoyed it much more before they decided to basically turn it into a whole other app, it is nothing like it was before. You ruined your own app! This really sucks because I now feel stuck using it, because I've been using it for years and it's the only app I know of that'll track my cycle with my hormonal IUD",
            "I had stopped using this app for a bit, only to come back to it and it being completely unusable. I hit the log only to not be able to input anything! What's the point? It's almost as though this update was never tested before it was released. This is a 'revert until we fix this bug' type of situation and apologize to all your users. We can wait for an update....a reliable app tracking our periods to make sure we don't get pregnant, becoming unreliable can be life altering. Just a thought. 😡"

            "Trully a great app with all the riding data necessary for an amature to a serious cyclist . One feature that is greatly missed is the ability to select a safety contact and that that particular person cannot follow you on your ride. This is a great safety feature for both road riders and MTB riders. Accidents can happen - and this feature could save ones life. Other competitive apps carry this feature however not the detailed metrics of cyclemeter. Please take this under consideration on your next update.",
            "Have been using this since March 2020 after trialling Strava. This one I much prefer but purely a personal choice. The best experience I have had so far is the support from the developers. I moved from Apple to Android and expected to pay for the elite version again. I contacted Avio prior to downloading and received a long, well thought out reply containing full step by step instructions in how to transfer my data from iOS to Android. This worked first time. Fantastic service.",
            "The app is great, but the developers need to add a user account system so that your data is automatically synced to their servers and isn't dependent on your device. My Android phone malfunctioned and I lost all my rides and my paid Elite plan because the data was not saved on cloud. Edit on 02 September 2020 after getting a power meter: this app is insane! The amount of features they've got are incredible for the price and are perfectly suited for training.",
            "The best cycling computer app, with full customizable screens, all the data gathering (serves Bluetooth, ant+ for the sensors) and capturing options. Flawless data presentation. Well thought and engineered, very stable.",
            "Great app and had everything I'm looking for but a few things are totally off. I just cycled and in the splits screen my highest speed was 70mph, which just wasn't possible. But in the Laps/intervals screen my highest speed was 38mph. In the stopwatch my highest speed was 45mph. So, I have absolutely no idea what my speed were. Also, the stop detection doesn't seem to stop the clock when you stop. I have no idea how to set timers for interval training. Love it but needs a bit of work."

            "I love this app. It gives you such a great variety of diet plans and what each one targets. I had my gallbladder and and needed a low fat diet and I found it here. I love the simple shopping list for each week which has made it so simple. The only thing I would like differently is for there to have every week different so you aren't repeating the week before. Overall awesome!",
            "I think I like the meal reminder the best then the grocery list and the variety of plans third. Been using it a long long time.",
            "I miss the support groups that used to be on the app. I met someone from the Netherlands and we became great support tools for each other, and good friends. I miss the \"walk with me\" support group where all the ladies would challenge and encourage each other to walk everyday. This used to be the best part, and it was what made you different from all the other diet apps. Please consider bringing it back.",
            "I've had this app through several different phones over the years. However, even though I've upgraded to pro and there have been updates, there never seem to be any new plans. I saw one reviewer mention keto plans, and I was REALLY hoping for the exact same thing! With as popular and well-supported with research as keto is, you'd think they would add it on here. Oh well......come on, guys, change with the times! Science does, and so should you. :-("

            "I regret that I had to delete this app. It just blows through my battery. It was at 65% at 1:00, by 4:15, the charge was completely drained. It has a lot of useful extras that others don't appear to have, but I was unable to figure out how to use them. I do very light weight training (I'm 74 and dealing with some challenging health issues) but I couldn't input how much they weigh and I shouldn't have to email for \"how to\" instructions for everything I want to record.",
            "The most wonderful tracking Application. But, if it became updated to the most recents as now not as the last of 2018",
            "i set this app to my step 16 inches and it became unable to keep accurate track. it is a nice app. Told me the distance while traveling from where i am to where i was going in a car. Sleep was off but relaxing or at rest was accurate. Don't know about any other things because it is hard to tell. Didnt help to make the step counter more accurate, by using their adjustment. in fact made no difference am reinstalling and will see if it works better 2nd time around. Blind in one eye, cant c out othe",
            "I really enjoy this app. It gives me helpful information about how I use my time and I don't have to remember to turn it on when I change activities. The changes I would like to see is the ability to switch from 24 hr clock to am/pm. And I wish there was some help as to how to get the most out of it. When I link to the help function I get a YouTube video on the 10 most beautiful places in the world. Nice video but not at all helpful. I really would like help on how to interpret the data it gives.",
            "I really wanted to like this app as it contains all the features I'm looking for. It's drawback lays in it's sensing of distance traveled and timing. I walk 1.2 miles every morning, which takes me 20 to 25 minutes. I clocked the distance on my car's speedometer so I know it's accurate. When I finished my walk yesterday morning, the readout of this app had registered 10 minutes travel time, and a distance of only .8 miles. Due to this inaccuracy I'm deleting the app."

Also, I have followed it very well. For 40. Days and I have gained 2 pounds. Pretty angry about this.",

I now simply write out my workout for the next day (just because I like to track my weight progress) and follow the macros given for my meals.  Love it!",

The exercises are spelled out with video instruction and audio cues. Easy to use."

The app is very well designed and preforms its function perfectly. Thank you developers for a solid creation.",
            "What an absolute treat to use this app! I find it hilarous that fitbit has put restrictions on the number of apps that i can receive notifications from. This solved all my problems and i would continue using this! Thank you Devs, you're the best!",
            "+1 on this app. The stock Fitbit software on Pixel 3 has issues sending text notifications to the Fitibit Blaze. Phone calls notify properly. Anyhow, I installed Fit Notifications and it addressed the issue. It's been working perfectly for both messages and other applications. An added plus is that it has more flexibility than the Fitbit notifications. I never write reviews but I had to share my joy on this one. Well done!",
            "Loved it for two years, till Android 9. This app worked great at giving me notifications from my SMS messages, WeChat, calendar, phone calls, DOT road alerts. But once my phone recent updates to Android, all I get it \"unknown\" whenever someone calls, don't get SMS messages at all. This really sucks. I know it was Android that caused the problem, but that pretty much broke this app, and made it useless. :("

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Great app - love the scan feature. I do wish it was more intuitive for food entry and that you had the option to change something once you've entered it. I will often enter everything I plan to eat *before* I eat it to make sure I don't inadvertently exceed my allotments, but sometimes don't finish it all. If there is a way to do this I haven't found it, but it could be user error. 🤷‍♀️"

            "There is no sleep timer unless you pay to upgrade. Uninstalled.",
            "Don't like because you have to pay to use the timer. Trying to use it for my baby. Most baby apps come with timer. I'm mostly going to delete this one and go back to what I was using before. Shouldn't of went looking around. Other apps had everything plus timer and baby loved. And for each sound like rain seperate app, ocean seperate app. And so on. This is a RIP off. Keep looking around. There are apps that give all for babies and kids and more.",
            "The newest update said that I needed premium to use the timer. I dont want to pay for premium, or have to have my phone on the charger to use the app. It was a great way to help me sleep. However, I am not going to pay for anything in an app that already has adds. I am rating one star because of the changes. I hate it when apps do this. If it changes back and I find out. I will gladly redownload and give this app the rating I thought it used to deserve, which was 5 stars."

            "Best exercise app to ever have existed. Takes all of the work out of developing routines but still tailored to exactly what you need and want. It's so incredibly customizable they have literally thought of everything. From customizable caloric intake, to weight loss goals, to every exercise and interval amount you could use, visual gifs of the exercises in question, 30 day programs, choose any type of equipment you have and how long/often you want to work out and it will create your plan. 5***",
            "The app has a great concept. I like how it has specific workouts for specific muscle groups. But the problems I encountered right at my first use is it suddenly glitches and exits on its own, saying that app isn't working. It also doesn't have the switch side part when the workout you are about to do needs to be done on both sides of your body, like the side plank. It would also be better if there could be instructions on how to do the workouts properly. It's good, but still need improvements.",
            "Very great work out app you can make the workout harder if you like great work outs love you can choose your area o work out on. The best part os no one is asking for any money from me. A++ for me.",
            "Beauty of an app. Love the new calorie counter, AMAZBALLS! ;) Just wish tht they added a youtube workout section like the Heria Pro app, could really take it to the next level. No limits! P.S. This is the best workout ap ever",

        "description": "SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.\r\n\r\nStep 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. \r\n\r\nStep 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.\r\n\r\nStep 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. \r\n\r\nStep 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?\r\n\r\nUsing SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.\r\n\r\nLearn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. \r\n\r\nThank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!",

These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. <br><br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.<br><br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. <br><br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.<br><br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?<br><br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.<br><br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.<br><br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. <br><br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!",

            "I downloaded this app when it first came out. Ive had no problems with it and it doesn't drain my battery. I truly wish more people would download it, just for the simple fact that it can help each other stay safe. At first I was worried that this was some type of government tracking devise, but it's not, thank God! I truly believe our NC health department is trying to help us remain healthy and I truly appreciate the effort. So far, I've not been in contact with anyone positive and Im thankful!",
            "Little to no impact on my phone performance and battery life. Appears to work as described, but many more people in North Carolina need to install this app. This app can help to slow the spread of Covid-19 by alerting you to early possible exposure to someone who tested positive. This app needs to be promoted more prominently on social media so people will know it's available. I found it by chance on the Google Play app.",
            "I installed it on my Samsung S5 (6.0.1 Marshmallow). I guess it's working, but it has a big flaw: it's a power hog. Until I installed SowCOVIDNC, my phone battery easily lasted a full day. Now I have to recharge by late-afternoon. That's a big problem. Can you please fix it? I'm not going to uninstall it, because it is important. I can live with the power drain, if I have to. But it sure would be a lot better if it didn't drain the battery so rapidly.",
            "Can't enable the app. I downloaded the app then I read how it works then I clicked enable. However it says that there's an internal error and that I should try again. I try again and it keeps saying internal error. It doesn't tell me anything what the problem is. Using a Samsung Galaxy A20 android phone. Would be thankful for any help. Will be checking back. Edit: Thank you for responding. What you told me to do helped tremendously. It works perfectly now.",
            "Excellent and Thank You! I agree with other reviewers, I hope (and will do my part) it is downloaded by as many NC residents as possible. Also - Google's category of \"Health and Fitness\" doesn't apply they need to create a specific Public Safety or Pandemic Level Category, because this app should NOT get bulked in with thousands of fitness and weight trackers and is likely getting lost in the search. Apps like this is essential to keeping us safe, it needs its own Category. Thank you again!"

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

            "Amazing. Couldn't like it more! I like the fact that you can create and record your own music. I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

But it's very hard to find food history to see how to adjust dosing. Food items in the database do odd things when you change serving sizes. Syncing is largely unreliable and often comes a couple of days late. With all of Insulet's money behind this app, I'd expect it to be lots better.",

It feels good to check how much time you work out and how many calories you burn at the end of the day. 5 out of 5.",
            "Love the app! It is super easy to use and has lots of cool features like the tracker and personal walking plan, and reminder. It also tells you how many calories you burn, which I find very cool, cause that motivates me to walk even more, and you basically can track your progress. I think it’s the perfect app for those who want to lose weight but don't like going to the gym. I have also noticed that now I spend more time outside in the fresh air and am even happier. I 100% recommend this app!",
            "Good This is my second day of using the app and I like everything so far. I feel like the app pushes you forward but not too hard. I am starting from almost no experience and this app walks me through everything from warm up to cool down. It tracks my weight loss progress and adjusts to my preferences. Definitely a good alternative to workout, if you’re not that much into exercise."

Also, if I am to get so much ads, I might as well go back to TorrDroid as the ads there are fewer and skippable.",

It doesn't works, when i opened the apps i automatically closes and i reinstalled still doesn't work so i had to delete those apps. I did not found this app useful, i wanted to rate 0 stars, but i can't. When you fix this problem i will download this app!!!",
            "(Still not fixed, clear cache, Uninstall reinstall, power cycle, still cannot remove old torrents) It has an annoying glitch that does not remove torrents, ive contacted support, done all of their fixes and it seems to get worse, only started happening when the new features were introduced",

Also both widgets are way too short - they use very little of the screen height that they take up / occupy.",

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time.

            "I feel like this is a really good app, gives me a little bit of responsibility by waking up my buddy and gets me to go out and do simple but meaningful tasks. It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Unfortunately, like the user below, the scale and app show the weight, but won't show the other bits of info that its meant to and it won't save any results ive read through all the instructions I could find, but nothing works. No wonder it was on sale from $40 to $8! If you are planning on getting 1 to track your goals, I hope you see this first, to avoid the waste of time & money buying one! Highly unlikely though, since you need to buy it to find out what app to get! Highly disappointing!",
            "I have just bought the scales, and followed all instructions. But the scale will show my weight, but won't read anything else. It just comes up with Err X and switches off, I'm unable to save any data whatsoever. Highly frustrating, and unless this issue is fixed, i would not recommend or waste you money.",
            "The app has potential. The history and trend format are bad, and frustrating to use. It would be good to rather display a list of dates with weights and allow people to drill down for more detail on a specific date. Lately it will display my weight on the app but it doesn't seem to record it which makes the app useless and very frustrating to use.",
            "Bit disappointed. I can only get my weight and BMI readings. Following all instructions but cannot get the other readings (bodyfat, hydration, other etc). I get an error message 'Err X' for which there is no advice for. 'Err' says max weight but I'm under 100kg. The measurements do NOT save to the app device. Scales take several taps to turn on also. I'll try again tomorrow otherwise it's going back to Kmart. Hope other people are enjoying their scales. Chur 🤙",
            "Works very very well tracking weight via Bluetooth 👍👌 One issue, it's connection to Google fit. It doesn't work and Google fit doesn't reconise the app automatically or manually adding it.... 👎👎 DEVELOPER take note, and please fix this bug as this feature would be amazing if it worked, making this a really useful app. Thank you ☺️"

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

The app offers you unique 48+ mantas, mudras and meditation techniques for dealing with 48+ types of diseases including chronic and terminal illnesses.\r\n\r\nCompiled by our ancient seers and sages, thousands of years ago, these mantras are powerful sound vibrations that are capable of stimulating certain glands, nerves, energy centres and altering vibrations in every molecule and cell of your body. Each sound has a distinct vibration and energy and hence each mantra has a different effect. As a result a person with any health problem experiences a profound healing effect.  \r\n\r\nMudra vigyan or science of yoga mudras involves simple hand positions or gestures to energise different parts of the body and help to allow flow of prana throughout the system. According to Ayurveda, diseases are caused by lack or excess of any of the five elements – air, fire, water, earth and ether that causes imbalance in the body. The use of mudras directs the flow of energy in a way that balances the five elements and thus facilitates healing.\r\n \r\nIt is said that   a positive state of mind has a positive impact on your body. The root of an illness is in the mind.  Meditation is a powerful tool that helps in clearing your mind from negativity, anxiety, worry and other conflicts. When your mind is totally calm, alert and contented, it drives your body to perform better.  Which is why, in meditation healing happens. Meditation prevents stresses from entering your body system.

Free version works flawlessly, you're not bombarded by incessant ass, and they don't keep the best features behind a paywall; which is the completely CORRECT way to encourage to support you. Plus; your can customize the volume of the rain vs the thunder. You can literally make this app sounds EXACTLY the way it's supposed to.",

            "I would love a few more soundscapes, especially from daytime activities. For example: the wind blowing leaves, background noise could be someone mowing their lawn, occasional slow passing traffic, maybe dog barks off in the distance. The existing ones are so calming I sometimes have difficulty staying awake. If the theme needs to be rain, perhaps peoplevs footsteps in shallow puddles, and a flowing stream, frogs croaking.",
            "Like the app... But I don't like the way that it only has one vibe that you can listen to that's free. And you have to pay for the other ones and it's not even that many of them to pay for. Overall it's a good app because it's relaxing and calming but I wish I had more to choose from.",

            "A nice app with lots of options to customise workouts and reps. Really glad for the voice that announces what move is coming next as I always forget and the beeps for each rep. Has helped tremendously in setting up a simple stretching routine to help with my recovery from a back injury.",

            "At my age and 40 really only concentrated on upper body weight training in past. Thankyou so much for this app! Good option for a simple workout or with an added workout! Life saving stuff, encouraging and easy to follow and stay focused.",
            "I suffer from lower back pain ever since I got sciatica from a back injury. These small workouts actually work better than my rehabilitation workout. A minor delay between the rep countdown and the animation, but better to work at your own pace anyway and do how many you're comfortable doing.",
            "It is a great app to work on all parts of your body. The only disadvantage is that when you want to make your personal plane is gets difficult to order the exercises. I mean moving them up and down one by one is time consuming."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I've been using this app for years, I love it!!!! Whether I'm traveling or just looking for a new meeting to hit, it makes finding and getting to the meeting so much easier. The integration with google maps is extremely helpful and I appreciate the JUST FOR Today reading. I use the Favorites to store meetings I go to out of town. Kiddos to the people who maintain this app!!",
            "I installed the app a couple months ago and it worked fine. But since then I've tried to use it on two other phones, and it refuses to install the meeting files 🙁 It says I have no connection when I have both 4G and WiFi both. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, deleted app info, tried different Wi-Fi's... You name it. It is no use to me, and it's been this way for a couple months. Please fix and I'll up the rating 👍",
            "Awesome app! No adds. There is a bug. When texting someone meeting info, you must manually enter a space between the street address and city. This is simple to fix. Not sure why they haven't, but it's definitely an app I love to use and do so almost every day!",
            "Would give more stars, but not really happy that JFT is showing tomorrow after I read today's ONCE and wont allow me to go \"back\" to today. Other friends at mtgs have the same problem on Android only. Fix that glitch & I'll up the stars. Thanks. Update: the bug's been fixed! 5 stars now!"

            "Good white noise app. Benn using it for months and still don't know the difference between the 3 modes though! Seems to shut off if you keep using you phone for a while after turning on the noise. Don't know if that's a bug in mine or if it's designed like that. It's prefer it didn't though as often I want to keep doing stuff on my phone with the noise on to calm my baby down. Other than that - great little app.",
            "I don't really get it. There are 3 options: Night Sleep, Power Nap, Flight Sleep. When you start any of them, you hear the ocean. If you open the options, there are several other types of sounds (lake, rain, Tibetan bowls, etc.)—but choosing any of them doesn't change anything. You still just hear the ocean. An I missing something? And does it actually require headphones, or is that just a suggestion? (Who wants to wear headphones all night? How can that be comfortable?)",
            "Surprised at how effective this is. Main effect is white noise moving from left to right and back - so simplistic, it's almost silly. Other effects are automatically layered over time and change over time. Seems to work every time I need it. Only complaints are that it does not shot off when earbuds are unplugged and that there is no management available in the notifications.",
            "I find this works well for what I require, there is no one talking therefore no requirement to either get used to the voice. As I always say you have to find a voice that does it for you otherwise it won't do it for you, but I've found that this is superior Unfortunately atm it does stop for no reason before the timer runs out after about 20 minutes",
            "Love this app. It's simple and that's what makes it so appealing especially when you have to use it just before bed. I use the app mostly when I can't get to sleep easily due to stress. Works like a charm! Would definitely recommend it for it's simplicity and effectiveness."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

I like how you make it easy to being imagined. ☆ Inside this app, there's so much life lessons they've (OC's) taught me that my parents or my teacher don't. Thank you for making such a beautiful art. ♡ I still.. collect some money to buy the premium one (haha). I hope it could be great seeing your premium art displayed on my android screen, soon. Stay safe and sound! ✿",
            "I found it boring to be honest. I can see some people may like it. It's a choose your own adventure story. It's written well but often offers choices with only the Illusion of choice. All answers seem to lead to the same thing. In the story some questions the characters ask you it really feels like it's gathering information about you to sell off to advertisers. It asks what your hobbies are etc. I am unsure if this is somehow related to the story later on or not I didn't get very far into it.",

            "I like the food ordering options but other functions are pretty clunky. As far as rewards and needing to save them, why not just have it tied to your phone # instead of having to electronically 'clip it'? I'm turning off push messages too........way too many of them. I get it, you're selling pizza but not everyday is pizza day. Loll",

It appears that other users are having the same problem. For now I have stopped using the app or trying to order pizza. Your loss."
