        "description": "All About Multiple Sclerosis\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been scientifically determined that multiple sclerosis can potentially debilitate a person. This means that the body‚Äôs own immune system attacks the sheath that protects the nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce this sheath is damaged or totally destroyed, the normal communication between the person‚Äôs brain and the rest of the body is interfered. This condition results into the deteriorating of the nerves, a complication that can never be reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIts symptoms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of multiple sclerosis may vary depending on how much damage has occurred to the nerves that are affected. Those who have the severe type of multiple sclerosis can end up being bedridden since their ability to walk or to talk is destroyed.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is very bothersome about these symptoms is that they tend to come and go. This means that they could suddenly arrive and then suddenly disappear for a few months. This is why doctors find it initially difficult to diagnose multiple sclerosis during its early stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple sclerosis symptoms are also usually manifested by people between the ages of twenty and forty. Although multiple sclerosis can happen to anyone from any age, this is the common age range that is affected. Also, according to statistical research, the women are the ones who usually carry this debilitating disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is numbness or fatigue in one limb or both. This kind of weakness usually occurs on just one side of the body at a single time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there have been reports that it could happen to the entire bottom part of the body. This condition is often accompanied with a tingling sensation that is sometimes painful in some parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a partial or a complete visual loss which starts at one time then ends with having pain whenever both eyes move. This condition is given the medical term of optic neuritis. Apart from loss of vision, double vision or blurring of vision can also occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere could also be sensations like electrical shock that occur whenever the head is moved. Tremors also happen with the accompaniment of absence of coordination and imbalanced gait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany who have multiple sclerosis might experience relapses of the symptoms, especially during the early stages of the disorder. This relapsing phase is often followed by partial or complete remission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIts causes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs minimally mentioned, multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. This means that the body‚Äôs immune system attacks its own cells and tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe myelin, which is a protective wall that insulates the nerve fibers within, is damaged in multiple sclerosis. Once it is damaged, foreign substances that are potentially harmful can then freely destroy the open and unprotected nerve fibers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple sclerosis can happen to anyone from any age. However, it has been discovered that it usually occurs to people who are between twenty and forty years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, women are also the ones who usually carry such disease. In fact, women are twice more likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs any other condition, heredity plays an important role. The risk of developing multiple sclerosis is greater for those who have a family history of the disease than for those who do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one of the parents has the disease, then there is a one to three percent possibility that multiple sclerosis may develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to identical twins, things are much more complicated and difficult to ascertain. Identical twins would mean having identical risks, according to some medical scientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the case because a twin who has multiple sclerosis only gives his or her identical twin a thirty percent possibility of having the very same disorder.",

Tremors also happen with the accompaniment of absence of coordination and imbalanced gait.<br><br><br><br>Many who have multiple sclerosis might experience relapses of the symptoms, especially during the early stages of the disorder. This relapsing phase is often followed by partial or complete remission.<br><br><br><br>Its causes<br><br><br><br>As minimally mentioned, multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. This means that the body‚Äôs immune system attacks its own cells and tissues.<br><br><br><br>The myelin, which is a protective wall that insulates the nerve fibers within, is damaged in multiple sclerosis. Once it is damaged, foreign substances that are potentially harmful can then freely destroy the open and unprotected nerve fibers.<br><br><br><br>Multiple sclerosis can happen to anyone from any age. However, it has been discovered that it usually occurs to people who are between twenty and forty years of age.<br><br><br><br>As mentioned, women are also the ones who usually carry such disease. In fact, women are twice more likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.<br><br><br><br>As any other condition, heredity plays an important role. The risk of developing multiple sclerosis is greater for those who have a family history of the disease than for those who do not.<br><br><br><br>If one of the parents has the disease, then there is a one to three percent possibility that multiple sclerosis may develop.<br><br><br><br>When it comes to identical twins, things are much more complicated and difficult to ascertain. Identical twins would mean having identical risks, according to some medical scientists.<br><br><br><br>However, this is not the case because a twin who has multiple sclerosis only gives his or her identical twin a thirty percent possibility of having the very same disorder.",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team üôèüèªü•∞"

            "This app was great at first, but then the alarm stopped. Then it started repeating injection sites, i injected the same area too many times due to the app. i have now gone back to manual tracking as the app is unreliable. The alarm doesn't work and the tracking is off. You can scroll ahead to see up coming injection sites, but I would like to scroll back and see previous sites so I don't accidentally inject twice. It woild also be nice to skip a site and have the app suggest a new site.",
            "I really like this app, it helps me keep track of my daily injection sites and the alarms work well. I also really appreciate the supply reminder. The only complaints I have are that the note section is not in English and the rotation site glitches sometimes so its reading the incorrect injection site.",
            "Completely useless. You cant change where you gave the shot or make any notes on side effects. You have to use another app to keep track of any other meds. Just a complete waste of time trying to use this",
            "I didn't get past programming my injection sites because the belly isn't listed.",
            "This is a great app, it really helps me to remember what area is inject myself, plus it's a timer."

Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

To demonstrate this equivalence, BeCare is currently sponsoring a large clinical trial that is being conducted in a major hospital system. The data that the BeCare MS Link App collects is intended to be comparable to the functional data captured by the EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of people with MS and is widely accepted as a valid tool to clinically measure and assess the level of functioning for individuals diagnosed with MS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to storing functional data on the mobile device, the BeCare Link App is also part of larger process which permanently stores and analyzes this data in the BeCare Link Cloud, through the utilization of machine learning algorithms (MLA‚Äôs). MLA‚Äôs are implemented to produce an EDSS score for each user that is subject to fluctuation over time. Because BeCare Link clinical researchers will be able to analyze data from all users in an aggregate, quantitative process, study participants will be contributing to future advancements of medical treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.\r\n\r\nEach time participants connect to the BeCare Link App, a new session is established that can last several hours. After the user completes a substantive number of tasks and activities, a new EDSS score is generated for that session. This EDSS score provided by the clinical trial is compared to EDSS scores that have been previously calculated by healthcare professionals and is then evaluated for accuracy. At any time, BeCare Link app users can view an accumulative history of their performance data in the Readings portion of the app, as well as any other information provided through their voluntary participation, by navigating through the app.\r\n\r\nBeCare MS Link Mobile App\r\n\r\nThe BeCare MS Link mobile app guides the participant to conduct tasks and answer status questions about their symptoms to deliver information tantamount to current gold standards used in clinical studies, applicable to further understanding of MS.\r\n\r\nEach activity on the MS Link mobile app has a unique sequence of steps the user must complete that correspond to standard functional tests typically performed by clinicians during neurological assessments. These functions are accomplished through the use the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetic sensors in the participant‚Äôs phone that determine when the person makes a tilting motion, takes a step, alters their position, or moves their arms.\r\n\r\nFor example, the App activity initiated by selecting \"Transcription Test\" from the Wellness Workout landing page measures Central Auditory Processing, or the ability to understand speech. Other activities measured by the BeCare MS Link App include standard motor skills through activities such as walking (25 Steps, 6 Minute Walk), repetitive arm movements (Arm Elevation), or the TUG test, which involves transitioning from a seated position, to standing, walking, and then returning to the starting point.\r\n\r\nFor each of the activities users complete, the BeCare Link App saves data corresponding to each completed activity on the mobile device. When an internet or WIFI connection from the mobile device to the BeCare Link Cloud becomes available, the BeCare Link App uploads an encrypted representation of the data to the BeCare Link Cloud, where the data is classified by the MLAs to produce an EDSS score. The EDSS scores are kept available so that users can view their historical performance and identify if any changes in their performance history are correlative to the progression of their MS.",

            "My true purpose for trying this app was to help with digestive issues I've experienced for the past two years. Figured, why not? This helps! Matter of fact, I would rate it top 3 of what is putting my system back on track. I've been using this app for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it. As of right now, at almost 50 and normal weight, my pelvic muscles are on point. ( Sorry if that sounds awkward.) This app keeps me focused and, oftentimes, I meditate through these exercises.",
            "Simple, effective. This has 2 simple types of Kegel exercises, performed after each other. It builds repetition and time slowly each day. Perfect for post hysterectomy. It gives a discreet reminder on my phone. I have the app set to vibrate times during exercises so I can close my eyes and concentrate rather than counting or watching clock. I HIGHLY recommend.",
            "I love this I have tried doing legal excercise on my own but would not feel like I was doing them correctly. This app shows me how to make progress. I have been doing this for about a week and can feel the muscles getting a little toner I guess you would say. I am not sure how to say it. I just feel it working",
            "I like the exercises in this app for basic squeeze-release kegels, and that they slowly progress each day without you having to advanced them, much as a personal trainer would do. My only two gripes so far after using it for a few days, and why it fell short of five stars, are that I wish there was at count down before beginning the exercises like 3-2-1-go, and I wish you could set reminders to do the exercises multiple times a day.",
            "Ads are not intrusive at all. Design of app good. Can do anywhere and noone knows what you're doing. The graph is encouraging to try and get yourself up the levels! Straightforward; thank you!"

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

Each session has a specific level of exercise, according to a specially prepared rehabilitation program.

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

I do hope to see some updates, maybe icon choices between breakfast, lunch and dinner to better distinguish between the three instead of the same icon. Maybe a choice of colors. A little bit would go a long way to making this app great.",
            "A simple app for logging meals, with a pleasing design. But there should be a way to set the time to 12H instead of 24H. For instance my entry may say 2:15 PM, but when viewing the diary feed it's listed as 14:15. There are no settings or preferences. Also agree with another reviewer that a calendar view for jumping to specific days would be nice.",
            "The free version only gives you a 7 day history. I'm in the middle of unpleasant intolerance symptoms so seeing my logs is imperative and my health depends on it. I don't want to bounce between a lot of apps or reenter info across them. Please consider another barrier, even ads. If I remember this app I might consider trying it when I'm not feeling sick, but this app is designed for sick people, so... It's a bummer because the interface is nice and you can't go wrong with googly eyes.",

I can add and edit things that I forgot and it's nice to have a scale of how bad the symptoms were for each event. The only thing I would love to see to improve it would be some sort of graph or chart as part of the report showing any patterns instead of having to read back through all of my entries to see if I can find any links."

Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "This game is really really nostalgic, I've been playing since 2012 alright, but you guys really really need to fix these bugs and stuff that's making the game suck. You can't see your friends movies anymore, your friends pictures, the statuses are just for Nova and Zac, and the game lags. Like really bad. But, otherwise this game brings back memories.",
            "I love this game!! But it does have some problems. I think you should be able to earn diamonds just like you can earn fame and starcoins. My account got hacked 6 different times so I feel like there should be more protection than what they have. The game is so fun and addictive though I get stuck playing for hours!!!!!",
            "As much as I love this game there's a lot of bugs that need to be fixed no one plays the games anymore because you don't get rewards, my game keep glitching out even though WiFi bars are full, and for some reason I get a message saying its getting late chat opens in 1 hour, im 18 this doesn't happen to my 12 year old sister. But over all this game is fun but needs some work done.",
            "the app is horrible. it's so sensitive to everything. you can type one number and get locked. and how do I know ? bc I did. I typed the number 5 and git locked for \"sharing password\" the game needs to grow up and I don't recommend it to anyone it's a waste of time and money. and they don't refund you your money when they lock your account. just bad overall.",
            "So I've been playing this game for a long time on pc and mobile but the thing is on mobile I can't log out or anything because of the black bar. I've tried it on a different phone (Samsung) it was fine no bar or anything everything worked but the phone I mainly use (Motorola) it's like the screen is slight moved to the right so it's not fully on the screen which makes it hard for me to log out, exit profiles or movies. For msp 2 I have no problems with any of these things."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you‚Äôll enter your password, and then you‚Äôll be asked for an additional way to prove it‚Äôs really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app.‚ÄØThe one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don‚Äôt have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn‚Äôt require you to be connected to a network, and it won‚Äôt drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you‚Äôll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you‚Äôll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

            "This app is awesome if you forget your passwords frequently or want to add an extra layer of security.. The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.",
            "Amazing app, I really appreciate how easy it is to backup your information so when U get a New Phone, it is so much easier to reinstall with all your info. Let me say one thing, without that backup, it is a BE'ATCH to get authentication up‚¨Ü & running again with all your compatible apps! It is very Time Consuming without that Great Backup Feature!!! My only downfall, I am having big problems with PayPal... it is Never the right Code... WHY‚ùì It is driving me insane & it is really a problem for me‚ùó",
            "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly for Microsoft accounts, and is acceptable for others. I can't have all the codes showing at once, which means an extra tap each time I go to use the app, and I'd like to be able to customise icons for accounts to make it easier to spot the one I'm after. Other than minor niggles, I'm good.",
            "I have no choice but to use this app for my organization, but recently it began requiring me to \"unlock\" the app. I had no idea how to do this so I had to Google for an answer. Turns out you have to use your mobile PIN or biometric to unlock the app. I feel like my phone PIN has been compromised and provided to Microsoft. Unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the usage reporting that is enabled by default that I discovered when turning off this unlock feature. Sorry Microsoft, I do not trust you.",
            "I recommend this application. It is convenient to keep your account security verification code secure. When you login, it ensure that no one will login to your account without your permission. I also love this app more than google authentication. You can backup your info link with your email. It is very good when compare to other authentication app."

Office Transfer is also a great tool built in to the app, which allows for fast media & file transfers between the phone and PC. Would recommend this app 100%.",

And it doesn't have the discard option when you don't want to save a document. Tapping on texts zooms in and out and doesn't point to where I want to type. The app also occupies too much storage in my device. (500 Mb).",

This usually happens when I use word, or lens for some time. So please fix this. Or please add a auto save feature. And I can't find a scroll button in the .ppt files. So please add this. So I can scroll down slides very fast when I am not in slideshow.",
            "This Office application will not work properly after only a few days of use. I am unable to open this Office app on my Samsung Chromebook. The app opens for only a few seconds, then closes without notice. I have tried uninstalling the app, then reinstalling the app, but this action did not correct the issue. This is extremely frustrating and disappointing due to my reliance on this app to complete undergraduate coursework in Office type documents. I am unable to retrieve my documents.",
            "Impossible To Keep Same \"Theme Font\". I'm typing up songs I write. It keeps changing the Font of every single word; I must go back & put in smaller font so my words fit page. I changed over from \"Docs\" as the margins are better with Office, but I may go back. Office keeps putting a period after each Guitar chord (Letter) I write above words; Docs does same thing.

There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki‚Äôs a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that‚Äôs just how it is. And Poi? He‚Äôs his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they‚Äôll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don‚Äôt mess with her. And Marina, she‚Äôs as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. <br><br>Also, there‚Äôs the art. You won‚Äôt believe the art in these levels - it‚Äôs like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. <br><br>There you have it. Download this one game today, and you won‚Äôt be searching the app store for much anymore.<br><br>Privacy Policy:<br>http://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

It disconnects for no reason, says that you aren't on the same network when you are, etc. I found a fix for this by restarting the app on pc but now that doesn't work anymore because I can't even open the app. Everytime I try to open it(on pc) it starts with the normal loading screen but then it just minimizes itself and I can't open it again.

I don't normally take the time to review apps, but this one is a terrible experience the whole way through. Seeing \"Rate us 5 stars\" at the top of the system menu was what pushed me to it."

Has ads that cannot be closed, so there is no way to use this app. When I click on the ad it redirects me to a page that days I installed something with a weird name. Very suspicious. Even then, the ad doesn't close. So there's literally no way to get to the editor.",
            "Surprisingly effective if used in moderation. Need to be careful to avoid arms if shaping a waist, but if used for small adjustments it looks very natural. The pop-up ads for other apps are annoying, but it's a free app, so perhaps shouldn't complain - but it typically takes 10+ clicks to exit the App.",
            "High potential, but creates pixelated photo after a few edits. The interface is really easy to use and the editing is robust, but like I said, the quality of the resultant photo is severely degraded after a few layers of edits, for some reason.",
            "Wonderful and wow!. It is really a surprise that I can change the shape of my body without having to do exercise. It is rather convenient when I can't exercise for producing great photos",
            "I think that this is great, I got it to make my breasts look bigger and it works fantastic. I'm really happy but..I gavi it 4 stars because it would be great to not have the watermark there. I mean if I'm gonna post it then I wouldn't want anybody calling me out for body editing. I mean yeah I can just crop the watermark out but, still. I think that if ya'll remove the watermark then I will give it 5 stars, and if u want 5 stars you should remove it üòä"

One can only listen and not speak well on a Teams call while using the mobile app. Also when searching for a message, it takes to the latest messages in the conversation and not that particular message being searched. Works on heavy data transfer.",

Since the starting of this week, there is a glitch for the teachers in the school that disallows them to join the meeting and sometimes even the app. I have given it Four stars cause it is very annoying and we students can't study properly. If this situation is fixed I will give it a five I swear.",
            "Great Online Meeting App.. But there is this thing that I would like to request the developers to add in Teams that there should be an option to delete an entire conversation with a specific person. We have to delete every single message to vanish the whole chat. Try to add this feature also to make it work more flexibly Overall nice application.. keep it up üëçüèªü§üüèª",
            "Teams is a good app. But there is a problem with the app. The app was fine but after the latest update, I can't join any meeting. I have a stable network. I tried signing out and signing in, but that also didn't work. Whenever I click on join button, it is showing that, \"Your call dropped and we couldn't reconnect\". So, I deleted it and installed an old problem free version. Edited : Now there is no problem after updating to the latest version. Thanks for solving the issues."

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats ¬£7 a month, over ¬£80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language! Even those who speak a second language for many years still make mistakes. Who cares if people go too fast? Worry about those who don't and use the app appropriately]!]"

            "Such a shame. This app was amazing, but the latest update has messed everything up. Settings are clunky, sound effects are forced on you that make a recording sound ridiculous, and the video effects on group collaborations are awful. Finished recordings often end up completely different to what you see during the preview. You've taken away all the joy of this as a musical singing app. It doesn't feel like any testing was done before releasing this latest update. Poor.",
            "Dear team smule, after the recent update, the lovely feel of the app is lost. To describe briefly, the settings in terms of reverb, room etc, are very difficult to adjust, and I have to repeatedly tap super studio, and these features just don't open up. What happened to the good old app..!! Why give us the updates which don't work? All the fun is lost now. My friends who use the app have similar issues. Kindly look into the matter and set it right please.",
            "I used to use this app a lot when I was a teenager just to entertain myself and it used to be all free and you did not need to buy a VIP subscription just to perform a solo song. This app has become absolutely atrocious and unusable. There is another app like this that I personally believe is much better, free, and doesn't have intrusive ads. They might not have the group option, but at least I don't pay $20 a month to be able to sing a solo. Obvious cash grab update",
            "It's unfortunate that you can't pick your voice effect when joining others, can't change visual effects, and it just sounds off now. Whenever you record if you click out of the voice effect to adjust volume of your voice you CAN NOT go back to the effects. It needs fixed. Used to use it a while ago and recently got back on. Glad I only subscribed to one month VIP instead of committing to a full year again. I will say I like the globe and seeing where the other person is joining from.",
            "I will change my rating if they fix the issues with the app. The recent update messed everything up for me, not sure if its because I have a Samsung. Anyways, I can't make videos anymore because the audio and video don't match like others have said. I also dont like the new options and singing styles. They made everything too complicated. Its not fun anymore which makes me sad. I used to love this app, but the new version is terrible. Please fix it!"

            "My favorite game, I literally deleted my other games because this is the only one I play now, I love it so much. Everything from how positive it is, to the perfectly fitting audio that plays. I love how simple and easy going this game is and I love how this games helps you succeed. The levels where you can locate items are super fun as well, recommending this game to everyone I know literally!!",
            "Caution. This game is really nicely crafted, very visually rich, and enjoyable to play from levels 1-10. After this, things start to go absolutely mental. There is pop-up after pop-up, harassing you about another new feature. You quickly get to a point where you're bamboozled - everything on the screen is shouting at you. This appears to be by design, hyper confusion and attention hijacking to nurture addiction. This app is nefarious and should be enjoyed only with huge restraint.",
            "Never log into Facebook. It causes you to lose the prizes from any contest you won. I had tons of things coming from a dots race and they vanished the second it connected to Facebook. Also, the game freezes and crashes a lot when watching videos to get a bonus box. You have to be patient when you open the app. It can take over five minutes to come up.",
            "Honestly was obsessed with this game for awhile, but they made a bunch of updates and now every time you view the map about four or five different windows pop up to tell you about the different games. It used to just be the daily bonus. Tired of exiting out of a bunch of stupid notifications just to be able to click on the game I want. They ruined a good thing.",
            "You get to a certain point and you can't win anything without spending money. With prices on everything else in life steadily increasing the last thing I wanna spend money on is a silly phone game. If you could just spend money once or twice, maybe no big deal. But you have to constantly spend money to get perks to help you thru the levels and clearly this is by design. It's a really cool game, and very disappointing to have to delete, but I'm just not up for money hungry games like this."

I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",
            "I've had continuous problems with pandora since I got it. I download songs and playlists, then when I try to play them, it says I haven't downloaded them. It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",
            "I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years now. I love no ads. Since Last update, Pandora just stops working and closes. I thought it was my phone. Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",
            "Used to work great but now it will shuffle through all songs without playing them , the songs will pop up then the next one will pop up while no music is heard or can be played. I've uninstalled multiple times and can't figure out the issue. I want my refund back because I can't use the app or listen to the song I want"

            "Useless to install. There are not include at least 1 week trail period. It should pay before you start and before that they collect all detail about you. So if you check this app, after install and go to app settings and give no internet acceas and then try the app. But you have to pay before using it.",
            "Shouldve given an option for a 3 or 7 day trial. I subscribe and accidently chosen the 1 year plan which cost sgd44. 90 and i cant get a refund. If theres a trial. People should be charged oncd the trial end. People also should be able to see how this app works. Really disappointed. App sucks and no refund, at least give back half of the payment. Its sgd44. 90. And im not going to use the app. üëéüèº",
            "Downloaded it, and what rubbish. The workout is a joke. I paid 11euro and won't be using it at all. subscription cancelled automatically.",
            "I love it. The only thing I wish got updated/ fixed is that when I do extra workouts, I wish it would count/record it & that It doesnt record the work outs I do after 12am. Sometimes i only have time to work 11p-1a. But besides that I feel motivated,& since its split in 7min-12mins, I dont feel like it takes up my day or that Im really doing much. I feel like I have so much more energy. I highly recommend fit coach, especially if you are starting to get in shape(that's where I am at)",
            "This app is terrible. I made the mistake of buying into this before checking it out and I cant get a refund. There is no support for the exercises and the menu options have no proteins at all so unless you are a vegetarian this is terrible. I had my data exported to me and it all says \"none\" even though I entered all my info. Do not waste your time or money on this garbage. Im out $30 and learned a valuable lessen to learn more before investing. This app doesn't even deserve 1 star!!!"

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",
            "Game is great.. expensive if you want to keep up...but it never ever connects for me the 1st time . and it's not my interent it's your server...One time I have to use my interent then I have to use my data..and most times I have to go back and forth 3 or 4 times to see which it will take...and this is every single day a few times a day .it never is the same and takes forever to load when it finally gets working.. but I do love the game! I am addicted just wish you would fix those 2 things..."

When I try and go to \"My Page\" I keep getting \"SERVER ERROR (0) TRY AGAIN LATER\" I HAVE \"TRIED AGAIN LATER\" FOR OVER A YEAR! FIX YOU APP! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE TO NOT WORK ON PHONES THAT COST $1,299.99! UNACCEPTABLE! I have had my Note 20 Ultra since release and after contacting Samsung MULTIPLE TIMES. It STILL DOES NOT WORK! UNACCEPTABLE!",
            "Still no resolution over 4 months: Displays my galaxy s20plus warenty is rejected after review using this app. I called Samsung multiple times to have this corrected and they still don't have any idea how to fix this. They say my warenty should not be rejected. This is very disturbing my warenty status still showing its rejected since the beginning of July and no one at samsung knows what to do to fix the samsung members app?? This shouldn't be so difficult to correct.",
            "Why doesn't this app help with finding my phone via chat as my phone can't be reached? I was told to stay online as he was rerouting me to someone that can help, that was 30 minutes ago so I copied it all as no way to get a transcript.",
            "Hardware test may be useful, but I would trust 3rd party software more. otherwise I find this app mostly useless. I said it in 2017 and I'm saying now in 2020.",
            "Many thanks to Samsung for creating such a beautiful app. The Galaxy Store is even more beautiful than the Play Store. But the Galaxy Store needs more big updates. So that everything can be found beautifully in one search."

I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

The email will be instantly available in Outlook online, but can take up to 5 minutes to load in mobile. The app sends notifications for meetings 15 minutes in advance, but clearing the notification in any way just results in the app resending the notification. Oh, it does the same thing with \"meeting has ended\" notifications. Atrocious app design.",
            "On my old Samsung phone I had the outlook app and NEVER had problems with it. I have had a new phone for 2 weeks and this app has had endless problems. It freezes, it doesn't load emails, it won't send emails and every variation in between. I have followed online suggestions to clear the cache and data and yes the problem is solved for no more than 1 day. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app and again the problem is solved for a day and then back to having the same issues. Woeful!",
            "Whilst I love the features of Ms Outlook, the app has pitfalls. I will receive a notification of a new email, click to review said email and it will be no where to be found. Refresh, refresh, nothing! However, if I go on the desktop web version I will see everything as it is to date. ... This app defeats the purpose of having a mobile service if I always have to draw for my laptop to review emails.",
            "This version of Outlook (mobile, Android) seems appropriately scaled down to suit small screen and \"keyboard\" use and appears to have been optimised for email. Most (or maybe all?) of its original functionality is there, but some features might need a bit of hunting, until you learn how to find them. . Great to be able to use full strength email via phone, with that robust corporate look & feel that Outlook is known for."

            "Wow! I am so impressed with this App! It's very easy to use. It shows you how to do the exercises and it even counts the seconds for you!!! It's definitely motivating! Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! üôÇ",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! üëç",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high ratingüòÇ Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent üòã and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever. And BTW Name's SIZZLE 13 years old üòÅ ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",
            "If I said thanks then this is not enough and it will never be enough. By all means, this app is remarkable and so useful. Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

When I sing, I hear my voice but it's to slow for the song. It has a second relapse. You keep updating changes and once upon a time I could fix it. Now I can't. I am not paying my monthly subscription until this is fixed on your side.",

            "5 stars, much better than Smule in my opinion! The people are so nice, and getting VIP here is so worth it! A bazillion songs to pick from, each one is amazing quality! Thank you for this awesome app! I will add, this app is hard to wrap your head around, but it took me about a day to figure it out.",
            "This app is indeed for singing but sometimes if we wanna sing the songs we like why do we need to become VIP. Can't we just sing without paying money. Coz to become VIP we need to pay. So sometimes it's very annoying. But this app is good too. I have nothing to say more but please remove the VIP system to select the song. It is so frustrating.",
            "I have no idea what happened.... The song lyrics have been cut like a lot... And usually there are a report button but I cant seem to find it at all and I believe that you take it out... So please please fix it... I love your app, i been using this app for long time already! Please do something about it"

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",
            "Yelp has gotten worse then GOOGLE search when it comes to searching for the nearest business you search for. Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results! I hope everyone who screwed up the yelp app to make more money instead of being actually a useful app dies of a horrible disease!"

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ‚ù§Ô∏è I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap üòâ ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from \"my day\". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",
            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

            "I love this editor, it's easy to use, doesn't crash like others I have tried. The 4 instead of 5 stars is simply because of the time it takes to process the final video. Other apps for a 5 minute video takes around 5-7 minutes, this one took 30 minutes, which to me is far too long. Especially when some of my videos will be at least 15 minutes long. I'm dreading the wait on those ones.",
            "Awesome easy to use video editor! Many great features. I accessed and edited right from the videos on my Android phone! Others I tried were awkward and not as many simple to use features. Try it out and 0lay around with the music and effects , just to name two out of dozens. You'll love it! No, I don't work for the developer! LolüòÅ",
            "This is great app. No watermarks and excellent editing software capabilities. Easily rivals computer editing software. My only problem is there's no backspace or Ctrl+Z (however you wanna say it) so if you make a mistake, you can't undo it. Please add one and this will be my new favourite editing app. It's also user friendly! :D highly recommend",
            "I've used it once so far but it is very handy. It has variety of music and I read the option to even put your own. It allows you to add to your photos as text, transitions, music, and many other things!! What I had used was ALL FREE. Definitely recommend. There are adds but eh everything has ads now-a-days",
            "It's actually nice and user friendly specially for the ones who aren't that 'techy' . However, there was one problem that I faced which was that when you try to add any media at the starting of the video once it has been made, the whole audio that is attached to the previous media moves in front and leading to all the audios to move ahead. When you try to push the audio back it actually kind of gets trimmed."

            "The app opens and allows me to fill in my pre-made forms. The problem is I can't 'save as' to a different file name within the app which is stopping me from easily reusing the form. I can't even rename a file within the app! If it doesn't get resolved soon I'll have to stop my subscription. Edit: Also urgently needed is the option to 'flatten' documents so as filled in forms can't be changed by someone else later. Even free apps allow this. Now cancelled my subscription until Adobe sort this.",
            "This is useful for editing PDF files i have to edit. But there is some problems that makes it annoying to use: 1.using Fill and Sign Text sometimes undoes itself for no reason. So you must save alot of times which is annoying. 2 sometimes saving also undoes some text 3 there is no copy and paste (well you can paste but you cannot select a text to copy it.)",
            "Great extension of the powerful desktop application. The PDF ecosystem is mature and well functioning. There is just no way around Adobe if you want to get the best out of it, especially on the creation side. But seriously, make your applications faster again. They are becoming bloated and slow.",
            "Very convenient though the Adobe Acrobat I love PDFs makes it easier to print and keep on my papers without losing them except for when I have my other account I can't get into it I need all those documents you know what I can do other than that I love it no complaints here really keep up the good work",
            "2020.10.28 redownloaded too see: it's still doing it. Whatever update you guys made this year anything I've downloaded the page gets cut off when you zoom in on reading mode, it's highly annoying - unreadable! I've sent reports and nothing got fixed yet!"

            "UI has confusing layout. Political posturing on the front page but no 'check in' button to be seen. Cancels reservations over BS \"identity verification\" or something with two days of notice. I have verified ID in app and 6 stays, only thing that happened is my card blocked an attempted charge one time. I verified that card and nope, still denied. Support claims the host rejected my request, they are lying. I have two days to find something else and my car was just totaled. These dinks unreliable",
            "We have used Airbnb many times both for overnight stays and experiences. The site itself is ready to use and accurate. I appreciate the feature that shows what the total will be because sometimes cleaning fees are extreme and a person needs to know that before they commit. I also like when there is clarity about specific cancellation fees for each location.",
            "Today I am very pissed off. I booked a location through this app about a week ago and today I am trying to make another reservation and they are saying my account has been locked for security proposes. Every time I try to review my account to it sends me back to the same log in screen. There is no number to call and fix the problem and I can't get around the log in screen.",
            "I have been using Airbnb application for more than three years and the fact that it has the same bugs from time to time is unacceptable. The switch account button appears and disappears. Even when it \"decides\" to appear some of the times it does not \"remember\" the codes of the switched account. But to make it even better after I log in to the other account I see in the listings panel listings of the previous account I just logged out. If I had space I would write more. Totally unprofessional.",
            "I love the idea, and regularly use Airbnb, but I'm keen to jump ship for the first competitor who allows me to access the original posting for the booked trips within the app. I find it incredibly irksome to be forced to a computer for one of the most frequently desired actions that logically should be available in the app. I often need to revisit to confirm details from the pictures etc but you simply can't here. If it wasn't for communicating with hosts, I'd uninstall and do desktop only."

            "Sometimes app do not sync with watch. I need my data back. I use to do 10-15K for Oct 2020. All of a sudden I could not see 10k being tracked. I could not contact customer service as there seems to be no hotline or whatsapp help. Example: I was about 7500steps until 11.30pm and I ran 2.36kms which is more than 3000 steps for sure and that did not sync to health app. This is totally frustrating.looks like a bug. I need it to be fixed. Calories also did not sync properly.",
            "Not much user friendly to use, Bluetooth does not auto connect, it does not shows in scan,device name is not shown in bluetooth scan list but still it connect ,I guess that's a bug to be solved,Cannot see data in app offline you need to manually connect even if its paired .App does not open offline.Most of the Honor watch ES features are not shown in app,require to update features,Need lot of improvement as compared to other Health apps.After that it can be eligible for 5 star rating",
            "I would really appreciate an easy way to export the data in a standard file format like csv or xml or gpx in case of tracks. Transfer of tracks from the GT2 watch to this app is very scetchy. The watch appears to register gps signals ok but only a small part of these data gdts transferred to the app. As many others i would like to be able to deselect step counting devices e.g. when carryimg both a watch and a phone. What is really ennoying is that max heart rate is consistently reset to 190",
            "Very Poor app and watch experience coming from Garmin. I REALLY regret going backwards to Huewel. I now have my time wasted to sell and migrate back, the watch features could be good, if you could export data to a useable app I would probably still keep the system. Happy with the way the watch looks like overall EXTREMELY DISSAPPONTED about everything else. UPDATE I've now bought a Garmin and once it arrives life will soon be good again",
            "Still there's no option to chose the source of step count, the app automatically merges data from phone and the band. This is extremely inaccurate! Tons of people complain about this missing feature for YEARS! This could be fixed easily, yet Huawei still don't care about the feedback of their customers. Shame on you! Guess what? Never gonna spend money on Huawei products because of 0 customer support."

It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media playerüòü Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

Also, organizing them into sections is a good feature as well. That way i feel i can see all my new years resolution and the steps that i must take to achieve them and drag and drop this step to do today and that step to do tomorrow.",
            "Many errors, the app is good but sometimes with the recurrent task do not work when I use desktop app it do not sync well and I lose many task and this is unpleasant. Pay for this app with this errors is a bad idea. I do no feel secure with app I lose taks and time. I hope the app get better. And the plan my day would be good if add the tasks in someday",
            "This still works pretty well, but I'm not a fan of the updated widget not listing tasks chronologically. Edit: Nevermind, the sort order can be changed through the app. Thanks to the dev who pointed this out to me. You and your app have been helpful :)",
            "I love this app and use it in preference to my inbuilt calendars because it is so user-friendly and reminders really stand out. It does not seem to have any impact on my overall storage either - getting to be a problem for me. Really useful.",
            "I've removed all my other planner/list/grocery/schedule apps. I used to have so many for different things, but this app has it all! And it's so sleek and simple! I absolutely love it! And I'm looking forward to a free dark theme in the future, it's all I miss!"

            "I loved the game at first I even made it to level 50. However, after months of playing the game investing my time and money it rebooted and made me start over from level 1. They took away my home and Sims family. I was so disappointed. They have since fixed this problem and returned my level and items. I love this game.",
            "Ok. I like this game. But one thing that i really don't like is that they don't notify us of new updates in the game. I would have to go to playstore everytime i suspect there's new updates. Sometimes i would have missed more than a week during an event before i update and i miss good products. So I really hope they would change that and notify us within the game. Otherwise i love it.",
            "I love the game but some things are still quite annoying in it, like the challenges, some are impossible to get unless you make use of real money to purchase sim cash. It think they should make the challenges quite easier to win reward becos some people can't always afford that. I am also hoping to see pets and cars in the game. By the way nice one EA and Maxis",
            "Quite good mobile adaptation of The Sims game. Enjoyable. -- Problem though: My Sim is female but Izzy designed male clothes for me on the first try, and still male on the second try. My starter Fashion Gems all wasted since females can't wear male clothes. Suggestions: 1) make Izzy able to detect the current Sim's gender or allow us to choose. 2) State the requirements of player's name so that we don't have to keep guessing why it gets rejected.",
            "Have all sims in collection. All great only complaint in this game is the loading and the none selling of items in storage.Be good if could add more sims. Over all great game. Am enjoying it. If the situations were resolved i would give a 5 stars. cheers.."

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

It runs properly, is decently clear on what everything does, and having the peace of mind that my photos are safe is nice. On the other hand, on another device, this app crashes every time I try to move photos to a different app, is slow when doing anything else, and ends up wasting my time.",
            "So far I am LOVING THIS!!! I have only just begun using OneDrive, not knowing entirely what it was to begin with. Now I look for it wherever I am. I can open ANY file from pretty much ANY device! Word, power point, excel, etc.! I find that impressive. Especially since it's Microsoft. Like, I think Google tried to do the same thing but something just doesn't feel right over there. This is where it's at. Hands down. So far I highly recommend.",
            "I don't understand what's happend with this app. It worked perfectly fine and then Samsung backup switched to using one drive and it just isn't uploading anything right, it's not uploaded and new pictures from the last month since it change apart from some pictures from a year ago. Then it's saying it can no longer back up from and SD card? There doesn't appear to be anyway to change back and it's not clear what I actually have backed up now. So disappointed.",
            "Setup trying, should be made easier. Sometimes it takes days for uploads. Amazon is good for auto uploads. Making sub- albums is nonexistent (I used to keep info on leases, rent receipts, complaints, etc. in separate albums then group them under 1 album). Even Google changed that capability. I can't deal with these egomaniacs deciding what to do with my pics.",
            "Works ok except one annoying issue. The file dates displayed appear to be the dates the file was initially created and not the date the file was modified/synced. You cannot tell if file is modified until you open and inspect it. This problem is unique to Android version. Works correctly on all other OneDrive apps on other platforms (IOS, Windows, etc)."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.üëà",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

I will always use band for any group stuff I may have.",

If we have multiple calendars created for different purposes, it would be nice to be able to declutter the agenda view by hiding events from irrelevant calendars. Also, please let us specify an individual calendar (when there are multiple) from a specific band when we are creating a widget. Thank you, developers!",

            "It's alright. I switched to Deezer to try it out and although I'm not hating it, I'm not loving it either. The most annoying thing so far that I've came across is the queue list. I do not understand why when I add a song to queue, it adds it to the bottom of an already preloaded list? It's really annoying. If I'm adding songs to queue, I want to listen to those songs after the current one finishes not random 20 songs that Deezer has decided to put in there before my ones. Edit: I do have Premium",
            "The music reccomendation and mixes are absolutely awful. The \"Flow\" mix keeps repeating the same songs instead of letting me explore music. But the worst part is the network issues - there were so many times the songs just wouldn't load (while other apps work just fine so its not my network thats the issue). In my opinion Deezer is just a low-quality Spotify imitation.",
            "Rated 2 because I use the download functionality to be able to have local copies of songs due to poor mobile reception around where I live. However, even though songs are downloaded, deezer won't load the downloaded playlist with poor mobile reception, so the functionality is useless to me. Means everytime I open the app and go to play songs I can't until I get reception again. Spotify, and apple music both work correctly, so switching back. Edit in response to reply: not device related",
            "Good selection, but hard to navigate to music you can \"download\", which you actually can not download to your device at all, even as a premium subscriber. If I pay for premium service, I should be able to download music to my device (I wouldn't have a problem with the download self deleting every so often), so I can play through my own music player. I can not play through my Kenwood Weblink, or my Pioneer Weblink, for display purposes, or to overlay my Navigation System. If so would rate 5 star",
            "This is my 4th review, after this I am not gonna pay for this app. As I am writing this my eyes are about to close and Deezer has still been able to load my playlist (as usual) and when it does most of my songs are skipping like a broken disc, the development team isn't seem to be doing any fixes. I used to love this app but it's getting too annoying now. This app is too unresponsive and I use a s10 and it's also the same thing on my dad's s20."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",
            "This app has alot of cool updates but I can't do any of the songs. It says it can't play. But 1 day I used the app. And it finally work!!! But when I save the song I sang on rap mode. I can't even hear my voice singing the vibe. it kind of sucks. So I give it a review",

            "I understand that the refund is under process and will probably take 14 days to reflect into my account. I will wait for 14 days and check with the bank. However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important. I love wish!"

            "I think the developers are bored with this game. They seem to just be spewing out rehashes of levels and the only updates appear to be efforts to wind back rewards and get as much money as they can out out of players before they cut and run. From a good game to one of the most boring in a few updates. Got a few months free play then zip, uninstall. Don't bother, money grubbers. Not worth it.",
            "I loved this game starting out but now that I'm in the 3000 plus levels I hardly win. The earthworm challenges are almost impossible to beat. Theres some fun little challenges but unless you can beat at least 10 levels you dont get the rewards. Be ready to spend a lot of money to buy gold to be able to beat levels. I've been playing since 2017 but I haven't hardly played in the last couple weeks. Probably gonna be uninstalling it very soon. Feels like more work than fun anymore",
            "This game has become unplayable without buying gold. I'm on level 3650. You can spend hours doing one level which is boring. If they added one move each time you failed a level it wouldn't be too bad, but you have to fail numerous times before a move gets added. The league tables are a joke as well , instead of being called the \"Championship of Great Britain\" it should be called the \"Championship of Who Can Afford the Most Gold\". I used to love this game to the point of obsession, not now tho'.",
            "It's a really fun, cute puzzler and the challenge is good. However I disagree with some of the micro transaction tactics. Constantly being left at the end of a level being 1 move short due to the RNG of the blocks dropping from the top where you need them to line up is very frustrating and you are tempted to buy extra moves with real money which I disagree with. The fiend styles are pretty cool though and are maybe worth buying to support the game. Not extra moves!",
            "OMG, you keep changing how the game scores making it harder to earn points. Stop changing how points are earned. After 3 years of playing, I'm about to quit. I play games for fun and pleasure, not to be fustrated by playing a level repeatedly that can't be skipped. I'm going on a long break from this game. Hopefully you make it fun again when I come back. Also, File size is getting too big."

            "It used to be the easiest voting app to watch ads from but the latest update is so frustrating. Why did they put 24-hour reset time? It's not everyday that we get free time during a certain hour. Say I've watched the first ad at 4pm today since I have a free time. Why do I have to wait until 4pm tomorrow to start watching ads again? I mean, it really lost its convenience. Please bring the reset time to 00:00 KST. It works well for everyone that way. Until then, I can only give one star.",
            "I think this apps become worse after the latest update. I can't watch the ads even after 24 hours and the ads keeps unavailable. The worse is the notification said that I already reached my limit of watching ads when I did not even watch any. Please give back the old version since I did not have any problems with it before.",

Please do something about video viewing here in the Philippines. I want to make the most of this app. Please do something about it... [EDIT: OCTOBER] Thank you very much for continuing the video viewing here in the Philippines! +üåü! And also the new update is truly the best! Thank you for always providing the best service possible",
            "This is a great application before something went wrong, I can't watch my ads anymore, it's always says \"There aren't ads available at this moment. Please try again later\" even tho I didn't watch any ads today and the ads sign is still 0/15, please fix this problem, as soon as possible.",
            "Normally I use the app while connected to WiFi but today I used data and when I opened the app all my account details were gone even my beats, I had to create another mubeat account which I did not like at all. The app worked great at first but now I don't know what is wrong with it.

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "The cloud itself is pretty fine, but the app is weak in terms of a cloud app. It can't check file checksum to see if the file already exists so that it doesn't re-upload it. Multi selection of the items are not possible, you should select them manually by hand, which is funny! Recently I've seen some instances of users complaining that pCloud or other 3rd parties scan your files to check if there are any so called \"illegal\" files and they terminate your account. This is the opposite of privacy!",
            "No way to upload files and open new folders. Yet it reads: \"created folder\": \"uploaded files\". Network ok. Other fully functional apps. Update today 22/10/2020. Version2.11.2. But already with the previous version ie version 2.9.1 I had the same problems. But momentary, not like today. Thanks for the attention. Good job . In Trust I always leave 3 stars. GOOD DAY .Review update 22/10/2020 All solved for now. Thanks for the effort, the commitment and the seriousness. Let's go to 4‚≠ê",

Then this is for you, the media streaming facility is excellent. I've compared it's lifetime plan against Google drive, idrive, purchasing a nas. It's without a doubt the most sensible choice.",
            "Still now it's good to use. But one think I want to know,after installing day to now present time, how much MB (products) I upload on this \"pCloud\" free cloud storage,I found 1 thing is not going well, For ex:- supposed that, I upload 20 MB on this 'pCloud\" store,but the problem is I see,everytime I upload any file any size,after completing upload,if I go settings-app & notification-click on this \"pCloud\" I see as much (MB/GB) upload on \"pCloud\" storage,this app size will also expend the same.",
            "This company isn't able to repair a bug in the audio player reported 8 months ago. After I sent a reminder I got a reply saying: \"Be advised that your feedback has been provided to the Android team months ago. You don't need to worry, we are already working on a new and improved Audio player.\" - That was in July, no change since then. They claim to be \"a young forward-thinking team doing our best to make a significant impact on the rapidly growing IT market\". Not like this, guys."

            "I just downloaded this app, and I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews on many issues. First of all, I have MS, and I was looking for an app that will work my abs while sitting down. This app does not do this at all. It mainly works the arms. Then it does not have a voice magnetism at all only the music. You have to watch the screen to know what is next and how to do it. At hee end, the app stopped working. I am definitely uninstalling. Looking for another app for the abs.",
            "I love this app! I lost my entire left leg and have gone from an independent, active person to someone who has to rely on another for 80% of daily activities. This app has given me hope and encouragement that, even though life has totally changed, I can be active and feel positive about myself and what life will turn out to be!! THANKU SO VERY MUCH",
            "My daughter is very weak and problems standing. This app is wonderful, I just wish the exercises model moved a little slower. Thanks",
            "This was great for me. I haven't been able to get any excercises in for a long time due to health issues. I actually broke out in a serious sweat. Thanx for having this app",
            "Love this! I am recovering from double knee surgery and needed to find a way of exercising without causing pain or damage to my knees. My hear rate was raised and it's really fun to do ! Obviously the more effort you put in, the more you're going to get out of it"

But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",
            "Poor experience in fast forward condition first you need to buy package than you can allow to use fast forward and that also not that great which you paid for cloud package Please put fast forward specifications in SD card also because without this specification no use to find person as soon as possible..... Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

            "It used to be a good game until the last update. Instead of the usual 25 diamonds reward players usually got, now it's only 5 diamonds. The most ridiculous thing is that now you have to watch ads in order to apply lipsticks for every single client. What is this? I've watched ads and paid gems for many of the lipstick colours before but now?? Basically have to repeat all of that but now it seems endless. This game becomes kind of unbearable to play now. Please bring back the older features.",
            "Fantastic and creative game but why so many adds?! Adds are too much, every 30 sec. and they cause the game to lag. Please consider our time too. Recently, I finally paid up for no adds and now my game is locking up constantly. Newest updates cost too much money and you don't win diamonds like we used to in tasks. Not happy with the direction this game has gone. Used to be my favorite fashion game. So, so sad. 2020.",
            "Very wonderful and my favourite game of all.....üíêüíêüß° I am playing super stylish from many months . Last year I downloaded this game I reached till level 21 or 18 but the game was hanged it wasn't loading . So I had to delete my favourite game. Then again I wanted to download it this year then I was feeling angry I had to start now from level 1 again!! Then now I have reached level 10 . Please ensure that this game should hang once again !! Please! See to it .. but it is my favourite game!",
            "I love this game so much fun especially since I love fashion games and dancing games the adds are a little crazy but not that bad. It is a lil annoying having that in app purchase add pops up everytime u level up but that's ok I still absolutely love this game no doubt about it. Another thing can u do is make it so ur character has a name please. But no other complaints. :D",
            "Omg where to begin. I've reached level 80 and no longer get any clients and it's hard for me to get any collection. When i tried to install and play other apps recommended from the app itself and decided to uninstall the new game, super stylist got uninstalled as well and i had to start all over again and lost collections i used to have."

Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. üëç",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this oneüò™",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos.

How about donate some of the money to your tech so it is user friendly! Uninstall. I'll be looking for a paid version of this that donates a dollar a month.",
            "This might be the worst app I've ever used. The purpose would be great if it worked consistently. Freezes constantly. GPS tracking is way off. Sometimes it gives more mileage, and others it registers nothing at all. Also claims to have Strava integration but that doesn't seem to work at all after trying 100 times to troubleshoot it with their service team. Massive improvements needed for Android application.",
            "OCT 2020 UPDATE: Still buggy & problematic; uninstalling. \"Woof Trax\" app is a better fit for me. JAN 2020 UPDATE: I've had this app for years & definitely love & appreciate the link between fitness & chartible giving. But the last update in Dec has been problematic. For example: after multiple walks per day (I have a very active dog), app fails to consistently log/update daily miles, my \"streak\" always remains at \"0 Days,\" and continually fails to link w/the \"Walgreens/Bal. Rewards\" app.",
            "It's ok. Unable to view all ur donors though. Very frustrating! And when u try to link it to another app for rewards, ex: Walgreen's balance rewards, it says connected and linked, but then u go on Walgreen's, and it's not! Also very frustrating... and disappointing!!",
            "I really want this to be a great app but I continue to have issues with tracking. It's accuracy is off if it even continues to track after minimizing the app to answer a text or something. I've reached out before to the developer and haven't gotten feedback to questions."

            "The app is quite good, but sometimes doesn't recognise notes and picks up wrong notes. I didn't realise I had to pay to play songs after my free trial. It's stupid, I wouldn't want to pay, I don't want to learn the piano seriously, just to know a few simple songs like jingle bells. It's a useful app, but maybe make it free, or cheaper.",
            "Simply Piano is fun, for me I think it helps with apply your learning with reading notes, and applying the skills you have learned, to help you play the Piano/Keyboard. I wish you didn't have to pay to learn how to play the Piano/Keyboard with your right hand. If they allowed the whole entire app to be free with no payments I would have rated it a 5 star. Overall, the free version is okay.",
            "It's honestly great for beginners, but the detection of the note you're playing is terrible if i'm playing chords. i bought the 12 months package and the only sheet music i have now is Ode To Joy. It'd be lovely if you could add more sheet music and you can search for them because we already paid for it along with the 12 months access. also, could you use the singer's voice instead for the songs and the right pitch? Thank You xx",
            "I had a problem with my Tab position once I started left hand practise. I think I've sorted it now. I did have Tab directly in front of me. Once I moved it to the left at angle. The App is recognising when I hit the notes now. I'm really enjoying these lessons. I only wish I started last year. I had my Keyboard for Christmas present in 2018.",
            "Sometimes Someone would talk and the app would recognize the note. Other times I had to play the note at least 3 times until it finally recognized it. Also didnt like the cover song practices, dont add the singer if you're just going to lower the volume of the entire song when I start playing- you shouldn't have to do that, I could hear my piano fine, but it's like the app couldn't. Also big problem with premium, you can't do much without it, so why doesn't it tell me I have to pay beforehand???"

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",

I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. üò°",

Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 secondsü•∂üò¨üò¨ Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "I often use the free version of TeamViewer to help my brother with his PC issues, so thought I'd try it for mobile phones. We have the same phone, so I installed this on my phone, to test it out. The PC connected (telling me that I was limited to 5 mins), and worked very well, but then suddenly disconnected after a minute or so. When I try to reconnect, I keep getting an error \"Connection blocked after timeout\", and tells me there's a session limit, and to retry again in a minute. So I wait a minute.... and am told to wait another minute, then another minute. Some time later I tried again: I got a minute or two of access, then kicked out again My first impressions are that, unless I pay for the full version (we're talking ¬£15 PER MONTH here!), this one isn't going to be any use to me, so I'm only going to give it one star - sorry!",
            "To the developer, you need to be more clear on the purpose of this app. People are often more stupid then average and down load apps because what they assume the purpose of the app. It works perfect for the intended use; i.e. helping move around apps and trouble shoot remotely. Not controlling games are all kinds of no sense Ive read in the comments. Smh"

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

Got this app & within 10m it did not meet expectations. First reaction when scrolling through categories was that there was KPOP. Initial Instinct was there were INTL songs. When I searched for more INTL songs there wasn't one. This is not \"Unlimited\" as the title says. A Premium Account is needed to unlock some songs & there are none Chinese songs that I found.",

The only thing is for a person who's not on here a lot and singing for fun $19.99 is a lot to be asking for to have access to popular songs..üò©ü§î. But truly I'm excited about this app! Needs a $5.99 or even $9.99 what I pay for iMusic but have unlimited access to. Something to think about.",

            "Overall, a good app, as it hardly affects anything, but the notifications are kind of annoying(to be more specific, the pne that says \"Please sign in your samsung account to continue using services securely\" or something like that. If you do see this review Samsung, please do allow the ability to mute notifications. But if that is not possible, i will just stick to the best settings i can. If a user has the same problems i have, i recommend turning importance to low in the settings for the app.",
            "TERRIBLE! this app is frequently (almost every minute) sending me a notification that the app is not working. I cannot delete the app, I cannot access its setting or permissions or notifications. It makes my phone crash at least twice a day. None of the phone shops can fix it, Samsung does not reply to my emails about it and I'm ready to go back to iPhone!",
            "Hijacks phone taking total control, forcing you to use samsung apps not allowing you to choose! Takes up most of storage on phone (over half used on phone and I only had it less than a month!) Tried to clear cache and data used by Samsung, force stop then next day are notifications of tracing, tracking and recording my phone and personal info!!! Why? And who gave permission??? NOT ME! My friend Samsung,! or \"dreamqltesq\" overrides permissions and retakes control AGAIN! HUGE TRUST ISSUS SAMSUNG",
            "I'd like to rate this as a 0.-100., i strongly suggest that you never use it. Mainly because it's associated to Chrome by google., and if you don't know what capability Chrome has i suggest you do your research. I used Samsung and it screwed my entire phone up. I thought it was me, screwing it up at first but later found out it was Samsung and chrome.",
            "Samsung account wants me to sign in all the time. There's a problem with that, I have updated my new phone number every where and removed the old one but Samsung acct wants me to verify by sending a code to my previous phone number. I don't have access to that number. Therefore, since Sam acct wants me to do this routine with everything I do online, it's limiting my use. So, I have no clue what I'm supposed to do. I have looked into it and have read there are many people having this problem."

            "As a former I.T. consultant, this app is very easy to use, very simple, has solid functionality. I've had it for about a year. And I highly recommend it to everyone fo dictation, record music , your class lecture ; and there's no time limit either . The upgrade function as even more capability. The app has very minor and very occasional ads that are not disruptive at all in my opinion . And it's basically flawless.",
            "I've been using a portable microphone to attempt field recording for video game sound design and the app does what I need for the level I'm at. With multiple encodings for the audio, and control over sampling rate, you have a pretty decent tool. Also comes with noise suppression and echo cancellation which is more than you'd expect a free app to offer. I was going to complain about the lack of cloud synchronization...but apparently that's in the paid version üòº. I'd say it's worth it.",
            "This is an amazingly clear, and on point \"Free For All Platform App\", that works great on my 2019 reliable Honor 10 Lite!!! Please note for a great user experience: A word of advice though is to have an android agreement with Google Drive/Microsoft Cloud, as a safer way for data transition to other devices and/or flash drives. Also worth having antivirus/anti-adware/spyware software installed accordingly... Enjoy - Namaste üôè‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüïäÔ∏èüòá",
            "Awesome app, very useful. The only 2 improvements I can see is adding a feature to allow a shortcut to access the recording, such as double tapping on the power button or the volume button. The second one would be having the ability to do audio compression to reduce the size of the file.",
            "Excellent!! This app has recorded many sermons at church for my disabled husband to hear, phone calls on speaker phone, songs I've sung, college projects and speeches, and much more, all with amazing clarity and ease of use! I HIGHLY recommend. I've had and have used this app for well over a year."

GRUMPY always makes me smile. Seriously give him a try you'll be glad you did!!",
            "I loved this game, play it everyday sometimes 2 or 3 times but after the update its always crashing on me. I had over 100 chips this morning and every game I tried to play it let me buy the game, start playing then freeze until it comes up game over. Im not playing again till this is fixed - a shame as it would have been a 5 star review last week ‚òπ",
            "Wonderful game. Tired of having credits taken away every single day lately without the benefit of actually getting to play. Frustrated! Looking for new favorite game if support can't fix this issue. ü§¨ I reach out to support and all I get is information on how the game works. No refund whatsoever on my credits. What a joke.",
            "Great game for bingo lovers, I play every morning with my cup of coffee and some Bingo Bash, love the game but getting annoyed with the gifts every night it comes thru get your gift and you hit the icon and no free surprise its been going on for weeks now, i play every day and do spend a good bit of money on chips, please tske a look or fix or I'll have to lower from 5 stars, i do love the game but very annoying",
            "I find it boring now. I love playing mini games as Rapid bingo or Grand tour. I always loose all my chips in rapid bingo. Very few times I won otherwise always loose chips.From last 6 months playing Grand tour but not won 300 chips reward. So stop playing that also. I find your team is only interested who put money. Those who play with free chips, your team don't bother. Now I feel depressed while playing this game, while loosing the chips. Earlier this game was my favorite."

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",

EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",

I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",

Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a üåü from me."

        "description": "Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.\r\nThe virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus.

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "With the recent update of the past month I just finally updated, the app is slightly annoying. Mainly do to I can't change music from notifications. I had to open the app to swap left/right and more than half of the time, I can't click the music next to a playing song. Again, I had to go inside the app and swap to it. Until this is fix, I'm giving it 3 stars. It's a good app, but the notifications bug is quite a pain to to.",
            "Ok so it is ok but the ads are getting worse, I would understand two ads (where one lasts 5 sec) but each lasting 30 seconds? Rlly? Before I could listen to the music offline and there were less ads but now it's just a total mess. To close those annoying ads I have to back out of the app completely. Edit: I already know that they get paid for ads, it's just that there's more than before. Also the ads are very long, especially for an app like this, where you listen to music...",
            "With the current laptop I'm using I've had to continuously check back onto youtube to unpause the music when i click onto something, just typing and sending would pause the video... This app is wonderful, i never had a disruption other than adds and their only 1-2 so its not that bothersome! Thank you! I can now listen to my music in peace <3",
            "Normally a great app for listening to music but in these last couple months, the app has been unusable. Major bugs keeping me from searching for an artist or entering a playlist. The app frezes and just acts like it doesn't know what it's suppose to do. I used to love soundcloud but I can't keep using it if continues to have these bugs even months after they started showing up.",
            "Sound cloud is great because not only can you enjoy a vast range of music variety, but you can also upload your own music on there as an artist. And also offers features such as repost which allows you to get your music heard by hundreds of thousands of listeners. This is probably one of the best platforms to build a fan base and sell your music. I would recommend this platform to any artist or anyone who loves music."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

I give it 10 * all the way around!",

The guide online is not an accurate reflection of the app. When searching for a printer, it searches without giving me any additional options, and always says the printer is not found. It might be a good app, but i can't use it!",

            "I've played more than half of the Game House Stories and this one blew me away with it's elegant level design. The design is on par with the best of the series which for me was Wonder Wedding and Maggie's Movies 1. I also loved the unique mechanics of strategizing my menu and the extra challenge of managing baby Paige. Not a whole lot of story in this one but I still got warm feels from the cute moments, beautiful scenery and soothing music. Definitely worth playing-- one of the best!!",
            "Very badüò´üò´üòî! I thought I can play the whole game but this time only 5 levels I could play only because after fifth level we should pay money . Everything is good and best how they presented the game, but i disliked one thing which is we should pay after fifth level. Did only came here to play till fifth levelüòüüòüüòüüòü",
            "Last level in daycare is dumb and very annoying! Is an okay game I guess. The free game \"Primrose Place\" is one of the best however. I wish you'd make a game out of the Cafe from Primrose Place. Out of all the Delicious games I've played so far on Android I've enjoyed 2.",
            "Total Waste of $$$ I was hooked on this game after playing it at Applebee's so I downloaded the free version on my phone, BUT it turned out the \"free\"play only lasts til level 6. (Plus it was draining my phone battery daily, so I got rid of it). Eventually I tried the $9.99 option and bought the game, as I thought it would allow you to advance to unlimited levels, like most other games do. NOPE. The game ends after 10 levels. I normally don't pay for games or extras so I feel REALLY ripped off!!",
            "Overall I love this whole series. My biggest complaint is that I resent watching the credits over and over. Even assuming you play perfectly, you have to watch them twice. If you have trouble with one of the two levels that precede the credits, and need to replay the level to earn all the trophies, you need to watch the credits with every repetition. I respect the developers and am happy to watch the credits...once. I wish the app knew that you had watched them already, and quit repeating."

            "The overall system/hub is great. However, this app is slow and clunky. Classic was better. It takes some time to load everything on launch before I can do anything. Then, when you go into a device, there's only a tiny space on the sides to scroll. Otherwise, if you scroll in the middle fast, it won't scroll, gotta go slow and it looks like it wants to select an option. You simply cannot scroll past a color wheel for a light because you'll just be selecting a color instead of scrolling. Annoying.",
            "Could use a little work. Looks are better than the features. I wish for the oven connection, I didn't have to start while right in front of it and rather be able to at least start keep warm to get the oven started. Also that you have to stop oven to change which to a different setting then have to be once more right in front of oven to begin the new setting. I do understand it for security, but I think there should be a way to also disable temp for more secure homes.",
            "If anyone else in your home uses the app to do something on the tv it basically makes your app unusable for the rest of the day. My wife used it and I try to use it a few minutes later to change the settings on my tv and I'm stuck in an infinite sign in loop. It's stupid. Why even add a feature to add other accounts to the group if only one can even navigate the app at a time?",
            "Edit: Still not compatible with Android 11. I've been paying monthly for my smart Tracker service that I'm not able to use. This is unacceptable from such a large company. Not compatible with Android 11 can use my tracker anymore. Reached out to support and they told me an official version of Android is not supported... Reached out to support again and they said android 11 isn't supported because it's in beta. It hasn't been in beta for almost a month now and I can't use my smart Tracker.",
            "The app says we have to download an add on. I press download and it says we can't download it, contact us. I contacted several times and didn't get any feedback. Well done guys. Even when it works, the touchpad works only once !!! After that you have to restart the app to use the touchpad But, someone's you can't even stop the app."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to üëç. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

However this is the only spoon energy management app available and does what it says on the tin. Users create activities or choose from presets, and assign spoon values to them. As users complete their to-do lists, the app subtracts the spoon values of each activity from the days' spoons as set by the user. The app also includes a mood tracker. The developer Rob is friendly and responsive.",

Can you please advise me on this? It's SO tedious entering the details twice! Thank you in anticipation üòä",

Would like some instructions on data access in this .db file",

Now that Ihave had some time to familiarize myself with your app I can see that it is actually pretty functional. You need to compose a concise tutorial that explains how the app works for new users.",
            "I would give this a 5 star, however, the only additional feature that would make this nice (if already a feature I cannot figure it out) is to be able to have sub labels. Example: top label \"Medical\" then within that label have several other labels \"Mine\", \"Hers\", \"Kids\", etc... Kinda like a folder structure in Microsoft Windows. Right now, if I have a label named \"Medical\" then I have to put all in that one label which makes it unorganized.",

Remember face id not Touch ID because I'm using a Chromebook not an android phone so pleeeeeeeeeeeeas face id and also please not in pro version because I am a kid and I don't have any money.

            "I don't know what the people complaining about this app have on their phones, but I have had no problems at all. I love this app. It keeps my phone running smooth. I free up memory and change permissions to keep apps from screen using my battery. The only problem I had, was trying to find it. So I could put it on my home screen. I would also add, I don't want Samsung Members app telling me fix something. This app should do that. The Samsung Members app asks for too many intrusive permissions.",
            "A must have and a very helpful App for daily phone management task. I really appreciate the enhanced deeper settings. The only reason why don't I give 5 stars rating is the configuration I set in the Deep Sleep Apps in Battery Manager section is auto-reverted to the default state after applying the last update, in which All Apps that I had blocked (disable) to run in the background had gone from the list -- the Apps list was cleared, so I had to reconfigure it all one by one manually.",
            "The app is constantly crashing . Error msg Said - \" Device care isn't working\" then a few other System files \" aren't working' . I'm not Sure if its a Note10+ problem or Samsung acrossthe board but the errors & Crashes are too frequent on numerous critical apps. Ive never had a phone that Completely freezes or had so many errors/Crashes before , System optimizing always reads 100% but each option needs to be dealt w! seperathy to optimize each segment.",
            "Nice app but on the note 20 ultra there is no virus Scan like I've Seen Maybe on the s20 ?what's up with that ? Maybe Had it Been there I wouldn't have got hacked \"Bruteforce\" attacks.Malware Straight from Google pre-installed apps and security features off from the start. Should be the other way around. You have to go Deep ! My OS is Like Imei etc !3rd Party please Add a deep Scanning Tool Like for the S 20 !!. my Sim Card even after Changing numbers.TY",
            "What can I use on a S20+ to replace this worthless app? This one is really screwed up. It does not clear up the memory now like it used to. Going to put the original app back on here. Never understand why they always have to mess with something that didn't need improvement This thing is so screwed up it's not even worth the room it is taken up on my phone."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",
            "I'm not very happy that Norton does not provide coverage for Microsoft Explorer. Also if you add a website to the unblocked list they are not unblocked immediately. They have a few kinks to work out for me."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",
            "Just purchased an ebook. Money has been deducted from my account and the transaction is shown to be successful. Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "This game is awesome in my opinion you can care for it and play games most of them take finger and hand eye coordination so if you need to practice some of the games will help you can go outside and collect food from the trees just like animal crossing",
            "I give this game 5 stars because it is super fun, easy and has so many ideas for clothing and boo games that you can unlock and enjoy plus you don't have to pay. So I will recommend this game. üòÄ",
            "I love this app so cute and fun but the only thing I'm having problems with is that when I try to enter my age, it does not let me continue after I have put in my age. Please help. üíô",
            "It's a great game but the amount of ads you put into the minigames now is driving me absolutely insane."

            "Mobile check deposit feature seems to have a bug, where it doesn't read the camera's orientation correctly after the first picture taken. It looks like the image is getting rotated again, so it's really squashed and not at the correct aspect ratio. You have to take the other picture manually, as the automatic feature doesn't really work when it gets into this state.",
            "I was loving this app for depositing check, since my company doesn't have direct deposit. But lately, after I take the photo of one side of the check, I can't get a photo of the other side, because the app wants to take the photo in a long skinny \"letterbox\" format. It's quicker to get in the car and drive to an ATM than it is to get this to work. It makes the app useless to me.",
            "This app just sucks. Rarely do I get the notifications that I set up in the app for alerts and if I do get them it's not until several hours later. Sometimes the app will open itself back up after I've already checked it and closed it out. Very frustrating to use. I've had several other banking apps and none have given me the problems BoA does. May be time for a new bank but until then my review of this app stays the same.",
            "This App is wonderful and allows me to have a full banking experience. It even includes a chat feature which guides you through different topics of questions or concerns you have. It's very convenient that you can request a call from Customer service in the App so that you have zero wait time on hold and you generally receive a call within 5 minutes Max.",
            "Terrible check capture. Clearly now a bug where you can only capture one side of a check. All subsequent attempts shows a skewed camera view and nonsensical pop-ups that renders it impossible. Only solution is to close and reopen the app, but you still can't capture both sides. Great timing when people don't want to visit branches in person. No QC at all during the pandemic?"

Then I tried the original bank account to send money. It keep saying cannot process try later. It's been three days and still now working. What a shame. I loved this app before, now I dont. Have to find another way to send money.",
            "There isno feedback on payments and I had to exit and re-open the app to see my payment was sent. The settings suck, if something is on and you want it off, the app starts linking your accounts instead of being an off or on option. Whatever you do, don't accidentally break their rules or they will ban you for life and not give you an appeal option. The parent company will persecute you of you treat anyone the way they treat their customers.",
            "I have had venmo since they started. I have not had any issues, I use it to accept payments. It makes budgeting easier for me as I use my venmo to make misc purchases that I don't want to use for my main account. No issues for me ever. I found venmo because originally I was with cash app. Someone hacked my acct and cash app penalized me and closed my account with no option to open again. Venmo saved the day! i love this app, my favorite part is the emojis!",
            "App keeps freezing and crashing out of nowhere. It still runs fine, but at least 2 or 3 times now I've sent money to someone and the app freezes while the money is sending. Only way to escape is by exiting the app through task manager. The money always goes through to the other person but this shouldn't happen. Also often the app will just freeze while I'm scrolling through transactions. Sometimes it resolves itself, sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise, I would rate this app 5 stars.",

It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it could be scrolling, tapping on something, etc., I have to restart the app each time.
