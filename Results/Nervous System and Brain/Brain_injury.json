The really exciting part is it gives an update to the TIPS section on how to live with an ABI every week",

My husband is already feeling like a baby with everything else that goes with his stroke from surgery for a glioblastoma. He has a very long term recovery ahead, and this app looks like it would help, but I also have to consider his feelings.",
            "For a recovery app that is intended for adults that have had a stroke or other brain injury it is very juvenile. same set up as the kids games. Make it friendly for all age groups. The encouraging voice is to childish and the whoka word it says is very annoying. Please make this so it is geared for adults. Thank you.",
            "The exercises are great and I quite like the progress and pace of them. I use this app with my cousin with Autism, and while it requires us to tutor him at times, he quite likes the app and finds I easy it use. Most aphasia apps ive found require quite a bit of money in order to unlock other content (content thats not that great too) so i appreciate how much you offer without the premium charge.",

Which makes it impossible to manually select a brain region and see what it is. You can only select from a list and I guess that is fine but 3D makes me think of an interactive 3D model which this is not",

            "Good. Ads are so minimal on the free version which is refreshing. Sometimes I find the instructions don't make sense, so you have to pause and think. But I suppose that's good because we are training our brains to get better. I'm using this because I had a brain tumour removed and I'm trying to get my cognitive abilities back. Using this gives me a great sense of accomplishment, and benchmarks for areas of improvement",
            "Great! Some problems/concerns: - time to read a task description should not be counted - better to not just choose a random exercises, but consider what a user was working on recently, cuz sometimes the app gives me the same one multiple times in a row - more statistics, please, so that I can track day to day progress - more exercises? Premium should help, but still",
            "So as others have already stated...why does the timer countdown when you are reading how to do the different brain exercises. That is not fair at all. If I'm new and learning how to play them for the first time the timer shld not start....and you should have a 30-60second to learn how to play it before jumping right into the exercise. Other than that I love the exercises and I'll keep training my 🧠.",
            "Great little brain games that I'm hoping will really make a difference in my brain strength over time! Lol. Only 4 stars instead of 5 though because I could be doing better on the game's if we had more clear instructions for Each game provided to us. Like Examples of exactly how.to do each game would be Great! 👌🏽😁",
            "Just what I needed! Beautifully designed app! I'm trying to improve my executive functioning because of what I think is the \"COVID Long Haul\" brain fog & forgetfullness. I also have ADHD & PTSD. This app is engaging like a game but not so addictive that it takes over my brain when I have something else I NEED to do. If it proves to have longer term benefits I will try to update this review. 😊"

            "The games are very challenging (to me anyway). If I am upset I get such a positive distraction from playing the Lumosity games. My memory has been greatly improved and it seems to have caused me to feel more positive and upbeat. The people who created these games well I could only wish to have such genius. Thank you very much. Cachal Teagues",
            "I've had this app for 10 years and this is a fun app when it comes to brain games. it does make you think and really makes you try to beat your timing when doing different games on here the only thing, I don't like is that you have to pay to do a different game if you want to do that differently daily or you have to wait daily for the games to change that's the only thing that sucks on here but all the games are fun. I love coffee game on here and I love the train game, super fun for the brain.",
            "I am very much enjoying myself....some are easy and some are more difficult.l think there could be a bit more extensive instruction with some of the puzzles.",
            "Pretty good, but the probably quiz is providing WRONG answer. It also doesn't accept equivalent answers. Looks like they don't care to fix the game that gives really WRONG results.",
            "Very well planned and paced puzzles, games, mind enhancing and training app. Very useful for people above 45 and those who are at risk of alzheimer disease."

            "Well, there are hundreds of advertisements which are displayed after 2 seconds! They are quite annoying. So, I didn't give 1 star. And also, in the levels, there is a option \" Enter \" which isn't working. Everytime I tap, it displays ❎. I request the producers to improve these problems. But it must be mentioned that this is an excellent game. There are tricky puzzles to play and pinch your brain and there are thousands of brain teasers. I do recommend this app to all customers. Thank you.",
            "Very fun, and entertaining!! :) You will be asked questions, they will seem almost impossible. But theres this Light Bulb you can click that gives you a hint. Sometimes you can answer. You don't always have to click the Light Bulb icon. The questions will get harder, and harder. Btw I love this app <3 Keep up the good work!!",
            "I love this game. It's interesting and good for time pass. So many people are saying in reviews that this app shows ads alot. For those people, I just want to say one thing 'Why don't you guys switch off your mobile data while playing this game?' Solution of your problem is too easy.",
            "This game is just like the rest and not that fun and you get to a question that looks like you should give you own answer, what rating would you give this game and the only one that is \"correct\" is the one that says full marks and then tries to make it seem like you wanted to pick that.... No. Just no."

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

Because in level 14 and 20 I got videos but I looked down and I never see anymore so I was thinking that it wasn't so bad that's why I gave it four stars and that's not all when I turn on my internet connection again it started to freeze up horbley",

            "I got up to the last board, then even though I was doing everything right the game wouldn't let me go on and win. It just froze and that's it. So frustrating. So now I'm boycotting every game from the maker"

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

Yes, obviously it's you, unless there's another entry on Google play called injury map which strangely charged my card that I signed up to your app with that I evidently have on my phone... Or I wouldn't be able to post a review, would I? Further it is $79.99 NZ I have been charged. I will happily post pictures.",
            "This is a life changing app that I'd recommend to everyone! Having been through many years of severe lower back issues and visited a range of specialists, only Injurymap has had a significant impact, with its daily activities, check ins after every step, and slow progress towards pain free movements.",
            "Using this app as I have a sore achilles. Found the exercises great and progressive. Has really made a difference. I will use this app. in the future as it definitely helps.",
            "Developer honestly states the cost ($3.49/mo or $23.99/yr) and describes the app in description.👍 I have not paid or used the app beyond free access, but being honest is very important, so I'm assuming developer is honest about parts of app that can't be freely used. Free access allows you to read the general program description and the 'Tips' section.",
            "The workouts seem to be well planned and truly helpful for rehabilitation. But the app has bugs and has lost my progress twice now... At this pace I will never be able to get past Phase 1. For a paid app I'm expecting no obvious bug like this that affects usability."

            "I love this app but one of the main paid features does not work. I want to download my entries to send to my therapist but the report output is incorrect. The emotions don't match with the correct day, the time of the entries show only the time you downloaded the report and it doesn't include any of the recorded cognitive dysfunctions I logged. I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",
            "Thus far, I say that this app was perfectly created! So far, what I've seen is very well organized & contains helpful lessons, informational videos, a personal journal, and more! This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

        "description": "Explore the brain from the palm of your hand! Learn about the structure and function of the human brain by interacting with high-resolution rotatable 3D models in real-time like you've never experienced it before! \r\nBrain Tutor uses rendered head and brain models as well as fiber tracts that were created from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a study volunteer. The MRI data allows to look \"inside\" the brain using real-time slicing at millimeter resolution. For students, cognitive neuroscientists, medical professionals and everyone interested in the brain, the program provides information about the anatomy and function of the human brain with various atlases describing and visualizing lobes, gyri, sulci, Brodmann areas, subcortical structures, selected specialized functional areas and major fiber tracts.\r\n\r\nWith Brain Tutor you can:\r\n* Explore high-resolution 3D models of the head and brain in real-time.\r\n* Visualize major white matter fiber tracts.\r\n* Slice the brain along three axes (sagittal, axial and coronal).\r\n* View MRI brain slices at millimeter resolution.\r\n* Learn from text information about the functions of selected lobes, gyri, sulci, subcortical structures, Brodmann areas, functional areas and fiber tracts.\r\n* Learn where brain structures are located both within 3D brain models as well as in MRI slices.\r\n\r\nTo get started:\r\n* Tap on a 3D brain model to reveal a brain area at that location.\r\n* Switch to another atlas and a specific brain area or fiber tract using the navigation tables.\r\n* Select a 3D model (left/right/both brain hemispheres, head) from the tab bar buttons at the bottom.\r\n* Pan with one finger to rotate a brain model.\r\n* Pan with two fingers to move a brain model.\r\n* Use pinch gesture to zoom a brain model.\r\n* Select the head model to switch to head slicing mode.\r\n* Toggle between navigation and slicing mode by tapping the slicing icon at the top right.\r\n* In head slicing mode, pan with one finger to move the slicing plane through the head.\r\n* Tap on a slicing direction icon in the top bar to switch between three orthogonal slice planes.\r\n* Tap on the displayed name of a selected brain structure to read text information in a popup dialog.\r\n\r\nThis app has been designed and programmed by Prof. Rainer Goebel, a leading expert in anatomical and functional brain imaging and award-winning developer of scientific software.

Where's LGN? superior colliculus? hell, where's v1?? as a phd student, thats the level of information that would be helpful for me - a lot of this is undergrad level knowledge (which is fine but there are alotta grads out there who could really benefit from more specific, less superficial info)",

            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

            "Awesome selection of games with no lives to have to wait for. You fail a level, you can redo it instantly with maybe a second ad. Some games are very simple and others are much more challenging. The controls are a little less calibrated than some of the original games, but doesn't make anything unplayable. Just have to get used to them. Only suggestion I can make is a way to see where the greatest areas of opportunity are by some type of test and then recommend the games in that area/s",
            "Its awesome and it has many games there is no need to install particular brain teasing games like sudoko... Very few ads come during game play and most good thing is that it allows you to quit the the ads... And there no need to give money here all the things here are almost free... Totally i am so satisfied 😃 with the game play lastly i thank to the developer for this mind blowing brain training puzzle game... Thanks....😁.",
            "First thing, I have to mention that I almost never rate an app 5 stars. I only just downloaded it early this morning, but I've been playing several of the games all day. It's an excellent app for stretching your mind! Don't take my word for it, try for yourself. 😉",
            "The game is great. It has lots of games and you don't have to waste your time downloading different games such as sadoku, solitaire and many more. The touch screen controls though could be better as it makes a couple of games extremely hard if not impossible because of the timing. Also some incentives for the coins would be good as I don't see what use they actually have so I wouldn't bother wasting any real money on them. I would give it a 5 star otherwise",
            "This application has a lot of potential, but the issue is that after everything you do there is an advertisement, i saw the same political advertisement over 7 times in a row an add i couldn't get out of unless I clicked on it or closed out of the application. I went ahead and uninstalled the app as I dont need to be bombarded with political propaganda after I successfully complete a puzzle."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "So I yesterday reviewed this and voted five stars. I even got a lot of friends and family to join because I was impressed with this app. Then today (like it had an update or something) it suddenly has multiple ads, and the app has decided to take away your ability to see your score in relation to others, which I could do just yesterday. If this continues unfortunately I'm going to have to uninstall this app. It seems like it's turned into a money grab",
            "It was great for the first few days, now to even finish my brain games I need to buy PRO version or share a lot on facebook? I barely used the non-pro version, how should I know if I wanna drop $80 on a \"lifetime subscription \"? I like the idea but dislike the limits placed on us. This last update was no bueno in my opinion. I used to be able to see \"you scored this compared to other users\" now it doesn't anymore and plugs the PRO version even harder! Will re-rate with PRO rating if I buy it",
            "Decent enough app, kind of fun. My problem is with the streak feature. it always keeps telling me I lose my streak just because I don't I don't log in exactly when it tells me to. This is b*******. I am a very busy individual. I will get to it when I get to it and not one second before. I can understand if I went an entire day between sessions period but two freaking hours? Unacceptable. Uninstalled this.",
            "pretty ok if you dont mind paying for it, there are trick games in there too so despite this being a direct copy of most of the other apps that claim to be brain training, this one gave me a sour taste from its format as there were two games copied from another app except given a change of color, the questions seemed to completely ignore my age and assumed i was almost 3 when asking \"what is a scarab\" when it asked me if it was a vulture or a beetle, quite hard to play since it feels off",
            "I normally don't give reviews but I love this game... or at least I think I do. There is not enough to go by in the free edition to adiquately rate the game. I would possibly give it 5-stars if there was a way to sample a larger selection of games without a subscription. Even if there was a way to earn samples of the locked games, I would be more encouraged to subscribe. My 3 star rating is based solely on the inability to sample what you want me to pay for. The more I play the more I like it."

            ". *update 2020* Wrote my first review for this game a few years ago. It was fun, now in 2020 I think it's more than fun- is essential. as we shelter in place, and home school-i think we need engaging apps like this one because it keeps us on our toes . Most importantly, it keeps learning fun! Love the new games. Overall WELLDONE!! bravo.",
            "Love it so much. It has a nice stempunk atmosphere, it's simple, it's challenging and smart and I can buy full access with no hidden deals. It's expensive for me (I am from Ukraine) but I bought Full premium after 20 mins of playing. Let's hope I won't be disappointed as I can actually quite impulsive. It's disappointing the relaxed mode is not included in the premium :(",
            "Great brain games except for a few minor annoyances, like some of the games require you to use old, outdated terminology or recognize items from the past, for example, the eggplants are white and round rather than being the purple ovals we have around today. I understand the steam punk theme but when it negatively impacts my score it is just really annoying... Other than that though, the app works really well and most games are unique, challenging, and fun!",
            "I really enjoy this game especially knowing playing helps build and strengthen my aging brain. I enjoy the daily games and the little bonuses you receive along the way. IGive it a try! Also side note, it wouldn't load after I stopped playing, had to reinstall and it still did it, however after u updated my phone it is working nicely. Definitely give it a spin and check it out for yourself.",
            "A good set of brain training exercises, with a strong Victorian flavor. It's wonderful if you're a steampunk. But even buying the \"No ads\" option doesn't stop ads before it summarizes your score."

        "description": "Stream or download this qigong meditation lesson with this 60-minute video app. A 2014 study at Harvard shows that you can completely rebuild the brain with only 8 weeks of regular meditation practice. Meditation is excellent for simple relaxation, but is also known to benefit and even heal many ailments, including anxiety, stress-related disease, and more.\r\n\r\n• Stream or Download\r\n• English Subtitles\r\n• Become calm, centered and balanced.\r\n• Improve your health and longevity.\r\n• Learn one-on-one from an acclaimed Master.\r\nSingle in-app purchase (IAP) gets access to full-length video.\r\nDr. Yang, Jwing-Ming teaches the fundamentals of meditation, with details about posture, the Qi (energy) circulatory system, and how to properly practice Qigong Meditation to increase your martial power. His easy-to-follow lesson includes instruction of Embryonic Breathing, Laogong Breathing, Yongquan Breathing, Four Gates Breathing, and Martial Arts Grand Circulation. Embryonic Breathing is considered the missing link in meditation practice, which forms the foundation necessary for higher attainment and enlightenment. \r\nThe flow of Qi (energy) can be disturbed either through external trauma, such as an injury, or internal trauma such as depression or stress, or even just a sedentary lifestyle. When the body is energetically out of balance, this is when symptoms like aches and pain start to occur and we start to experience a state of \"disease\". Wherever you feel pain or tightness, your energetic circulation is stagnant, or even blocked. Stagnation is the root of injury or illness. Qigong meditation can increase the quantity of your Qi (energy) and improve the quality of your circulation.\r\nQi-gong translates from Chinese to Energy-Work. Qigong meditation creates balance in the body, both physically and energetically, by improving the flow of energy that circulates through the body in the meridians.

Meditation is excellent for simple relaxation, but is also known to benefit and even heal many ailments, including anxiety, stress-related disease, and more.<br><br>• Stream or Download<br>• English Subtitles<br>• Become calm, centered and balanced.<br>• Improve your health and longevity.<br>• Learn one-on-one from an acclaimed Master.<br>Single in-app purchase (IAP) gets access to full-length video.<br>Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming teaches the fundamentals of meditation, with details about posture, the Qi (energy) circulatory system, and how to properly practice Qigong Meditation to increase your martial power. His easy-to-follow lesson includes instruction of Embryonic Breathing, Laogong Breathing, Yongquan Breathing, Four Gates Breathing, and Martial Arts Grand Circulation. Embryonic Breathing is considered the missing link in meditation practice, which forms the foundation necessary for higher attainment and enlightenment. <br>The flow of Qi (energy) can be disturbed either through external trauma, such as an injury, or internal trauma such as depression or stress, or even just a sedentary lifestyle. When the body is energetically out of balance, this is when symptoms like aches and pain start to occur and we start to experience a state of &quot;disease&quot;. Wherever you feel pain or tightness, your energetic circulation is stagnant, or even blocked. Stagnation is the root of injury or illness. Qigong meditation can increase the quantity of your Qi (energy) and improve the quality of your circulation.<br>Qi-gong translates from Chinese to Energy-Work. Qigong meditation creates balance in the body, both physically and energetically, by improving the flow of energy that circulates through the body in the meridians. We all have a &quot;life force&quot;, Qi (energy) within all our trillions of cells, allowing them to function. Qi also regulates physical, emotional, mental and spiritual stability.

            "The best 👍💯🥰🥰😍😍😍😘😘lot of support from me. Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent 😋 and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever. And BTW Name's SIZZLE 13 years old 😁 ❤❤❤❤❤",
            "If I said thanks then this is not enough and it will never be enough. By all means, this app is remarkable and so useful. Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

        "description": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \r\n\r\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\r\n\r\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\r\n\r\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\r\n\r\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com.

            "Decent app, but not terribly detailed 3D content, and a blast of video ads right off the bat. It'd be sweet to have a chance to try before buying via ad. I spent more time of my first five minutes on ads than I did the app, which made it not worth my time. It may be fine otherwise, but there are online offerings that are simply more timee-effective for me.",
            "It's very sensitive, so its hard to control the angle of which you look at it. There are just too many ads as well. Maybe it was just me, but the ad on the bottom, covered the name of the part. So, it was basically useless having the app when I couldn't read the names of the parts. I'm pretty sure that the app is at fault for this, not my phone, but some of the choices didn't work that the menu had to offer. If I were you, just stick to pencil and paper.",

Studies done with patients undergoing EMDR while in CAT scans have shown physiological changes in the brain that lead to adaptive changes in thinking and emotional self-regulation. <br><br>&quot;A study comparing the effectiveness of Prozac vs. EMDR showed that EMDR was more successful than Prozac in achieving substantial and sustained reductions in anxiety and depression.&quot; <br>- The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, January 2007",

The meditations are easy to follow and incorporate several healing modalities that I found to be very helpful. I have struggled with anxiety and high stress levels. This app has provided an outlet to destress and heal. I am so grateful! I would highly recommend this app to my family or friends.",

I especially enjoy listening to the Brain Vitality section, it feels like I have hit a reboot button. My newest favorite is the section with guided meditation with areas from Sedona, Arizona. It leaves me refreshed like I have been in nature.",

The guidance is often clear and concise, yet very immersive. Definitely worth a try for anyone new to meditation or looking to deepen their mindfulness practice.",

            "I loved these varied and exceptionally challenging math puzzles. The hints provided were helpful, but were not so obvious as to give away the answer without serious thought. You really have to think outside the box; nonlinear thought is required to figure out the underlying pattern. Once you identify the pattern, it is then straightforward to solve the puzzle.",
            "Enjoyable and a bit challenging at times. There were a couple of problems that weren't clear how you were supposed to know to use a certain number as a reference. The clearest form of this was on one of the questions, the hint was \" - 40\". I dont know how I was supposed to know to subtract each answer from 40. It just seemed like an arbitrary number that you had to use the hint to know. Other than those questions, which there were only a few, I really enjoyed using this app.",
            "Good for getting basic math practice in from what I am able to play. Unfortunately I am stuck on a level that requires multiple entries and will not allow multiple entries. I had the right answer, but could not enter it. Very frustrating. Maybe a quick tutorial on the various ways you may have to enter answers would fix this. I probably could figure it out if it isn't a bug, but there are millions of games out there. This just turned me off. Next!",
            "Made me recall the simple rules like pemdas, also adding some \"additional\" rules to solve levels as they progress; many answers based on correlation of number sets. Being dyslexic, this game is/was very empowering for me, as I started out sailing through without having to write anything down to solve any of the puzzles. However, after I got stuck on level 58 (by coincidence) my shrink lowered my adderall dose and now I can't make it past level 30 without working the problems on paper. :(",
            "Some of the puzzles are pretty difficult, but none are too difficult that they can't be completed with a little math knowledge and a bit of outside-the-box thinking. Overall, I enjoyed this app, and completing it is a good brain exercise. Some of the puzzles don't actually require math to solve, which annoyed me at first, but after doing a few I thought it was good to force my brain to think more outside the box than just simply looking for a mathematical pattern. Pretty darn good app."

Every type of situation and desire can be fulfilled by this app. You can relax, have deep sleep, memorize everything, study focused and deep meditation. Just wow what else can I say. Highlyyyyyyy recommended!! Must install.😇😇",
            "Would have given 5 stats, please make the background music OPTIONAL! Music can be very relaxing, but some would rather hear nothing just the frequency playing.",
            "I have used this ape for years and I love it. Its It's relaxing and never disappoints. It keeps me calm. Have tried others only to come back to this one. I like that I can set the time.",
            "I love this app but i have a few suggestions... first of all, it'd be nice if I'd choose background melody. For example, i need boost my brain in the morning but i don't like the Beta Wave melody... very much. plus, the quality of the pics isn't good which is a lil bit annoying too. but it'd be even better if there were a video or gif instead of photo. anyway, your beats don't hurt my poor ears just like other similar apps do. thank you",
            "It Actually Works.. no headaches or loud \"wahh\" sounds. The light music plays well with each beat. If you want a no nonsense, no (my head is going to explode\" and simply beats with music. Yes, You can create your own as well. Its nice and soothing as it should be! 😊"

And one issue I've faced is that - articles do not get saved / bookmarked when you do it while reading the article. Instead they get saved when only done from the homepage. Please address these in the upcoming software releases. Thanks.",

There is virtually an endless amount of captivating expositions, scientific research reports, absorbing true stories/essays and much more; this app is a cerebral goldmine that spans many scientific disciplines ranging from Neuroscience, neuropsychology, psychology, biochemistry and beyond. This application is an absolute must-have for anyone interested in Neuroscience or even those who just have an intellectual curiousity! Install it now"

Little and often is what's needed so even on a busy day you can do something to help.",

However this app is more than dealing with pain. It's about neuroplasticity which is now helping me eliminate vertigo and tinnitus. Definitely worth the subscription as they are constantly updating content.",

I am really shocked, in a good way. I am normally reluctant to pay for an app but compared to the thousands spent on gp, physio, chiro, pain medication, this is really not much. It has given me back some hope that my quality of life will improve which is priceless. I'll update the review after a few weeks, maybe even pain free!",
            "WOW the whole app changed since I been thinking of doing it. Is there no more old sessions? What happened to the old sessions? I know I tested the old 10 free sessions & loved them, but was not ready to use the app & now everything change. As well as why can't your app be moved to the sd card? It takes too much space on the internal space when you are low on space. The app keeps crashing because my phone is low on space as there is no way to move it to the SD card."

On your about page you have words like yarning instead of yawning, that needs to be change. There are a few more edits needed, but that jumped off the page.",
            "Fantastic tool. Worth it for medical professionals and their patients/clients right across the entire pain spectrum to start the \"self\" rediscovery journey to self management with little to no medical intervention. What a gift for all of us who suffer 24/7 with these horrible & debilitating \"invisible\" (& therefore usually dismissed, belittled & not often believed) chronic/complex nerve pain syndromes. Maybe this could even help save some lives. Going to share the hell out of this app to get the word put. Well done Development Team! .. Thankyou",

I have been using for a full month now snd plan to keep using the program!",

        "description": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \r\n\r\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \r\n\r\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \r\n\r\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \r\n\r\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\r\n\r\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \r\n\r\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \r\n\r\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\r\n\r\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \r\nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \r\nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section.",

A cause of yet more pain, rather than less. HOWEVER with 24 hours of contacting their site, Mark Grant the creator and proprietor himself had emailed me with unequivocal accecceptance of the problem AND total assaurance that it would be rectified absolutely ASAP. As indeed it was, with a further 24 hours. With commitment and integrity like that from the App's creator themselves, in tandem with the excellent quality of the App and it's otherwise easy to use functionality, the least I can give it is the maximum FIVE STAR rating.",

            "Definitely helps with chronic pain and anxiety. Well worth the money",
            "Buyer beware ... despite the title, only a few of the pain control tracks incorporate EMDR (Bls) technology and the tracks for \"intense pain\" all require the cooperation of another person acting as a pseudo-physical therapist ... if you read the app description on this page you will find tge developer coyly refers to this second human participant as an \"outside material.\" Shame on you Grant, chronic pain suffers are in the forefront of groups of people who shouldn't be exploited.",
            "Don't purchase. The app stops working randomly midway through sessions. It was glitchy the first time I used it, and the second and third times. That was it for me. Asked for a refund and radio silence."

After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "As a med student, i was having a bit difficulty visualizing all the structures, but this app has helped me so much! The app is great for me because i already have all the info i need. 3 stars because 1. I hope developer adds details for smaller structures and 2. An ad came up and covered all the buttons so it completely ruined the purpose of the app, so if you could place it on top of the screen instead of the bottom it'd be great. It works without an internet connection!!!! thank you 🙏💕",
            "It's a great 3D model for exploring gross structural anatomy of the brain, with lots of viewing options for internal parts and good descriptions per structure. However, the mechanics of the app need work, e.g. the touch recognition for zooming, panning, and rotating is not very smooth. And for some reason the ENTIRE brain stem (including the thalamus!) is recognized as one structure and called the \"pons\", which is not accurate??",
            "They mean well. There needs to be more information on the smaller parts of the brain. The global pallidus for eg has basically zero information of use. Also, the \"clicking\" on things on the phone isn't sensitive enough, it doesn't actually easily select stuff, have to battle with it.",
            "i wanted to know about the forebrain. This app did not give me a search area for brain parts. it gave me a home and rotate button. nothing happened when i tried to tap on different brain areas. after 5 minutes of getting no where I uninstalled. i also paid 2.99 to remove ads and there was still a. ad present at the bottom that i could not close. Terrible app",
            "It's really good if you want to disect and learn brain structure from top to bottom. Features like hide, fade, hide others were very very helpful. Thanks for this app."

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not 😊); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a £iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

Journey across various landscapes in search of mindfulness! You gain points for completing every meditation session and move forward on the path. Your current position can be seen on the map by a blue blinking sphere.\r\n\r\nYou can use our meditation assistant to set the duration for your meditation sessions and be notified in a non-obtrusive way when the duration is completed. You can view the stats on your previous sessions and view other useful information.\r\n\r\n\r\nBinaural beats -\r\n\r\nPlay your favorite binaural beats in an instant and get your brain in the state you want it to be. BrainWaves provides a collection of all the commonly produced brain waves and gets your brain operating in those frequencies and gaining the characteristics associated with that frequency.\r\n\r\nYou can use this app to help you concentrate better and feel more alert at your studies or work, or relax after a tiring or stressful period, or to help yourself to a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nJust open the app and choose whichever brain waves you want to play, and relax (or sleep, or feel alert, or feel drowsy depending on the brain waves you play!) and the app will instantly start playing the wave for as long as you want.\r\n\r\nYou can set the timer in the app to automatically stop playing a wave after a particular time.\r\n\r\nYou can also view your playing stats and see how often you have played each wave and the last time you played them.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\nTo get the best effects you should use stereo headphones while playing the binaural beats.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nDo not play these brain waves during driving or while operating heavy instruments.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS:\r\nHuman brain (along with brains of a vast number of other species) produces waves because of the rhythmic nature of firing of the neurons in the brain. When a large number of neurons vibrate in synchronisation a global wave pattern emerges in the brain. Different brain states such as sleeping, relaxing, working etc are associated with different waves.\r\n\r\nBy a process called brain entrainment, it is possible to make the brain to naturally synchronize to the frequency of external stimuli, and auditory stimuli are one major way to do so. By playing sounds of slightly different frequencies it is possible to make the brain produce a frequency equivalent to the difference in frequencies of the two sound, and by doing so one can cause the brain to produce the desired waves.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment#Music_and_the_frequency_following_response):\r\n\r\nChanges in neural oscillations, demonstrable through electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, are precipitated by listening to music, which can modulate autonomic arousal ergotropically and trophotropically, increasing and decreasing arousal respectively. Musical auditory stimulation has also been demonstrated to improve immune function, facilitate relaxation, improve mood, and contribute to the alleviation of stress. These findings have contributed to the development of neurologic music therapy, which uses music and song as an active and receptive intervention, to contribute to the treatment and management of disorders characterized by impairment to parts of the brain and central nervous system, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, cerebral palsy, Alzheimer's disease, and autism.\r\n\r\n\r\nSound credits - Additional sound effects from https://www.zapsplat.com",

            "Very nice app, actually the only one (i can find) who actually uses two different tones in each ear. Just as its supposed to be. instead of just playing a \"binaural beat\" where you hear the same tone in both ears. I would really love to have an option where u can finish your meditation with a soft bell sound instead of the bot saying \"congratz\" which catches me off guard. Highly recommend it. Am thinkjng about buying pro version! Keep it up guys!",
            "I loved this app a lot. It helped me focus on my studies and strengthen my concentration when I was distracted. I recommend this app to every person who wants to focus on work but cannot do so . It will help alot. Kudos to the makers.",
            "Cool idea, basic app, is a bit buggy (actually getting it to start meditating is challenging, it constantly won't shut up and ignores presses a lot) has a subscription to get anything more than binaural sounds",
            "Pretty easy to use . I play the beats along with my favorite piano and flute sounds . Really appreciate the app.",

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

        "version": "5.1.4",
        "recentChanges": "Meet the new generation of Replika avatars! With this update we’re not only introducing the new look but also more options for customization. Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

Or at least make the time for more than 200seconds or don't put a time limit at all",
            "Why is the there a time limit? The buttons on the keyboard never click or tyoe once you press them and the instruments used never actually finish the job so its just time wasted. It seem like a good game but incouldnt even pass level one bc of the instruments they never did the job even if i did what it told me too. I do not recommend this game to anyome with bad phones with a weird touch screen issue and to anyone who is impatient bc this game takes a lot of time just to write in the patient.",
            "Took me a while to figure out how too use the tools to help the patients. I finally found out though so, all good! Fun game if you like a chalange. ( They put you on a timer... to see if you will go fast enough to beat it ) So Again, it challenges you.",
            "the thing that I don't like about the game is that It doesn't give us enough time to write the info and sometimes when I try to typ a lettr it choosers a random one. I rate it 3 stars. needs some improvements",
            "Very poor game when i started surgery it had be hanging the game so i suggest who had made this game have check its problems"

Im not sure if its my device or the game but just trying to notify you. It always says please come again later or check your internet. Ive tryed restarting the game but its dosent work. Ive tryed most things but please update it so it works. Thank you! Oh and also your ad is abit innorpropriate for kids no worry if cant.",
            "I love the game.. but I got stuck in Level 57 and tried getting more bulb things by watching ads for about 15 times... downloaded quick yesterday too... I am trying a lot to load the ad from today 10 o clock but still as are not available... tried everything for this level...love this game but please bring the ads back or I will uninstall this game 😔 3 stars are good for a start 🤪",
            "I honestly thought that i would have a problem with ads with this game but not at all! Its super fun and entertaining! But i got this game off an ad and the ad was a bit... innopropiate. I think maybe to make the ads more kid - friendly. I understand that its funny that the people are naked but its not appropiate for this kind of game. Im not saying you have to change the ads but i just needed to say it.",
            "I don't know what other people are saying by the loading is taking forever,or too many ads. I just downloaded this and it is great not one ad in sight...... yet😂 I take it back I had 4 ads but that's ok only issue is the ad for the game underwear not on. not for younger kids!",
            "Me and my daughter liked the game and we paid for it. I dont like you guys don't let setting difficulty change and skip levels. It's so annoying. Its basically even if you paid for a game you still need to look advertisement for a clue. Other thing you made me sign up that you sharing my progress and othe information to advertisement. Without sign up the game won't start. So there is no button to decline. Also its says you can change it in a setting but you don't have as I said normal settings."

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Really, it is great, I've been following this app since years and the evolution has been amazing. Good for any health care professionals, students or just users. Thanks!",
            "This app need a lymphatic system, action animation so users can visually see muscle movement, a search bar so users can easily obtain information (for example search for levator scapula, then an image of levator scapula appears with all info, and finally if there was a way you can implement multiple model observation so if this app was to be use to inform a client or patient so practitioners and educators don't need to constantly start over. Overall all this app is great.",
            "Easy to use, limited in abilities, add-ons are stupid expensive considering the lack of abilities this app has. It could very easily be an excellent app if the developer's were less concerned with the revenue generating aspect of it and focused more on making it a great app first.",
            "I had left a 1 star review but then i realised i was wrong. The only thing that is missing from this app is the option to \"isolate\" a targeted muscle so you can see clearly it's origin and insertion. Other than that, very well made.",
            "Some weird formatting on the tables for the origin / insertion of different muscles. Also annoying that I get asked to rate the app every time I open a different menu. Otherwise, very helpful as a supplementary tool to learn anatomy. Really helps me conceptualize / visualize anatomy I'm less familiar with."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

        "comments": [
            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Ugh! Why do you guys always insist on \"improving\" EVERYTHING? What's wrong with just leaving a great game alone? I used to LOVE this puzzle game and had given it 5 stars but then you went and tried to \"improve\" on an already perfect app. Now there's constant lagging, you took away the ability to set pieces on the game board under the puzzle, you took away the \"move in\" \"move out\" option as well as other options. Please let us go back to how it was before. It was just fine as it was.",
            "At the moment I only play with 64 pieces, but I am over 80 and get a thrill on completion. I get through several a day. Since the update, it has become rubbish. After it stops working, which is often, it no longer returns you to the puzzle at the point at which you left off, it takes you back to the beginning - so frustrating. For me, it is ruined.",
            "Since you updated the Ap. It's been awful. Used to be able to see everything on one page, now it's only six. Got so p.off I uninstalled, and then reinstalled, now it's not only huge pieces but can't find 'edges' button to start the game properly . I also lost all the games I had completed. when will I go into my puzzles see only the one for today! NOT HAPPY JAN! Will look elsewhere, got to be something better out there.",
            "USE to love this game, since last update it sucks!Having the past months totally opened takes up too much room!The way it was before where we had to tap on the month to open it was better! The square to put pieces on keeps jumping around when I try to adjust size to lock. The pieces won't lock on the square without multiple times moving pieces & finally it will stick. Don't know why you needed to update EVERYTHING please put things back how they were! If it aint broke dont fix it!I miss my fun!",
            "Not sure what has happened with the last update. The pieces are more difficult to stick on the board now. I have to move the piece several times across the same spot on the board before it locks in place. It's so annoying. Also the board moves around too much to play without locking it in place. Please put it back the way it was and I'll glad Restore the 5 star rating!"

            "My favorite game, I literally deleted my other games because this is the only one I play now, I love it so much. Everything from how positive it is, to the perfectly fitting audio that plays. I love how simple and easy going this game is and I love how this games helps you succeed. The levels where you can locate items are super fun as well, recommending this game to everyone I know literally!!",
            "Caution. This game is really nicely crafted, very visually rich, and enjoyable to play from levels 1-10. After this, things start to go absolutely mental. There is pop-up after pop-up, harassing you about another new feature. You quickly get to a point where you're bamboozled - everything on the screen is shouting at you. This appears to be by design, hyper confusion and attention hijacking to nurture addiction. This app is nefarious and should be enjoyed only with huge restraint.",
            "Never log into Facebook. It causes you to lose the prizes from any contest you won. I had tons of things coming from a dots race and they vanished the second it connected to Facebook. Also, the game freezes and crashes a lot when watching videos to get a bonus box. You have to be patient when you open the app. It can take over five minutes to come up.",
            "Honestly was obsessed with this game for awhile, but they made a bunch of updates and now every time you view the map about four or five different windows pop up to tell you about the different games. It used to just be the daily bonus. Tired of exiting out of a bunch of stupid notifications just to be able to click on the game I want. They ruined a good thing.",
            "You get to a certain point and you can't win anything without spending money. With prices on everything else in life steadily increasing the last thing I wanna spend money on is a silly phone game. If you could just spend money once or twice, maybe no big deal. But you have to constantly spend money to get perks to help you thru the levels and clearly this is by design. It's a really cool game, and very disappointing to have to delete, but I'm just not up for money hungry games like this."

        "description": "The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a neurological scale that aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. A patient is assessed against the criteria of the scale, and the resulting points give a patient score between 3 (indicating deep unconsciousness) and either 14 (original scale) or 15 (the more widely used modified or revised scale).\r\n\r\nGCS was initially used to assess level of consciousness after head injury, and the scale is now used by first aid, EMS, and doctors as being applicable to all acute medical and trauma patients. In hospitals it is also used in monitoring chronic patients in intensive care.\r\n\r\nThe scale was published in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J.

        "descriptionHTML": "The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a neurological scale that aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. A patient is assessed against the criteria of the scale, and the resulting points give a patient score between 3 (indicating deep unconsciousness) and either 14 (original scale) or 15 (the more widely used modified or revised scale).<br><br>GCS was initially used to assess level of consciousness after head injury, and the scale is now used by first aid, EMS, and doctors as being applicable to all acute medical and trauma patients. In hospitals it is also used in monitoring chronic patients in intensive care.<br><br>The scale was published in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J.

            "Good game BUT ads. 30 second ad to start a game. 30 second ad to finish a game. If you minimize this game to check texts or phone, another 30 second ad to resume. So a minimum of one minute in ads. I like the daily challenges but on this game I have not figured out what it takes to win a game. It appears that you have to complete a game about 30 times before it counts as completed. It is an good game if you have a lot of spare time and not much else to do."

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

        "title": "Solitaire TriPeaks: Play Free Solitaire Card Games",
        "description": "Cards. They’ve been around for literally centuries. They have long-lasting appeal.\r\n\r\nSolitaire. Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke. \r\n\r\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttp://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "the new update is very good. easy to find tracks and quite organised.",
            "Just got it and already love it. Mellow zen quality music, no add interruptions, tons of choices, awesome images, and most songs are 1 hour - 3 hours long so this is the perfect app if you want long deep trances or meditation. Lots of hz options also. Thank you for this beautiful piece of calm in the crazy hectic world.",

            "Edit 20/05/16: Samsung S6 Edge updated and I can no longer access the test feature, which was why I wanted the app. Some labelled areas are not shaded correctly/at all. This leads to confusing situations where the referenced label for a test location is not actually selectable, or no shaded area comes up when looking for an associated area label which makes it a guessing game. Once these are fixed it is a 5 star app.",
            "The anatomy is sort of wrong in some parts. For example in the mid sagittal \nplane the ascenting ramus of the cingulate sulcus is labeled as the central \nsulcus, or cingulate gyrus is labeled also in the superior part of it where \nin reality there is the lateral part of superior frontal gyrus. If u have \nan exam or something serious I totally don't recommend cuz it will be \nconfusing and contrasting to more trustable sources",
            "If we repeatedly opening info box of different areas in one slide one after the other then issue arises    &  issue is, text information box of new labelled area is still showing the text of previous labelled area which can misleading information for people who have no aware of that function& anatomy.    To overcome the problem we need to get back to main menu or sometimes close the app and reopen it which is really annoying",

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

I maean there are \"lofi beats\" and all, but I suggest u should add some more music like the older ones, 'cause why not! This app has helped me improve as an individual. The music creates such atmosphere like........wow! I hope u all would consider this. Love u all!!! Thanks for being there!!",
            "I am surprised. I loved this app. Had it on my phone and forgot abt it til they sent me a reminder. There is a delay before starts or transitions sometimes which is ok, but makes you think nothing will play.

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

It&#39;s the same Fruit Ninja you know and love, but with gorgeous new visuals and tech! Slice fruit like never before in glorious high definition!<br><br>With this remake, we also have big plans for future updates that just weren&#39;t possible before. Stay tuned!",
        "comments": [
            "What the HELL is this new update? I thought this game was one of the few that weren't THAT outright money hungry, but now you removed the powers from all the blades and dojos I got from YEARS of hard work playing this game, just to introduce gems and loot boxes? The looks improved amazingly, they were truly outdated, but for the 10th anniversary instead of new exciting features you implement LOOT BOXES, HALFBRICK? You guys need help. Uninstalling and boycotting this everywhere I can.",
            "This used to be the height of childhood gameplay. The graphics USED to be fabulous, the menus USED to be well set up and intuitive, the missions USED to be fun. In other words, Fruit Ninja has been sllwly sinking lower and lower, and the recent 10th Anniversary Update has made it hit rock bottom.",
            "Gameplay wise the game is very fun. However one thing I've noticed in the new update is that you need to open loot boxes to get certain blades when all the blades used to use the level system. There shouldn't be a paywall for blades you once could unlock by playing normally in a previous update. Also this app stutters quite a lot and my phone usually handles games decently. For reference I'm using a samsung a20 for my device.",
            "Fruit ninja has always been one of my favourite games since the past so many years. Even my kids enjoy playing it. Two days back it got updated automatically. Shows upcoming additions. My only glitch is the new music when fruits arw cut. Can we have the old one back. This is not 'music to ears' as was the earlier one. Its disturbing and irritating, not in the flow of the game. Sync is also way off. Not in sync with when fruits are cut.",
            "Not impressed with the 10th anniversary update. The blades and dojos all seem to be the same. Some missions aren't registering your points and you can't change the missions as in the past. I'll give it a few more days to see if anything changes. But if not, I'll be deleting"

It's not perfect and it has flaws, such as a lot of micro transactions and all. That wouldn't be a problem if the PVE was just as good as the pvp. It would be amazing if the campaign got some love, I get that it's a farming zone for materials. But it would be really exciting to see some more chapters and more pve content.",
            "Really Good Game I really enjoy playing as you can replay characters to gain more coins if you don't want to spend actual money purchasing coins and notes. This is fun to play since it has maturity of the South Park characters like Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters and etc. If you keep struggling you can replay a old level. Enjoy this game since I enjoy watching South Park. Hope to see more things added to this game in the future. Good work.",
            "I've loved this game up until level 12, number 59! It keeps messing up and wont play right. The 1st castle guy wont die or show his health bar. It will just keep going on and on even when I have every card playing. Please fix this. Also I've spent so much money on this game & I thought the updates was supposed to help that. It hasn't! Last thing I'll b@&%h about is the pvp matchup is very unfair. Esp. when I'm not even level 4 & u match me with others who are way higher. I just dont get that!",
            "I give this game five stars because the graphics are great. One thing I really admire about this game is the character selection. They have so many people to collect and upgrade. As some one who really loves South Park it's good to know that they still keep the creativity and negativity, I thank everyone who created the show and this amazing game.",
            "KICK A**! I see all these negative comments, but it looks as though the game has been updated and fixed. And you don't have to spend actual money on this game to have fun, they give you so many options to earn what you need to upgrade your cards, earn money and C points and more. But you guys who complain are the younger generation from me. You don't understand games like I do. Im the keyboard cowboy...ironic name, hu? Lol anyways Creators, just wanna say thnx. But mostly to Matt & Trey."

Just prior to taking national, I sat in the parking lot & studied this app. Then, during national, I saw one of the questions from my study sesh in the parking lot! Highly recommend this app. Excellent rationale when reviewing individual answers & you have the option to \"star\" questions that you feel you need to touch up on.",

I'll update my review after I take National Registry. ***edit*** 7/21/19 The app reverted to the free version and erased all of my scores. I contacted the app publisher and am waiting on a response. I will leave the stars where they are for now while I wait to see what the publisher does. **** edit 7/25/19*** Shealyn kept working with me until my purchase was restored."

It's weird that you have to use gems for outfits the he apparently bought for you. You have to use diomands to flirt, have sex, go on a date; pretty much anything to make the storyline interesting will cost you diamonds, a lot of diomands!",

I've updated the app today & I've not played since morning bcoz of the problem I've spoken of . So plz help me fix it up so that I can at least play it tomorrow or the day after plz! Plz! Fix it up I don't want to end up deleting the app",

Since I'm using my house WiFi and it's speed but from today it has problems. If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",
            "I understand the world is just slowly starting to develop an open mind. But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

            "Edit: just found out that this is happening for all my Google pixel friends. Hope this is figured out soon, cause now my streaks are gone 😒 Uhh I reinstalled the app cause I needed to make room for something else at the moment, and I'm trying to get it back on my phone, and it's telling me my device is not supported??? (This was all on the same day btw). It's not like I even had a choice in whether or not to update my phone cause nothing would work without the update.",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 or 4 years now and I've never had any problems until now. I renewed my Amino+ membership and it wouldn't update or let me open the shop. I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",
            "Everytime I try to put a YouTube video on my post, or when I do a live video screening, the link is always saying that it's \"invalid.\" I've been having this problem for months and when I try getting in contact with customer service, they just send me a link to an help center which doesn't help in the slightest! This is so annoying!!!"

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

Fair does if it was every 5 levels or so but I actually spent more time watching ads than I have spent playing the game. That said, the games looks nice and works really well and the levels are good, easy at first but then you actually have to think about it. But not for me with adverts after literally every level, plus wherever else they pop up.. Thank you for reply.",
            "The game is good, but adds are too long. I spend 20 seconds solving a puzzle and have to wait through 2 minutes of adds. Once the adds are over I get to play again, but only for a few seconds before more adds.",
            "One puzzle that lasts 10 seconds or less. One advertisement with a 30.00 second timer that counts down. Sometimes two advertisements. The advertisements are for other games with advertismentses. 75% adds 25% ... im not entertained ... I'm gonna click a button and see more adveradvertisevertismentsestisements. Apps suck. Phones suck. The future sucks."

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

We update the game every week so don&#39;t forget to download the latest version to get all the sweet new features and levels!<br><br>New to the game? Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "Most questions good but not too difficult. Two annoyances are: Mini games between levels. Why? They are irrelevant to trivia. The second annoyance is that some of the tiles you are required to play are not trivia, but are simply games of chance. \"Click the chest to get more coins!\" But if you guess wrong, you lose a life...lose too many lives and the game shuts you down. This is super lame.",
            "Very entertaining. Even learning some new things so makes it worth it. Love how you have control over how hard you want the levels to be. That way its not too easy or too hard. Because when there's no level in between i usually just delete the app. It's the perfect game for me before bedtime, its the only game i've found that relaxes me and calms my brain so i can rest and my brain actually shuts off because it's tired. So yes i give 5🌟s thank you for the upload. I'll be keeping this one.",

I don't mind dropping a little $ once I've thoroughly researched an app. Runs smooth other than ads but it's great you're not immediately forced to pay for upgrades before really getting a chance to see if it's really an app for you. Very enjoyable!!",
            "Without doubt the best quiz app out there. I have had some problems with it freezing, I managed to get to level 540 and it would not go any further no matter what I did so I have had to start again from scratch. I've now managed over 100 levels and it's only crashed once so fingers crossed I'll keep my score and history without having to start again.",
            "As games go; this one is pretty good! You only have to watch ads when you get an answer wrong. I am on level 55. Each level has approximately 15+20 questions. You have little mini-games some times. If you win those you are asked if you want to double your score by watching an ad. When you answer a question, right or wrong, it gives an explanation to the question. So you can learn something. It is a little like the original board game of Trivia Pursuit. I think it's a good game."

            "This app is very good. I have installed other anatomy apps, but found the design is backward i.e they are designed to make you buy. As such they install a mass of garbage, which fails on many platforms and slows everything. This app. is lean and very well made. It is focused. Thanks",
            "So easy very good, efficient and effective way of remembering and learning the anatomy. Quiz questions are very informative and helpful.",
            "Very useful to understand our own body. It's easy for students to go hand to hand. It makes imagination easy. We are using it to train health workers with non medical background. They all who don't know English are happy with it. Good job.👍",

This is an unbelievable tool for anyone having to master a difficult subject matter like Anatomy. literally saved me !"

            "The entire game is a \"pay to win\" nightmare... It is designed to artificially limit your progress in as many ways as you can think of. You cant upgrade your units without \"shards\" which are completely random. Worse, there is also an insultingly low \"daily gold limit.\" Gold is also required to make any upgrades. Worse, if you try to fight without leveling up, you will actually LOSE all of your hard earned progress. THE ONLY WAY TO WIN THIS GAME, IS TO NEVER PLAY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!",
            "Normally I don't like these types of games (auto battlers), but this is actually the first one that I've enjoyed. The game has quite a bit of strategy to it and oozes quality. The monetization system is questionable of course, it's pay-to-win and that is why I will not spend any money on it (I would happily have had the game as a premium title instead) and the game will get old quite fast for me because of that. But for now it is quite fun.",
            "Its a expensive game and you will not win if you never pay that why i notice. The winning rate will totally drop and you will done nothing once you stop spending. Gain no experience as well when loosing in the season pass. They will give just a star for wagon which will take 4 to 8 hours. You will enjoy playing at first but will loose interest in the long run",
            "Great game, I've been playing for a couple of months now without spending a cent. Quite playable without paying, although progess is slow after reaching certain level. Good variety of units but simple enough to relax and enjoy. Also you choose if you want to watch adds for resources. My only complaint is that, lacking resources, it is difficult to upgrade units, and therefore change strategies, once you are at a certian level. But overall a great game!",
            "Update fail. Game now crashes immediately after the 1st splash screen. Anyway it's just a cash grab. The now rampamt \"battle pass\" last barely a week & doesnt grant enogu to be worth buying even if it lasted a month or more like most others do. No real strategy, just whoever buys the most, wins & no real game as combat is entirely automated."

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

I thought at one point you could overlay outer body so you could see where the organs are, but I can't see it now. The animation for digestion really just shows through the colon, not the whole system.

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",
            "Fun but the ads were annoying. I'd rather have a long ad that I can't skip than short ones every few seconds. I can't take it anymore. Uninstalling",
            "I bought the ad free version but it doesn't give you the option to sign in when downloaded to a new device and Google Play says I already own it and can't buy it again, not that I want to pay for it again.",
            "This is a really boring game. I hate it soooooooooo much and it's very annoying because you could only stick the couple a million bazillion times anyways make this game fun or exciting. Oof edited this and still it's so BORING and ANNOYING. Please upgrade it."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "It used to be a good game until the last update. Instead of the usual 25 diamonds reward players usually got, now it's only 5 diamonds. The most ridiculous thing is that now you have to watch ads in order to apply lipsticks for every single client. What is this? I've watched ads and paid gems for many of the lipstick colours before but now?? Basically have to repeat all of that but now it seems endless. This game becomes kind of unbearable to play now. Please bring back the older features.",
            "Fantastic and creative game but why so many adds?! Adds are too much, every 30 sec. and they cause the game to lag. Please consider our time too. Recently, I finally paid up for no adds and now my game is locking up constantly. Newest updates cost too much money and you don't win diamonds like we used to in tasks. Not happy with the direction this game has gone. Used to be my favorite fashion game. So, so sad. 2020.",
            "Very wonderful and my favourite game of all.....💐💐🧡 I am playing super stylish from many months . Last year I downloaded this game I reached till level 21 or 18 but the game was hanged it wasn't loading . So I had to delete my favourite game. Then again I wanted to download it this year then I was feeling angry I had to start now from level 1 again!! Then now I have reached level 10 . Please ensure that this game should hang once again !! Please! See to it .. but it is my favourite game!",
            "I love this game so much fun especially since I love fashion games and dancing games the adds are a little crazy but not that bad. It is a lil annoying having that in app purchase add pops up everytime u level up but that's ok I still absolutely love this game no doubt about it. Another thing can u do is make it so ur character has a name please. But no other complaints. :D",
            "Omg where to begin. I've reached level 80 and no longer get any clients and it's hard for me to get any collection. When i tried to install and play other apps recommended from the app itself and decided to uninstall the new game, super stylist got uninstalled as well and i had to start all over again and lost collections i used to have."

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",

Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "This is a really good app for psychology students like me to write reports with theories. But it could be better with references list at the end of every subject so it will be easier for us to search/write in our reports.",
            "This app is an excellent source of information taught in schools. The difference between school textbooks/classes and this app is the cost...the app is free! Thank you for this.",
            "Nice concept, user-friendly and educative but the developer needs to fix the reply section , I can't seem to repky or ask a question it shows \"Technical Error\" when I try to reply or ask a question. Pls fix 🙏🏼",
            "It's a good app. Most of the core content of the subject is covered. However, I looking for something with an element of Stats and Research methodology as well. If possible, please do add something on these topics also. Regards Manan"

            "There is a bug where I would watch an ad to get a free spin, but it would load forever after watching, and I wouldn't get another spin. Hopefully this gets fixed, but the game is really fun otherwise, but thats a pretty big bug.",
            "Very well designed App. Good food for brain. But lots lots of Ads. Once ½ of levels are completed more Ads (we can skip after 5 secs) will be pushed in between the levels. After completing ¾ levels, App hangs after playing AD (these are 30secs Ads). For designing, complexity this App deserves 5 stars, but for Ads that are being pushed 2 stars is more than enough. Ads are killing the interest.",
            "Good game I have fun playing during downtime when I go to school but way to many ads after 1 round theres a ad and when you skip it, it gets stuck loading and I have to close the game over and over again.",
            "Best mind relaxing game ever. Whenever I fell bored I always one option to play which is this one. The creator has made it upon the mind of an artiststic person because every artist wants some interesting thing to do as this game.",
            "Very fun game and the ads aren't terrible. But it keeps freezing (loading forever) after almost every ad watched, requiring me to close and report the game. So, when I try to earn extra spins by watching an ad, I get screwed every time."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "Ok I don't even care anymore. This is honestly a great game. But tone it down with the forced ads a bit. And the tranquilizer darts are too annoying. Nerf them please. And also, I think you should add at least these things. 1. Add a drill weapon for the normal vehicle. (Not the ultimate ones.) 2. Make it so you get 3 - 20 free gems every day. (I will love you if you do this.) last one. Add mythic and secret rarity parts. Mythic chances: 0.01383% Secret chances: 0.0000112% (add mythic boxes too.)",
            "I am a prestige 60 player. Played this game over a year to achieve that. Watch all the ads everyday. I am a gang leader as well. But since the day they introduce the purple darts, which makes players with them almost invincible. This whole game becomes a very uneven playing ground. Of the developer is not going to make playing this game fair. I will petition to get a lot of players to forever quit playing this game. Very dissapointed that I wasted one over years on you.",
            "Played this game for 1 and a half years. By the time they introduced the tranquilizer darts, the game becomes medium to EXTREMELY HARD. LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT ANYONE WITH IT. AND HOW CAN ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS IT!? CAN'T ADVANCE TO PRESTIGE 5 WITHOUT PLAYING THIS GAME FOR MONTHS!! very disappointed in you, C. A. T. S. At least nerf the gun. Reduce the stun time from five seconds to two, maybe. Help me out here because THIS IS THE EIGHTH WEEK OF TRYING TO ADVANCE TO STAGE 23.",
            "I'm hooked, my son is hooked, my daughter is hooked. Genuinely the best mobile game I've played. The adds were a bit intrusive in the beginning, but it is a free game after all and the gameplay kept me coming back regardless. After a few days I payed to remove them. Lets face it, the developers deserve support for such an excellent game. **Edit 27/10/20: they've added a couple of items (tranquiliser gun I'm looking at you!) that have horribly unbalanced the game, ruining the fun completely.",
            "I've played this game for like 2 or more years. Darts destroyed the gameplay even though I've got two from the grand prix. It just narrows down the game and downgrades it to less creative levels. Also, I think that I'm closest ever to deleting the game from my device at this point."

            "When I got this game years back, it was fun. Now, every time I get on it with no internet connection, it deletes my progress. I have to make sure I am on the internet or it deletes my stuff. It's a really good game.(Other than that one problem.)The problem is the reason I gave it 4 stars.",
            "Absolutely love this game, but one frustrating annoyance is the add that appears during the main game play for their other game, colour switch world. I paid for adds to be removed but this one remains and puts you off while playing as it takes up a lot of the bottom screen area and I often click on it accidently 😣 Remove this and happy to give top stars or at the very least have it on the main title only, just not on the main game screen 😡",
            "This game is highly addictive, may have very slight minor glitches, but is extremely fun to play, and I especially love how there are multiple different game modes to play, but overall, I continue to believe that this game is an addictive, extremely fun to play game for all of the family, which I csn guarantee, you will enjoy as well.",
            "When I first download this game it had a lot of potential, but it got boring very quickly as there was only one game mode, the classic. Now there are lots of game modes to choose from and there are lots of levels on each of them. You can customise your game by changing your character, and the ads are far enough spread out that it doesn't bother you. The game is very straightforward but still fun the only thing you need to be able to do is tap the screen in any place you like. Highly recommended",
            "Edit 2: after over a month, I'm still shown ads even though I paid to remove them. Finally uninstalled the app. Edit 1: after a recent update I'm seeing ads on the game homepage even though I've paid to remove ads. Original: Exactly what I want in a simple game. But the other day, all my local high scores got reset..."

            "To play without ads, turn off your wifi and data; That being said, I would have given it a 5 as I used to REALLY enjoy this game, but as of today I do not. For whatever reason, it now removes and rearranges the tubes once you have filled a color. I do NOT like this, it is havoc on my brain/eyesight.",
            "Great game. Loads of ads, so you'll need to pay to get rid of them. It is worth the free, however, you still have to watch ads when you get enough percentage to unlock the test tubes. Hence my lower star rating. Surely you should be able to unlock without watching adds when you've paid for no adds? Big downside!",
            "Really nicely done. You'll usually have difficult levels interspaced with a few easy ones, so every time you pick it up you find the game challenging and rewarding, great flow. The sound effects are perfect too. Given the time it often takes to complete a level I don't find the ads too obtrusive either.",
            "Too much irritating by ads, why don't you stop ads displaying on my screen. While I play this game to stop my mobile data button, is it ok for you. Try to imporve your game, I can't suggest to play this game to anyone of my friends & relatives. If in case iam going to suggest this game and they are all facing same problem like what Iam facing problem with this game. They all beàt me very hard. Because this is too much irritating by ads playing between game to game. Can check it or not tell me."

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

        "description": " Reasons for knee pain \r\n\r\nIf you’re not dealing with a specific injury—say, a torn ACL—sorting out knee pain can seem complicated. The knee is composed of two joints: the tibiofemoral joint, between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), and the patellofemoral joint, between the femur and patella (knee cap). Each is an anchor point for multiple tendons, fascia, and other structures, including the IT band. If you have bad biomechanics, typically caused by a muscle imbalance, especially weak glutes, repetitive movement can irritate structures in the knee and lead to what is broadly known as anterior knee pain—a catchall category for general pain in the front of the knee.  \r\nThe stabilizer muscles for the knee, counterintuitively, are in the hips. When those muscles are weak or imbalanced, they can’t keep your knee properly aligned. “If you’re not able to control the position of your leg as your foot makes contact with the ground, pedal, or rock, it can result in increased stress to the structures of the knee. To further complicate the issue, once the pain signals your brain that there’s a problem, this can lead to further compensations in response to the irritation, which can shut off key muscles and tighten up other structures.\r\n\r\n Explanation of all the muscles that need to be strengthened and why: \r\n\r\n\r\nQuadriceps.\r\n\r\nThey cover the front of the thigh, cross the kneecap and form a tendon known as the patellar tendon. The quadriceps muscles allow you to extend or straiten the knee. If there is a weakness or tightness in the quadriceps you will get pain and stress in the joint as you go upstairs or get up from a chair.\r\n\r\nHip adductor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Adductors allow you to adduct your leg or bring it to the midline of the body. They help to stabilise the hip joint and help maintain the body in a stationary position.\r\n\r\nHip flexor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Flexor muscles allow you to flex your hip. Hip Flexor muscles come from the spine and the pelvis and attach to the upper thigh bone. If the hip flexors are tight or weak they can pull the thigh out of its proper alignment. This in turn pulls the kneecap out of its groove causing knee pain.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles allow you to bend the knee and also extend your hip. Most importantly strong hamstring muscles will help you protect a very important ligament called the ACL.\r\n\r\nGastrocnemius muscle.\r\n\r\nPeople with weak calf muscles often complain of pain in the front of the knee around the patellar tendon area.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius allows you to perform activities including hip abduction and hip external rotation. When you’re walking you’re only on one foot at any given time. The Gluteus medius help you to stabilise your pelvis. If it’s weak you get a drop in your hip and that causes stress on the knee.\r\n\r\nGluteus maximus.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to extend your hip and externally rotate your hip. If the Gluteus maximus muscles are weak other muscles in the back of the leg tend to take over and you end up with overly active hamstrings and tight hamstrings lead to knee pain.",

Whether you want to improve your general brain health and memory[1][2], enhance your problem solving abilities[3], reduce your risk of Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s[4][5][6][7], or bend metal and shoot lasers with your mind – exercise has an important role to play in all but two of those activities. In particular, richer fitness regimens – regimens consisting of aerobic and resistance training methods[8][1], produce the greatest overall improvements in cognitive performance and neurochemical brain processes. Note, however, working out for sixteen hours each day won’t turn you into the next Stephen Hawking. There are diminishing returns[9], and the favorable cerebral environment promoted by exercise is only as good as the active learning that accompanies it.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that exercise has been found to improve a wide range of general health conditions[15][16][17][18][19][20][21], so too does it have wide and positive impacts across the brain. Its effects extend across vascular[22][23], metabolic[24][25], inflammatory[26] [24] and stress-regulating[27] pathways as they exist in the brain. Exercise has been shown to enhance neuronal metabolic and mitochondrial functioning[28][25], decrease oxidative stress in the hippocampus[29][27], and increase mitochondrial machinery[28]. Another way of saying this: working out helps improve the power supply, the work environment and workers themselves in neuronal ‘train stations.’ On the other end, stress, and chronic stress in particular, has been linked to impaired functioning of, and indeed damage to, the hippocampus[27]. Exercise has shown favorable benefits in the regulation of stress (and in particular the management of corticosteroid processes – e.g. cortisol)[27], and may also favorably affect hippocampal memory systems through this process (also potentially leading to improvements in mood and attention if not intelligence). \r\n\r\nMore specific to the process of memory formation and the underlying neuronal structure, exercise has been found to increase levels of hippocampal neurotrophins[32]. Neurotrophins are a class of growth factors centrally important in the development and health of neurons[33]. In particular, increases in a neurotrophin called brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been linked to neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons) and improved synaptic plasticity[32][24] [34], producing substantial improvements in memory[24]. In turn, exercise has been found to up-regulate levels of hippocampal BDNF[34]- and much of its impact on memory appears to stem from this process[35]. To make a wild analogy and a gross, but potentially useful, simplification – BDNF is to neurogenesis as testosterone is to muscle growth. \r\n\r\nInsulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is another compound which has been found to enhance neurogenesis and plasticity processes[36][37], and it is similarly upregulated through working out[38][39][40]. Not only does strenuous physical activity lead to positive increases in these compounds, but it can also help regulate hormones which indirectly support them. Active fitness workouts have been shown to help maintain levels of testosterone and estrogen[41][42], which have also been shown to help favorably regulate levels of neurotrophins and neurogenesis [43][44][45][41]. Taken together, the neuronal and synaptic plasticity promoted by these compounds ultimately work to facilitate some of the basic processes of cognition, learning and memory formation such as Long Term Potentiation, or ‘LTP. Exercise appears to have has favorable effects on LTP [46][47][48], most likely mediated by its positive effects on synaptic plasticity generally.\r\n\r\nTo see more on how physical activity impacts cognitive fitness, mood, attention and intelligence see http://www.bodbot.com/Cognitive_Health.html",

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "I used to play this before and i just dowloaded it again. But there is a glitch. You cant get past level 5 which is the shield boss. Once u die on the level, the robot comes to save you and it is supposed to kill the zombie but now, the robot causes no damage. Had to delete the game because clearly there is a bug.",
            "So far it s a great game, i am now at stage 400+, but there is something i want to request... regarding the green chip and blue chip, my weapon are already legend and can only be step up using only yellow, pink and colorful chip to become mythic.. my green and blue chip are useless.. so can you please put an NPC that i can trade a certain amount of green to become blue chip then blue into yellow and so on, so that those chip still be useful. Hope you can grant my request, thanks much.",
            "Fun game IF REWARD VIDEO was AVAILABLE. I don't care if it isn't available give me the reward without the video... I have played many other games that don't run out of videos like this game. Awesome game, if everything worked like it does sometimes. I had tornado gun at lvl 250 an got the bounce gun, but it only went to lvl 220 an wants items to rank up, but every previous gun would level up to the same lvl of the gun I had. Guess it's a way to try an cheat money out of people...",
            "When I try to get triple reward, open chests or anything that requires opening an ad; it says REWARDED video is not ready. I also made a purchase but did not get the secondary weapon!!! Last but not least, you can turn off the music but why do you have to if there is no music at all 🤣 Even after the recent update, the problem still exists",
            "At stage 5 the shielded boss came and my shots are useless. No clue/tutorial to fight him. After 30min, out of frustration I charge myself toward him. Health gone but nothing happens. 10min later I was so frustrated and ready end it all, charged towards the boss, then surprise2, a robot came down. The robot damage the boss so slightly it takes 15 min to kill it. Clearly this game made by a brainless zombie"

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

I understand trying to keep the game updated and fresh; but to screw over existing players is not cool. And though I use Wi-Fi, I find it takes forever to get in and at times find myself getting stuck when it's uploading to the next game play.",

There are invisible players spawnkilling everyone, and there's a really annoying bug on the first spawn of every match; I always have to wait for someone to kill me so I can spawn and go help my team. And now, the Sniper Scopes (6x and 8x) shakes way too much, making it impossible for snipers to stabilize their aim right on the target without getting too vulnerable, please, fix this.",

Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, \"sounding out\" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads. Often these difficulties are first noticed at school. When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia. The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn. Dyslexia is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood as the result of a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.",

It may begin in adulthood as the result of a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain&#39;s language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.",

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

I have only been able to do the practice mode and in the first puzzle of normal, hard and expert there is one level in the 1st picture that has something wrong with it so you can't compete the picture and all the other levels are locked because you can't finish the pictures. Can you fix it please.",
            "I absolutely loved this app, until I opened it this morning. It completely changed! It was simple and classic, just strategy games without the fuss the other games had. Granted I had to watch horrible ads for mindless junk games, but they weren't all the time. Now I have pop ups about bonuses and levels and BAH! I do not want games that reflect the glitz and flashy of a casino floor. I want to just play a classic, using your brain, game. So disappointed.",
            "The classic number puzzle game has a great layout and is easy to play. It was also a very pleasant surprise to find over a dozen other very cool games to play along with this app!!! A very big thumbs up from me. 👍🤠👍 You guys went above and beyond with this app it deserves a big 7* stars!!!",
            "It's a really good app . Very enjoyable it contains a lot of games I love stalk stick the most. Other games r also nice, but there r a lot of ads I am tired of it and why one star is missing. Once the ads are removed u will get 5 full stars, very disappointed 😭😭.",

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

This app does a great job at extracting files that have been compressed, and supports all the common compression algorithms. In my opinion it is the best on android, even better than some paid options. I appreciate how it all I am not constantly reminded to give it a rating or upgrade to a paid option. I would highly recommend this app.",
            "VERY nice and good app user freindly interface. The best file manager in the universe. Mind blowing and very very outstanding app. HAs a lot of features like dark mode light mode and i recommend everybody to download it. The reason for giving 4 stars is it is missing one thing. Literally this file manager is missing one thing that many people. Literally it does not have Root explorer. After a few months of my old review they have even added root explorer now. Now you deserve 5 stars man. LOVE",

Or select a previously unlocked car to play with. I would like to be able to play with that one vehicle as much as I want. Yes I know about the whole upgrade system thing. Where when you upgrade something it fully heals your car. Lastly, please remove the fuel system. I would like to play longer than 12 times at a time. Other than that its fine."

        "description": "You can enjoy first recording for free permanently. Other tracks are also free to you within a month.\r\n\r\nAre you self conscious and afraid to exercise? Do you find yourself eating even when you're not hungry? Our program reduces the seeds of self consciousness and creates a mentality conducive to self-discipline. What would you do if you had less hunger, less compulsive eating, less stress, and more compulsion to exercise and be active?  You know you won't let yourself down.  Act thinner and you'll be thinner. This is the one.\r\n\r\nIf you have a weight problem, your mind likely already sees your body as beyond its control.  They key to every weight loss success story is there was one \"magic cure\" that users truly believed in.  Are all these \"magic cures\" real but only for a select few?  No.  The common thread in them all is self determination.  The key is not finding the magic cure, but creating it within yourself.  You can quite literally think yourself thin.  Just in the same way Yogis are able to walk on hot coals without being damaged or slow down their own metabolisms to heal from within, you can lose weight based on brain patterns.  Think it and you will be it.  But thinking it isn't easy for some who have lived with the difficulty of an uncooperative metabolism for so many years.  And unfair standards in the media only make it more difficult to appreciate yourself and feel healthy so you can be happy.\r\n\r\nThe ABSOLUTE most important aspect of weight maintenance is your mindset.  If weight loss is something you go into as a battle, looking to defeat your own body through starvation and torturous unnatural dietary supplements (which often damage your digestive system), your body will rebel against you.  If you think of weight loss as a burden, and exercise as a chore, you will be dissatisfied and tired before you even start.  The only way to get your body to do what you want is to cooperate with it.  No one's body wants to be unhealthy and lethargic.  Our system teaches you how to love physical activity and keep loving it.  A temporary diet yields temporary (if any) results.  Don't gain the weight back.  Get a new body AND a new mindset!\r\n\r\nUsing these recordings is easy.  Do not focus on your weight, or any negative feelings you may have about your body.  Instead, imagine yourself having a healthy body.  What would that be like?  Don't focus on the negative, but rather use your imagination to think about all the things you'd love to do with your new body.  Don't think of words such as \"Weight,\" \"Heavy,\" \"Fat,\" or anything \"Negative.\"  Use positive terms such as \"Now I have a healthy body,\" and \"I look and feel great.\"  Think in positive terms about your future, and your new lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThese recordings are made to assist you with the psychological aspects of weight loss.  The distinct array of frequencies helps the brain obtain and maintain both motivation and satisfaction without the need to eat.  It helps you cancel out the association of \"food\" being used as an unhealthy emotional fixation.  Our recordings do work, and as such you will be able to feel this programmable state within minutes of the very first use.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nPlease remember that Weight Loss Brainwave is merely a tool to assist in your rejuvenation. The sessions within the app are in no way a substitute for your doctor, but only an addition to assisting with your health on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level.

            "Amazing! The way each level tricks your mind is just incredible. Makes you think outside the box and also to NOT think so hard. Once you get the answer 🤦‍♀️ Hint: use your phone's natural ability to help you ! For example, give it a little shake and apples may fall off the tree on your screen! I won't lie, its challenging at times but great for exercising your brain and testing your patience! Give it a try! I did and I'm hooked!",
            "In my personal utmost opinion it's a nice relaxing game to play when one is bored or if you've had a bad day at school or work you can play this fun brain puzzles. It's also something that's good for all ages so that kids, teenagers, young adults, middle age people and old people can play it that way it's inclusive and allows one to think strategically. I've had this app on my phone for I don't know about 4 months, I randomly saw it when I was playing virtual families 2. Pretty strange I know hu",
            "It's fun to a point. Some of the puzzles are really silly and you're shaking your phone or actually dragging items from \"out of the games zone\" such as a letter from up in the header of your phone. Which is quite ingenious but some of it gets repetitious. Likable for me through about level 100. Its starting to bore me slightly now. But I'd definitely recommend it for a good one or two hours of fun",
            "Great game some people moan about the ads but theirs not even much ads I really recommend it please download the app it's a great app very mind tricking if your in to that then what are you waiting for!? Download this app right now!! Ignore the bad reviews the developer needs to make money some how and no I'm not making if up because of the bad reviews it's an amazing app so.... what are you doing stop reading this and go and download the app please it's an amazing app and I love it!",
            "I enjoyed the game. I have patience for irritating ads because I know I will have fun when it's done. I wish there were more levels because I completed the game, but I really had fun. Not tooooo ez not tooooo hard. Just brain candy. Thanks for a fun way to kill time."

        "description": "Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is a neuropsychological test used to assess capacity and rate of information processing and sustained and divided attention. It is also developed to assess the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on cognitive functioning and other neurological disorders, a challenging task that involves working memory, attention and arithmetic capabilities.\r\nThe task for the testing subject is to add each number to the previous one  (span 2), or the previous second (span 3) or the previous third (span 4). For example, given the numbers 1, 7, 5, 4, the tested adds the first two numbers (1 + 7) and answers 8; then he should add the second two numbers (7 + 5) and answer 12; then the third two ones (5 + 4) and gets 9, and so on. This test assesses attention and vigilance because the testing subject is required not only to pay attention to the relevant stimuli (numbers) but also to changes in the ongoing presentation. The PASAT is an extremely sensitive measure of vigilance; however, it involves working on short‐term memory too, because the patient must \"hold\" in short‐term memory the preceding number while formulating an answer. You can choose the language in which you can listen to the numbers (English, French, Deutsch, Italian), time (2, 4 or 6 seconds), span (2, 3 or 4) and the numbers the tested has to listen to (10, 20 or 40).\r\nTouch and hold \"Main menu\" or result to go back or copy entire list into clipboard.",

I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

            "This app is super cool! You get to make lots of cool videos but... If you wanted to save them you have to pay. Like 4.99 and 10.99 or 35.99$ for some people that can be alot and that's just if you want TO SAVE the video YOU MADE. But there is some really cool templates. But I really wish I could of given this app a 5 star or at least a 4 star but no I had to give it a 3 stars. :(",
            "This app is great! It exports your videos very quickly, but I'm giving this a 4 star review because it doesn't really let you pick the music you want, it already gives you music with a type of style. Then again, this app is amazing and doesn't cost money to do the videos, so great job :)",
            "I just downloaded this app and it seems pretty cool and fun but it's already having some issues and it's only been five minutes. I picked out a few photos for a video and after pushing play the music in the video started skipping right away it only played part of it then kicked me out.",
            "This truly is a great app I realised that you don't exactly have to pay for everything even though there is a pro option it's perfectly fine because you don't have to pay for it and a lot of the templates are actually just for Free really good and you can remove the watermark too",
            "Extreamly beautiful app i have ever seen before for beat edting... But i suggest please add the favourite option in which users can add their favorite templates. And search option As well. Such an amazing Application. 😘😍 Thank you"

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

        "comments": [
            "Game is fun but there a lot of bugs that need fixing. You need to put in full directions to the game. 2nd is that I had a starship that I got and fully upgraded and then once I left a star base on a level it put me in another ship that I had bought before. So then I had to pay $520,000 to get the ship I'd already bought. It'd be great to get that currency back seeing I paid for the same ship 2 times",
            "Was going great then I lost the ship I bought. As another review I had earned enough credits then told me I couldn't buy the ship. Bought a cheaper ship and went through. Then I went to play it and it's gone. My progress in the galaxy beta was still the same. So not sure if I will keep playing this game.",
            "Sorry about my other review on other game that was my sister- not sure how she got into my tablet this is a great game but I think That if you buy pulse phasers then it should actually show pulse phaser fire cause with the defiant class style of ship I wanted to make it authentic as possible but when I went in to battle still had a stand phaser strip style of fire the defiant does have standard phaser strip style weaponry still would be cool if you added that other wise cool game!!!",
            "Dropped my review to 2 stars because I have been having issues purchasing a new ship in the beta mode. Tells me I don't have enough credits even though the price of the ship is less than the total credits I have. Reached out to the support email listed on here and included a screen shot of the error message and still have not heard back. So far seems like support is non existent.",
            "My favourite game so far! Am pretty addicted to Stellar Trek. Only two things I don't uderstand: can't switch between the regular and Beta games while in the app and every now and then, my points don't accurately represent my position related to all other players."

When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

The constant involvement and support received\r\nfrom Vietnamese medical and rehabilitation professionals in the development process ensured\r\ncontextualization and ownership of these guidelines as they brought in not only their technical\r\nexpertise but also their knowledge and experiences on the Vietnamese context and the local\r\nneeds and resources.\r\nTwo types of documents have been developed. Besides the General Rehabilitation Guidelines,\r\nwhich provide wide-ranging recommendations on care provision and quality principles, more\r\n“Technical” Guidelines have also been produced for each of the targeted conditions. These\r\ntechnical guidelines are specific to one \"type\" of care (physiotherapy, occupational therapy,\r\nspeech and language therapy; and for some conditions medical and nursing care as well). They\r\nprovide rehabilitation professionals with more specific, detailed technical guidance, allowing\r\nthem to better understand their specific role in the general rehabilitation approach and the\r\nprovision of multi-disciplinary, person-centred and evidence-based care.\r\nThe result of this process is a comprehensive set of guidelines that we hope will be widely\r\nspread and support all rehabilitation actors in providing better and higher quality care to the\r\npeople in need.\r\nThe present English version of the Rehabilitation Guidelines has been developed with valued\r\nsupport from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. It is our hope that the Vietnamese version of\r\nthe respective guidelines will be officially endorsed by the Ministry as national guidelines for\r\nrehabilitation care of persons with brain lesions.",

Often these difficulties are first noticed at school. When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia.

Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers.

            "Great concept, but app needs a lot of work. Esp for price. End date needs fixing. Often sets to date in past or current date. Should be option for infinity on daily tasks or to type in date. Should be able to choose own alarm tone and frequency. Every min too much. Also I need a reminder of each step in my repeated tasks, but when I check it as completed on one day, it is still ticked off on future days. This doesn't help me remember if I did that task that day or not.",
            "I have updated the app and since I bought it, I have not been able to set a reoccurring reminder it only shows up for the day not anything beyond that I want a refund",
            "Modified one instance of a repeated task. Application reset date to the year 1860 and stopped responding. Force stopped application, now all of my cards are gone. The core function of this application is to maintain timing and memory. Using the features presented by the interface should not demolish both. I would have expected some kind of redundancy or other methods to recover from whatever failure. Some medical device this is if my memory is more reliable.",
            "Like the 2 most recent negative reviews it shut down on me about 2 seconds after I installed it. When I opened it a second time I got to the 3rd screen of the tutorial and it shut down again. I emailed support. I'm curious to see if they will respond. I was attempting to try it out for friend just diagnosed with lewy body dementia. This is not going to help.",
            "Love the app setup - visually \"tangible\". Good for ADD/ADHD. Saw some neg reviews, but wanted to try on my Samsung Tab A. So far-great!! Repeating notification-best of any app I've seen, pleasant but noticeable to me, but prob not other ppl. Free trial exp notification pops up but not in the way, app price is reasonable. If you have probs w/the app, try restarting your phone, clear the app cache & uninstall/reinstall the app."

        "title": "Imaging Brain, Skull & Craniocervical Vasculature",
        "description": "This App presents normal imaging variations of the brain, skull, and craniocervical vasculature. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) have advanced dramatically in the past 10 years, particularly in regard to new techniques and 3D imaging. One of the major problems experienced by radiologists and clinicians is the interpretation of normal variants as compared with the abnormalities that the variants mimic.

        "descriptionHTML": "This App presents normal imaging variations of the brain, skull, and craniocervical vasculature. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) have advanced dramatically in the past 10 years, particularly in regard to new techniques and 3D imaging. One of the major problems experienced by radiologists and clinicians is the interpretation of normal variants as compared with the abnormalities that the variants mimic. Through an extensive collection of images, this app offers a spectrum of appearances for each variant with accompanying 3D imaging for confirmation; explores common artifacts on MR and CT that simulate disease; discusses each variant in terms of the relevant anatomy; and presents comparison cases for the purpose of distinguishing normal findings from abnormalities. It includes both common variants as well as newly identified variants that are visualized by recently developed techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging and multidetector/multislice CT.
