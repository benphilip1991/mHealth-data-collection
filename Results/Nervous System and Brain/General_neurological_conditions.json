        "description": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is damage to or disease affecting nerves, which may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function, or other aspects of health, depending on the type of nerve affected. Common causes include systemic diseases (such as diabetes or leprosy), vitamin deficiency, medication (e.g., chemotherapy, or commonly prescribed antibiotics including Metronidazole and the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Levaquin, Avelox etc.), traumatic injury, including ischemia, radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, Coeliac disease, or viral infection. It can also be genetic (present from birth) or idiopathic (no known cause). In conventional medical usage, the word neuropathy (neuro-, \"nervous system\" and -pathy, \"disease of\") without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy affecting just one nerve is called \"mononeuropathy\" and neuropathy involving nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body is called \"symmetrical polyneuropathy\" or simply \"polyneuropathy\". When two or more (typically just a few, but sometimes many) separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called \"mononeuritis multiplex\", \"multifocal mononeuropathy\", or \"multiple mononeuropathy\", mononeuritis multiplex.",

        "title": "Neuropsychology",
        "description": "Neuropsychology is the study of the structure and function of the brain as they relate to specific psychological processes and behaviours. It is an experimental field of psychology that aims to understand how behavior and cognition are influenced by brain functioning and is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders. Whereas classical neurology focuses on the physiology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind.

        "descriptionHTML": "Neuropsychology is the study of the structure and function of the brain as they relate to specific psychological processes and behaviours. It is an experimental field of psychology that aims to understand how behavior and cognition are influenced by brain functioning and is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders. Whereas classical neurology focuses on the physiology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind. It thus shares concepts and concerns with neuropsychiatry and with behavioral neurology in general. The term neuropsychology has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been applied in efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or groups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human patients). It makes use of neuroscience, and shares an information processing view of the mind with cognitive psychology and cognitive science.<br><br>In practice, neuropsychologists tend to work in research settings (universities, laboratories or research institutions), clinical settings (medical hospitals or rehabilitation settings, often involved in assessing or treating patients with neuropsychological problems), or forensic settings or industry (often as clinical-trial consultants where CNS function is a concern).<br><br>Support Language:<br><br><br>- العربية<br>- català<br>- Čeština<br>- Deutsch<br>- English<br>- Español<br>- فارْسِى<br>- Bulgarian<br>- français<br>- finland<br>- hungarian<br>- italiano<br>- 日本語<br>- 한국어<br>- Nederlands<br>- Norsk<br>- polski<br>- Português<br>- Русский<br>- slovenský<br>- slovenski<br>- Svenska<br>- Türkçe<br>- українська",

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

        "description": "Diagnosis\r\nA key component of a diagnostic assessment is self-reporting about symptoms, as well as the information that a close family member or friend can provide about symptoms and their impact on daily life. Additionally, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is based on tests your doctor administers to assess memory and thinking skills.\r\n\r\nLaboratory and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes or help the doctor better characterize the disease causing dementia symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe entire set of diagnostic tools is designed to detect dementia and determine with relatively high accuracy whether Alzheimer's disease or another condition is the cause. Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed with complete certainty after death, when microscopic examination of the brain reveals the characteristic plaques and tangles.\r\n\r\nTests\r\nA diagnostic work-up would likely include the following tests:\r\n\r\nPhysical and neurological exam\r\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam and likely assess overall neurological health by testing the following:\r\n\r\nReflexes\r\nMuscle tone and strength\r\nAbility to get up from a chair and walk across the room\r\nSense of sight and hearing\r\nCoordination\r\nBalance\r\nLab tests\r\nBlood tests may help your doctor rule out other potential causes of memory loss and confusion, such as a thyroid disorder or vitamin deficiencies.\r\n\r\nMental status and neuropsychological testing\r\nYour doctor may conduct a brief mental status test or a more extensive set of tests to assess memory and other thinking skills. Longer forms of neuropsychological testing may provide additional details about mental function compared with people of a similar age and education level. These tests are also important for establishing a starting point to track the progression of symptoms in the future.\r\nTreatment\r\nDrugs\r\nCurrent Alzheimer's medications can help for a time with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes. Two types of drugs are currently used to treat cognitive symptoms:\r\n\r\nCholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs work by boosting levels of cell-to-cell communication by preserving a chemical messenger that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer's disease. The improvement is modest.\r\n\r\nCholinesterase inhibitors may also improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation or depression. Commonly prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon).\r\n\r\nThe main side effects of these drugs include diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and sleep disturbances. In people with cardiac conduction disorders, serious side effects may include cardiac arrhythmia.\r\n\r\nMemantine (Namenda). This drug works in another brain cell communication network and slows the progression of symptoms with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It's sometimes used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Relatively rare side effects include dizziness and confusion.\r\nSometimes other medications such as antidepressants may be prescribed to help control the behavioral symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.\r\nCreating a safe and supportive environment\r\nAdapting the living situation to the needs of a person with Alzheimer's disease is an important part of any treatment plan. For someone with Alzheimer's, establishing and strengthening routine habits and minimizing memory-demanding tasks can make life much easier.\r\n\r\nYou can take these steps to support a person's sense of well-being and continued ability to function:\r\n\r\nAlways keep keys, wallets, mobile phones and other valuables in the same place at home, so they don't become lost.\r\nKeep medications in a secure location. Use a daily checklist to keep track of dosages.\r\nArrange for finances to be on automatic payment and automatic deposit.\r\nCarry a mobile phone with location capability so that a caregiver can track its location. Program important phone numbers into the phone.\r\nMake sure regular appointments are on the same day at the same time as much as possible.",

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

        "description": "Neurosurgery Test Prep 2020 Ed\r\n\r\nKey Features of this APP: \r\n• At practice mode you can see the explanation describing the correct answer.\r\n• Real exam style full mock exam with timed interface\r\n• Ability to create own quick mock by choosing the number of MCQ’s.\r\n• You can create your profile and see your result history with just one click.\r\n• This app contains large number of question set that covers all syllabus area.\r\n\r\nNeurosurgery of the spine covers the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. Spondylosis is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal vertebral discs are removed with special rongeurs. This procedure is known as a discectomy. Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the disc space to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs. Laminectomy is the removal of the Lamina portion of the vertebrae of the spine in order to make room for the compressed nerve tissue.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nRadiology assisted spine surgery uses minimally-invasive procedures. They include the techniques of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in which certain types of spinal fractures are managed.[23] Potentially unstable spines will need spine fusions. At present these procedures include complex instrumentation. Spine fusions could be performed as open surgery or as minimally invasive surgery. Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion is a common surgery that is performed for disc disease of cervical spine.[24] However, each method described above may not work in all patients. Therefore, careful selection of patients for each procedure is important. It has to be noted that if there is prior permanent neural tissue damage spinal surgery may not take away the symptoms.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nSurgery for chronic pain is a sub branch of functional neurosurgery.

Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. Spondylosis is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal vertebral discs are removed with special rongeurs. This procedure is known as a discectomy. Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the disc space to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs. Laminectomy is the removal of the Lamina portion of the vertebrae of the spine in order to make room for the compressed nerve tissue.[citation needed]<br><br>Radiology assisted spine surgery uses minimally-invasive procedures. They include the techniques of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in which certain types of spinal fractures are managed.[23] Potentially unstable spines will need spine fusions. At present these procedures include complex instrumentation. Spine fusions could be performed as open surgery or as minimally invasive surgery. Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion is a common surgery that is performed for disc disease of cervical spine.[24] However, each method described above may not work in all patients. Therefore, careful selection of patients for each procedure is important. It has to be noted that if there is prior permanent neural tissue damage spinal surgery may not take away the symptoms.[citation needed]<br><br>Surgery for chronic pain is a sub branch of functional neurosurgery. Some of the techniques include implantation of deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, peripheral stimulators and pain pumps.[citation needed]<br><br>Surgery of the peripheral nervous system is also possible, and includes the very common procedures of carpal tunnel decompression and peripheral nerve transposition. Numerous other types of nerve entrapment conditions and other problems with the peripheral nervous system are treated as well",

        "description": "This app Color Atlas of Skin Diseases - Dermatology Atlas is for medical student, doctors, dermatologist, nurses and other health practitioners to understand Dermatology Atlas with Treatment. The cases contain pictures (Zoom in/Out of illustrated color images), etiology and treatment of many skin infections.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2. History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nDon't forget to share it with other doctors.",

Treatment must be highly customized to the needs of the individual and may include oral medications, chemodenervation botulinum neurotoxin injections, physical therapy, or other supportive therapies, and surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation.",

Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. Spondylosis is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal vertebral discs are removed with special rongeurs. This procedure is known as a discectomy. Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the disc space to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs. Laminectomy is the removal of the Lamina portion of the vertebrae of the spine in order to make room for the compressed nerve tissue.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nRadiology assisted spine surgery uses minimally-invasive procedures. They include the techniques of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in which certain types of spinal fractures are managed.[23] Potentially unstable spines will need spine fusions. At present these procedures include complex instrumentation. Spine fusions could be performed as open surgery or as minimally invasive surgery. Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion is a common surgery that is performed for disc disease of cervical spine.[24] However, each method described above may not work in all patients. Therefore, careful selection of patients for each procedure is important. It has to be noted that if there is prior permanent neural tissue damage spinal surgery may not take away the symptoms.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nSurgery for chronic pain is a sub branch of functional neurosurgery. Some of the techniques include implantation of deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, peripheral stimulators and pain pumps.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nSurgery of the peripheral nervous system is also possible, and includes the very common procedures of carpal tunnel decompression and peripheral nerve transposition. Numerous other types of nerve entrapment conditions and other problems with the peripheral nervous system are treated as well",

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "Had an appt for my daughter with the EAP that we waited a couple of weeks for. I downloaded the app and set up an account a week in advance. We joined our appt 15 min early. When the appt time came the provider's video wouldn't connect. We were connected to wifi and had a strong signal. We kept waiting and about 10 min after appt time we got a notification that the provider had canceled the appt. We didn't get a call, the appt was just canceled due to the provider's connectivity problem.",
            "I have had many telehealth appointments and always something happens with the connection or the volume of the voice. It's very difficult when you are trying to do psychotherapy about trauma and halfway through the connection dies or you can't hear your provider anymore. This needs lots of work!",
            "The only frustrating part was they say they treat everything...except earaches...go figure. My doc office didnt want to see me, they sent me to this app....I've lived long enough to know I dont like this techno filled world. Just too odd for this old gal. Now headed to instacare."

However if you add some option by which user can repeat the mcqs later which he has wronged,it would be helpful.Whenever I chose FCPS forum option my app kept crashing and I thought the app was not working.

After first year they convinced to keep the subscription and I did just as a added value and not because I needed it. Then came the pandemic, time when you actually need it. The service quality fell faster than a meteorite. It was hard to get hold of doctors, customer service evaporated, they practically stopped responding. Keep far away from Gold. Rely on local doctor.",
            "Why you should not Use this app . Read completely . I have purchased the Gold membership for unlimited cobsultation. Though I just needed 1-2 consult per month. The app just never asssign me with a doctor. They play a fake game. Shows that the doctor is busy and I wait for 30mins . Then they transfer my appointment to another doctor. I wait 30 min more.Then they transfered me to another low quality doctor. I patiently waited for 30 minutes more. The doctors never called.This will happen to u.",
            "1st consult is very good , you will think that this app make your problem solved but after that they are very bad at service. I am a gold subscription member but I can't reach the doctor at times and when I talk with the doctor after his medication and tell about my problem then the doctor said to visit nearest doctor and after that he will tell the process. If I have to visit the nearest doctor then why I am using the docapp with that type of expenses I did??? Very poor experience at all.",
            "This is a fraud app, I have a 1 year plan in it, then he blocked me, because of which the app is not able to use it. They not replay on email, nor do any solutions from the customer care come out and i am going to login this app then its show otp invalid , do not take 1 year pack on this app. This is fraud .",
            "It was good for sometime. Now they are not 24/7 support especially when it comes to refund. I had great difficulty in booking lab tests twice. Now one of my payment is stuck and no refund yet."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",

It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos.

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",

        "comments": [
            "Most questions good but not too difficult. Two annoyances are: Mini games between levels. Why? They are irrelevant to trivia. The second annoyance is that some of the tiles you are required to play are not trivia, but are simply games of chance. \"Click the chest to get more coins!\" But if you guess wrong, you lose a life...lose too many lives and the game shuts you down. This is super lame.",
            "Very entertaining. Even learning some new things so makes it worth it. Love how you have control over how hard you want the levels to be. That way its not too easy or too hard. Because when there's no level in between i usually just delete the app. It's the perfect game for me before bedtime, its the only game i've found that relaxes me and calms my brain so i can rest and my brain actually shuts off because it's tired. So yes i give 5🌟s thank you for the upload. I'll be keeping this one.",
            "I freaking love it. A bit heavy on the ads but hey, it's free. You can at least watch an ad to get another life once you run out. I don't mind dropping a little $ once I've thoroughly researched an app. Runs smooth other than ads but it's great you're not immediately forced to pay for upgrades before really getting a chance to see if it's really an app for you. Very enjoyable!!",
            "Without doubt the best quiz app out there. I have had some problems with it freezing, I managed to get to level 540 and it would not go any further no matter what I did so I have had to start again from scratch. I've now managed over 100 levels and it's only crashed once so fingers crossed I'll keep my score and history without having to start again.",
            "As games go; this one is pretty good! You only have to watch ads when you get an answer wrong. I am on level 55. Each level has approximately 15+20 questions. You have little mini-games some times. If you win those you are asked if you want to double your score by watching an ad. When you answer a question, right or wrong, it gives an explanation to the question. So you can learn something. It is a little like the original board game of Trivia Pursuit. I think it's a good game."

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "I read tarot but don't always have the cards with me. The cards are accurate in their placement and as long as the person reading has their own context clues, the reading will be quite good. And the more I use this app, the more I appreciate all its features. Try out some of these different paths. I love the different spreads and will probably add some of then to what I do now. Even the ads are not intrusive. Very manageable. I am very grateful for this app.",
            "I love it. Fun, interesting & spot on with most of it. As it goes... \"Tarot never lies\". Its amazing how accurate these are. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose. Hope it works as well for others as it does me & people around me who try it from my phone. Mind blowing! Take what you read on the light side, not too serious. Its great.",
            "This app has so far been good. I don't have any problem using it every day 😅. Nevertheless, I would urge the creator to add one more special feature about moon & sun signs astrology😭, besides having the horoscope section. 😎😇 It will also better the app.",
            "That was actually spot on. I'm new to tarot but catching on quick. I have had paranormal experiences my entire life. Have seen 6 UFOs. Dreams I remember having, that give me deja vu, witch always have to do with future events in my life and are almost exactly the same. Plus I'm pretty good at predicting cards with shapes. Not sure what all that means and have been searching for answers my entire life. Tarot makes a lot of sense to me and so far it's been a positive tool in my life.",
            "First use was soooo accurate. I was able to connect with two friends spiritually and that's exactly what it read. Also, it said If I start a new business soon, I can accomplish it. Weirdd because I've been debating since last year and just these past few months about starting my own..."

Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there.

Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface.

Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art.

And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. <br><br>Also, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. <br><br>There you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.<br><br>Privacy Policy:<br>http://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",

You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "Meh. In the beginning it's great but now after 2 years it's completely stale. I've dropped enough money into the game to see it go no where. The rewards are lacking, the amount of time, energy and money you need to tier 3 characters is laughable. I'm tired of timeline battles and old story modes. Everything is just repeating... It's no longer fun. I will play once a day and then move on to better things and eventually just stop playing all together. Not dropping anymore more money into this.",
            "Been playing this game since 4 years now and these are the things that I've realized...they never listen to their player base; rewards against your hard work are just peanuts; used to be free to play friendly, but over a period of time, it has become more paywall friendly. No improvement in rewards but unnecessary changes in the game to grab your cash. So, if you wish to play this game coz of your beloved Marvel Characters, you need to be filthy rich. I used to support this game but no more.",
            "I have played this game for 5 years on different accounts. Never have I ever felt cheated before. But the new system introduced in the latest update has broke the game. If you pay, you win. Its that simple. The cost has increased exponentially (to the thousands) and as such I cannot recommend this game. I loved this game but its finished now. Find a better game to invest in.",
            "Playing this game is like collecting good looking models. That's it. Oh, a number of them, you need real cash to get them, and a few of those are not worth it gamewise. After years of playing, I find it not enjoyable anymore due to the cost it demands every update. I feel sorry for my investment to this game up until recently. If you, reader, want a Marvel game to play, this isn't the one. Hard pass.",
            "I've been playing for a long time but this latest update is horrible. Confusing and redundant systems being added that do not enhance the game but seem to be geared to force players to spend money. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a game LOOK ELSEWHERE. Even veteran players are boycotting this game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"

            "Best Way strategy game I would give it 5 stars, if not for this few things I wish the developer would add very soon 1. A way to vote out a clan leader: some leaders can't access their game accounts anymore. So they begin afresh, but resuming their leadership role becomes impossible, so they and clan members are force to abandoned clan cos of inactive leader. Please make it easier to change leaderships in clans to save clans 2. Please include clan battles and gold sharing. Thanks",
            "I like the game but if you could just buy the game and pay for updates i think i would spend money. The way its set up its like a never ending nickle and diming. And whoever pays gets more advantages which isnt really strategic so much as pay to win. Also, i feel like im playing a computer many times even when it says im playing wifth or against another person... i dont know. Also, it doesnt take much strategy for someone to sit in their base and develop a nuke (sPaCe StRiKe) and just blow U up",
            "Great game once you get to level 7 where skirmishes are avaliable this game is a real rts but its not for a casual player as game play is slow do you need time to invest. This is a pay to win and things are expensive but you can also invest time and get the things another (research) production queue would be great devs also but please don't miss out on this game its very good once you get into it. Thanks",
            "Game doesn't load after its open, I am done waiting and unsitalling it right now. I used to love this game a lot but now this issue has killed the vibe, i would appreciate the developer team to fix it as soon as possible. Really want to play it again Just because of this issue i have given it 1 star",
            "The game is good and the graphics also.. but for now i just give a 4 star.. i wish that you can fix a minor problem that i encounter like sometimes the troops dont know where to go when i ordered them.. they just walking to somewhere dead end area."

            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",

Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",

            "I like that it tells you if you have the wrong letter and if you get stuck you can ask for a letter. The questions are general knowledge. Another app had their puzzles according to different subjects so if you didn't know anything about that particular subject you were lost. The easy ones are hard enough for me but I like that you have a choice for people that might be more skilled in crosswords. (Smarter than I am!)",
            "Update: Some of the Clues & Answers seem to be aimed at the \"boomer\" generation and the C&A's are repeated often. It's still a great crossword game, It's a simple design, user friendly, it costs nothing to use hints. Which is great for anyone who wants to unwind. Not everyone knows who the star of \"touched by an angel\" is. And that's ok! You don't need to know. Use the hints that don't require you to watch ads, spend coins, wait (X amount) time or cost you money. Be free & relax 😊",
            "Used to be great, but now ads are too intrusive. Before, a simple silent ad would pop up and you could tap through it. Fairly low annoyance factor. Now, massive full-screen ads with obnoxiously loud audio FORCE you to watch videos for games you don't want. The frequency of the ads has increased too. The game is great otherwise, with a solid easy interface and good features. Used to be a lot of fun but I am sadly going to have to uninstall."

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Game itself is good, but customers service and support is total zero. T4f only need your money and that's all. You'll never get support from them if anything happens in the game. Someone hack my account that i spent goo few ££ on it and totally destroyed. I've got in touch with customer service straight after someone logged in from different device and asked for help so they block them, unfortunately they reply 3days later when everything was destroyed and told me \"sorry comma,we can't help you\"",
            "This is a great game. I am having issues that has been going on for a long time. It looks like they tried to resolve the issues but it still exist. I have 4 different profiles and for all four, any talent points I acquired, the game doesn't allow me to use them.",
            "Its hard to play game specially REFT of LEGEND, the events unbalance the player during matching. Other events is good, the concern is adjast the research time of all research so that weak can balance to the strongeist and so for the player spend money to become strong.",
            "I like the game. It's not hard to play. Also you don't need to get powerful. I've been playing for a few days and my ranking is number one. That's amazing.",

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "Game is fun, but its hard pay to play, even spend some money to buy better plane but that was enough only for 20 lvl's, and there is 200+ lvls, if u want to move after that its pay to play, really hard progress without spending alot of money, i get the devs needs to get paid, but this is too much, getting diamonds should be really increased or decreased the items that cost alot, as i c it now will never get pass lvl 50, so probabbly gonna give this game, and find simillar cheaper game",
            "The game is fun, until you realize it is not just difficult. It is stupid difficult. After you get to level 100. You will start figuring out that in order to move any further, you will need to start dropping some $$$ on the game to upgrade/obtain better aircrafts and weapons to defeat even easy levels. Fun for a while but just don't invest your time/money past level 100. But the hook is real and the developers knows it.",
            "This game went from pretty good to absolutely screwed up in one update, which it took 2 more updates to even get working. They reduced the power of everything, took all our devices we had earned or bought and deleted them and gave us credits for the new stuff, which wasn't close to worth the amount of work we put in to it. Stay clear of this game Another update and it still sucks. This has no gone from a free game to pay to play. AS IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS Stay clear of this app.",
            "In multi-player your opponents are allowed to use all their planes even though they have a far lower rank than you, Dumb AF! Then when I updated it stopped letting me collect the vip points. Used to be able to watch a video to collect up to 20 points a day, not now though. It still has vip points as part of the game, but now there is no way to earn them. Unless you pay. GAME USED TO BE GOOD befor they made it PAY TO PLAY!",
            "UPDATE: 10-23-2020. The developers got back in touch with me and release a update. The problem has been fixed!!! 4 stars! OLDER REVIEW; This game is fun and I would love to spend money on it. But it is glitchy with its' pop ups. And no I'm not talking about ads. I'm just talking about regular in game menus. For example; after I successfully complete a mission flawlessly. It will then give me the ability to watch a ad for extra coins. I do that, then I click continue. Once I'm back at the main screen, it then will pop up with, \"here is a special deal\" or \"congrats you went up a rank.\" But then it will permanently freeze the game. Even if I hit okay on this pop up, it just stays there with the sound of the game in the background playing and the green okay button recognizing that I'm hitting okay. However the menu stays up and I can't even back out of it. So I have to close the app using my phone instead and then re login back into the game. PLEASE FIX THIS!"

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",

I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

It's not even playable anymore and the only way to remove the obnoxious amount of ads is to get the subscription at $2.99/wk. Sadly 'Uninstall' is the best option.",
            "This used to be one of my favorite games. Now they have added a completely excessive amount of ads. After every guess, right or wrong, I get an add. THIS WHOLE GAME HAS JUST BECOME NON-STOP ADDS. I spend more time now watching adds then playing the game. It takes me 3 seconds to make my new guess and type it...but then I get a 45 second long add🤬🤬🤬🤬",
            "I have been playing this a lot lately, it's good fun and addictive. Some of the levels repeat (I just got exact same picture I've had before) but good variety overall. However the addition of ads popping up after guesses is really annoying. I could put up with it for hints or at the end of a level but it's really off-putting now. My other negative would be once you advance in the game you have to scroll all the way down every time. It would be nice to have a way to jump down to where you're at.",
            "An ad after every guess?! What the hell people? I've played this game for quiet a while and have always enjoyed it. Now I'm uninstalling it because that is obnoxious that you feel the need to flood people with ads after every guess. Right or wrong. Doesn't matter. Here's an ad. Oh whats that? Another one? You sure? Its only been one word, but okay. BAM!!!! ANOTHER AD!!!!",
            "Haven't played in a long time and decided to reinstall it. Mad at my self for doing it. There is an ad after each guess making it enjoyable like it use to be. Had to uninstall. Understand having ads but that was way to much."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option.

            "I love this app. The Read Aloud function alone is worth the 5 * rating. In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",
            "Just purchased an ebook. Money has been deducted from my account and the transaction is shown to be successful. Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "I'm using this app for 5 years specially for picture editing, it used to be the best. But your update sucks. Hope you'll bring back the old, productive and useful interface.",
            "I used to love it, now I hardly use it. Why fix something that's not broken. I don't like that they added unnecessary things to it. I enjoyed being able to put a natural filter, maybe edit out a blemish or two (which now I cannot seem to), and straighten my picture out. It was simple, easy to navigate and use. I don't mind the added filters because they're fun but the rest is too much. Leave the excessive retouching to Facetune, I don't need to make my face smaller, adjust the size of my lips, give myself a face lift, etc. Other have also mentioned the portrait mode, and fine adjustments that we could do back then like adjust separate colors, etc.",
            "This was the only photo editing tool I needed until the update. All I had to do to get a \"perfect\" picture, was go to the facial editing section, put the smoothness to around 40, save & go. Every photo came out looking flawless and still real! Never overdone. Now, if it doesn't recognize a face, you can't even use the facial editing tools. Even if you could, the \"smoothness\" option is gone anyway. I have no use for this app anymore. I don't even know what to download instead. So disappointing.",
            "Updated: This was far better before few updates. The filters were easy to access, there were multiple grain/particle effects in Adjust menu now there's only one; the overall user interface for photo editing was one of its kind before. So, this was my only favorite. Now it's more like other apps like Youcam and Picsart. Hope to see some old features back.",
            "This app is useless. Take one photo, leave it for a few seconds, try to take another photo an dot freezes. Have to click the X 15 damn times to close it and then reopen only to have it crash again. Does the same tying on my other other, does the same thing even after I wiped out the phone three times, does the same thing no matter if I change the storage path from device to chip. The ads are annoying even when I subscribed. The popups for filters are annoying, if I want it I will select it."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ❤",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

Ana Urruticoechea Arana, reumatóloga; y por el Dr. Fernando León Vázquez, médico de familia. Y en el comité editorial participan los doctores Iñigo Rúa-Figueroa, José Luis Andréu, Alejandro Olivé,  Mercedes Freire y Vicente Giner.\r\n\r\nEl objetivo principal del proyecto es desarrollar una guía de derivación que ayudará al médico de atención primaria en la toma de decisiones ante la sospecha clínica de una EAS, facilitando su reconocimiento y su derivación al reumatólogo en su caso.\r\n\r\nEl objetivos secundario es sensibilizar a los médicos de familia de la existencia de estas patologías menos frecuentes, mejorar la calidad de las derivaciones, disminuir los tiempos de espera y coordinar los dos niveles asistenciales en relación con estas patologías.\r\n\r\nPor su complejidad, la afectación multi-sistémica y baja frecuencia, el manejo de las enfermedades autoinmunes sistémicas es un formidable reto al que se enfrenta el médico en su práctica clínica. Su abordaje requiere aprendizaje específico durante el periodo formativo, experiencia y una puesta al día constante. Aunque estas patologías se consideran enfermedades poco frecuentes, en conjunto se pueden considerar no excepcionales. “De hecho, estas enfermedades afectan a cientos de miles de pacientes en España y el médico de atención primaria puede enfrentarse durante su ejercicio a múltiples casos, al menos, al inicio de la enfermedad y colaborar con los especialistas en su seguimiento. En este sentido, deberá por tanto aprender a reconocerlas y mejorar sus competencias básicas en el manejo de este grupo de procesos”\r\n\r\nRealizado por un grupo de expertos de las dos sociedades científicas: Sociedad Española de Medicina Familiar y Comunitaria (SEMFYC) y Sociedad Española de Reumatología (SER). Se ha diseñado un índice de síntomas y signos guía a partir de cada uno de los cuáles se ha desarrollado consensuadamente un algoritmo de toma de decisiones que conducen a una lista de posibles diagnósticos y una propuesta de derivación. Los panelistas  han seleccionado diferentes signos y síntomas sospechosos de EAS. Cada algoritmo lo ha realizado una pareja formada por un especialista de reumatología y otro de medicina familiar y comunitaria, pertenecientes a la SER y SEMFYC, respectivamente. \r\n\r\nSe han diseñado 22 algoritmos homogeneizados con síntomas y síndromes ordenados por órganos y aparatos:\r\n\r\n- Cutáneos: Exantema, fotosensibilidad, púrpura, eritema nodoso y livedo reticularis.\r\n\r\n- Mucosos: Aftas orales y genitales, sinusitis crónica, xerostomía y parotidomegalia.\r\n\r\n- Vasculares: Fenómeno de Raynaud, trombosis venosa recurrente e isquemia arterial.\r\n\r\n- Oculares: Uveítis, ojo seco y epiescleritis.\r\n\r\n- Neurológicos: Cefalea/arteritis de la temporal.\r\n\r\n- Abortos recurrentes.\r\n\r\n- Músculoesqueléticos: Artritis agudas, artritis crónicas, artromialgias y dolor crónico.\r\n\r\n- Síntomas generales: Pérdida de peso y fiebre.\r\n\r\n- Alteraciones analíticas: Reactantes de fase (VSG y PCR),  factor reumatoide, ANAs y la creatinfosfokinasa.\r\n\r\nLes presentamos la GUÍA DE DERIVACIÓN que se ha  desarrollado en una aplicación (App) que facilita su disponibilidad en un formato actual.

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

I'm not saying that this problem is on you guys end but, when it logs me out of an online match I lose money each time and can't get it back. I enter these online matches to get more virtual currency but when I'm getting logged out I can do that. So basically I'm losing money and can't gain it.",

            "this game cheats on every level. opponents miss basketball, they get major points still, game freezes @ pivotal shots let alone 60% of the time. when you hit a bank shoot, the opponent will be awarded the points, even if they miss. they still get the points. Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",

I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",

A really nice app and I recommend this for every student. If u feel like a lot of ads are disturbing you, you can just switch off the internet connection. Works with my phone, not sure if it works with yours.🤔",
            "I'm so happy that you add the feature that you can collect coin in every correct answer and buy another option. The app itself is great buttons are well made, no delay and no lag. Speaking of adds, i don't have problem with it. Speaking of 'tricks' I already mastered some of those and can actually solve mentally. Ps: I just used it for one day. How much more If i use this for so long? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. For developer of this app. I want you all to congratulate for this masterpiece. Gb",
            "1. When you finish a single game, the app shows you how to solve the problem, but it doesn't show what type of problem this solution works for, and instead of the title, the score appears. 2. You can add a solution to the square equation according to Vieta's theorem.",
            "It's an amazing app! It teaches you how to solve math questions in the simplest and easiest way and also tests you on what you have learnt. This is really an app I'll recommend if you want to improve your marks in mathematics and take it into a whole new level! The best part about it is that it is free! Hats off to the developer for creating this wonderful app. 😄😄😄",

It also contains many Maths problems, which help us to understand the tricks better. It contains Maths games and multiplication table. Thanks a lot to the app developer for developing this outstanding app."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

        "description": "This APP provides you with all the food you need to take to take care of your heart and to prevent heart diseases.\r\n\r\nt's the perfect opportunity to be more proactive about taking care of your heart. After all, it works hard - without breaks - to keep you alive, so you should do your part and return the favor.\r\n\r\nWhy else is it important to maintain a healthy heart as you age?\r\n\r\nTaking great care of your heart to avoid cardiovascular disease is critical, but that shouldn't be your only motivator. There are many other reasons to proactively maintain a healthy heart:\r\n\r\n1. To maintain cholesterol and blood pressure\r\nHigh cholesterol levels increase your risk for developing cardiovascular disease, but that's not all. Unhealthy cholesterol in the blood can also lead to heart attack and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure levels are even more threatening to your overall health.

To reduce feelings of depression\r\nDid you know that cardiovascular disease can increase your chance of feeling depressed?

To lower your risk of developing dementia\r\nThere's a connection between heart health and mental well-being, but it goes beyond feelings of depression. Research shows that poor heart health is also associated with dementia. When you don't properly take care of your heart - with smart lifestyle decisions - you're narrowing your blood vessels, which then limits the amount of blood that can get to the brain. Without proper blood flow, your brain can't work the way it's supposed to and you may have trouble making decisions, reasoning with others and remembering familiar faces and places.\r\n\r\n\"People often associate memory loss with Alzheimer's disease, and they think it can't be prevented or treated,\" said Ralph Sacco, M.D., chief of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami and former president of the American Heart Association. \"But controlling your risk factors for heart disease can make a difference in slowing its progression.\"\r\n\r\nHow can I take better care of my heart?\r\nBy making smarter lifestyle choices, you can protect your heart and reduce your risk for developing life-threatening conditions. Making these small decisions can have a large impact on the health of your heart and your overall well-being:\r\n\r\n    Follow a heart-healthy diet\r\n    By eating more nutritious foods and removing unhealthy fats from your diet, you can fuel a thriving heart, reduce your blood and cholesterol levels and maintain your weight, according to the Heart Foundation. Eat more fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, and limit your salt and alcohol intake.\r\n   \r\nDownload the application and learn about foods that prevent heart diseases and maintain a healthy heart.\r\n\r\nGood luck to all and hope the remedies in this application will help you keep a healthy heart \r\n\r\nConsider sharing  this application to family and friends, it would be a huge support to rate this App five star so that people can easily find it in the store.\r\n\r\nThank you for checking out this App!!",

            "Definitely NOT unlimited. From what I have read the app uses some algra rhythm to determine how many books you can listen to a month. Sometimes I am able to listen to 6, sometimes they cut me off at 4. Very frustrating. They even take the books away if you have downloaded them and make you wait until your next payment goes through. I wish they offered a truly unlimited option for the audio book portion..I would definitely pay more for truly unlimited access",
            "This monthly fee is so worth it....no late fees if you don't read the book fast enough, read without worrying about a due date, read on my phone (super convenient) and about 85% of the books I've searched for I've found (some were even books that people personally uploaded). Lately the app has been buggy. There's an option to categorize your book titles. I would like to eventually see all my titles moved only into that specific list.",
            "Can't say enough good things about this app. For $9.99 a month, I have access to at least 75% of the books I have searched for. (That estimate may be too low,) Some are audio books, some are ebooks. Sometimes I have access to both audio and ebook for the same title. Magazines, articles, and so much more. In the time of Covid, I was waiting 2-3 months for ebooks and audiobooks from my library and spending a fortune for ebooks from that site that starts with an A. SCRIBD IS GREAT.",
            "I am a big book nerd but I hate buying books online (no local bookstore) without getting to look through them. This app solves this issue! Most books I start on here, I end up buying a hard copy of. The subscription fee is totally reasonable especially since they offer lots of audiobooks. After looking into other apps, glad I pick this one.",
            "The app works great. I wish the service would just be upfront that there's a limit on non-librivox audiobooks. When they just throttle searching it makes it look like there catalog is inconsistent, and it's just generally a sneaky way to handle it. I'd much rather know the limit and budget it, just like it is with library based services."

            "Needs events or something to make power ups easier to get Some levels are damn near impossible without them and the gold is expensive af. ** love the game overall! Have been playing for a long time! I've made it past over 300 levels but this entire time it's kind of been a lackluster game compared to some of 'your' others",
            "Its always challenging to figure out how to defeat a level. The only levels I really dont enjoy are the ones where there are chains over the buckets and you have to hit a matching color \"face\" thing to open it and the \"face\" changes color and changes which bucket it opens.That one is too confusing trying to figure out the pattern without wasting pears to shoot.",
            "Simple and fun,but there are some REALLY hard levels that can take even days to beat,such a simple and long game shouldn't have such hard levels. There should be an option to skip levels for free if,for example,you fail to beat it in 10 - 15 lives or maybe even less.",
            "I click the little circle on the top right corner and it says to put my fb information and when I do , says invalid token access .. what does that mean? why can't I see which level my friends are on ? Please fix",
            "It's an entertaining and addictive game, but it has some major cons. You only get 5 lives and you have to wait a certain amount of time before they regenerate, even though this game is clearly designed to make you constantly fail and replay levels. 5 lives is not enough, a game like this shouldn't even be using the \"lives\" format, it just ruins the experience and makes me stop playing since I have no more lives. This game is all about luck, not skill, which is extremely annoying and lazy."

Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

        "description": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \r\n\r\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\r\n\r\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\r\n\r\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\r\n\r\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com.

Here is what’s new: <br><br> - Bug fixes and performance improvements<br> - exFAT support for compatible phones*<br> - Adding a connection to the Western Digital Store<br><br> As always, if you have any questions, please visit kb.sandisk.com.<br><br>* If your phone natively supports the exFAT file system and allows applications like ours to access it, then our app can support and detect your SanDisk exFAT devices.",

            "I transferred the entire contents of a uSD card to a larger capacity card using Memory Zone. Two things: 1. The file list should scroll as files are copied/moved so you can see where you are in the process. 2. Much more importantly, the timestamps on the copied/moved files *should be the same as the original files*. Having 200 gb of files with the current date and time is useless. I will now have to do the entire thing again using a different utility. The app is useless until this is corrected.",
            "My first attempt to copy a video worked, so went ahead and moved a bunch of pics using this app. All files are on the USB but are unable to open on any device stating \"unsupported file type\" and I can't find how to fix so my pics are lost. Awful experience, I'll be seeking a refund 👎👎👎",
            "I would not recommend this app at this time, because I can't use it. I have to: grant the SD card (which is SanDisk card) access to the SanDisk Memory Zone app in order to complete the operation. The directions that come with the app are incomplete at best. So far using this app has been a waste of time. I can't transfer anything at this point. I've tried contacting you once before & I'm still waiting for an answer or acknowledgment. The SD card I have on my phone now is the SanDisk Ultra Plus microSDXC UHS-I card with Adapter 64GB. The small card is the one I can use on my phone.",
            "I loooove the App.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't get my songs to play one after the other. If you could make that happen I would give 10 stars. Apart from that I love the App. Soooo glad I can edit and rename and move my music back and forth from folder to folder.",
            "One of the Best App in entire playstore. This app is extremely useful for your personal data Handling , Avoids Google drive file duplications shows your internal and external storages and also your cloud storages with proper details. Can move or copy data from one location to another very easily."

            "Very interesting to see the details of the air traffic passing nearby. Often very surprising where flights are going to or coming from. Even air traffic 30000 ft above you is covered! One can even track a particular flight around the world. Entertaining and informative. Weekly air news email included. Links to aircraft pictures. Great app, works very well.",
            "I paid for the former Flightradar24 Pro. The paid app was closed down without any warning expressed or otherwise. Former Pro license owners are forced to download the newer versioned app (renamed slightly) and pay again, this time a yearly subscription for most of the functionality already offered in the aforementioned Pro license. The 3 month free trial is an insult to injury and is of no value to me. I don't intend to do future business with this company.",
            "Sometimes it's glitchy and planes or helicopters will \"disappear\" then re appear further on it's course. This rarely happens but I noticed it quite a few times with the Chinooks. Sometimes they have the picture wrong or I've also seen helicopters show up as planes. Over all an awesome app but these are just a few things I've noticed.",
            "I enjoy using flight radar I got the gold membership since I'm always looking at the sky. I wish the AR would calibrate and not force close. My son likes to find a plane the look up the info. I hope it will be fixed soon. Otherwise it's great.",
            "Great app, could be better, but overall, a great app, I use it a fair bit. It should show a picture of the selected aircraft, even of one with a different tail number, most aircraft do show this but some don't."

I like that it uses the proper Latin terms too. I still use the app daily in massage to see muscle movement, and to search for a correct muscle name for soap notes. Thank you!",

Are you a teacher or lecturer looking to inspire your students? Are you curious about how the human body works? If so, then LoveNeuro is for you.\r\n \r\nLoveNeuro is an educational app designed by a student, for students. It runs across a variety of Android smartphones and tablets, with the aim of bringing the human nervous system to life for its users. This app contains a variety of useful resources to help you learn and remember the complex but amazing nervous system. Sections 1.0. – 4.0. are easy-to-understand notes and specially picked diagrams that explain the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, from the cellular level up to the gross anatomical level. Section 5.0. provides more than 90 interactive quiz questions to test your neuroscience knowledge.\r\n\r\nSection 6.0. introduces the Inking Zone - use a stylus or touch to annotate blank templates of the nervous system and then share the completed diagrams to your favourite cloud storage or note-taking apps for revision later. Section 7.0. offers four video tutorials (Alzheimer's disease, the HPA axis, spinal cord and the action potential). Section 8.0. contains The Neuroscience Dictionary and a recommended reading list.\r\n \r\nThroughout LoveNeuro you’ll find clinical, research and revision notes that help to put your knowledge in context.

Every other game is filled with players who stand still but you can't shoot them but they shoot you. This game is unplayable and the european staff responsible should be fired. Scum, just scum.",

To make things worse, I can't always find the article I was reading again. Annoying. Update...Still happening. Still annoyed.",
            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",
            "I've been using News break for about a year now, and it's been informative and accurate in relating the news. I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",
            "The developer needs to work on this site!!! They do not respond back, or even care about issues. It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

            "I love this app,it has beautiful filter and the camera looks good realistic and all BUT the reason I gave it four stars is there are not that many options I would love to have many options cause I love taking selfies and there are not that much filters,makeup,etc.So please add more filters so I could change it to five stars really appreciate your hard work on this app for the users I hope this app will be successful 😁",
            "I love the easy to use filters there are stick filters normal filters and even guides if you can't take a good selfie I use this app almost every day and I love it so much 😍🥰😍🥰",
            "pretty darn neat . I think what makes this app the greatest & sets it apart from the rest is the guidance feature. many of us draw blanks when you're about to take a photo and they all end up looking like the other 3000 you took days before. I think this is definitely the star feature that ranks this app at the top of my list. love the fact your preset changes are visible in the Video function--I'd say allow for us to record continuously w/o a couple minutes limit & this is the PERFECT APP. ♡"

Don’t get spooked - we need keen-eyed Detectives like you on the job!<br><br>VOLUME 4 CHAPTER 3 - &quot;Covert Operations&quot; is next up for you to tackle! The team works hard to bring you an exciting new chapter every week. Uncover a new mystery in June&#39;s Journey every Thursday.",
        "comments": [
            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like \"Download print issue\" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
            "I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
            "Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
            "App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
            "Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless."

            "Update: Kudos on the response, developers BUT I cannot change my rating. The adverts & rewards were many & selectable & I watched them but now, every couple of minutes a 5 second ad shows, then a popup ad, then another.... just spoils the game. I constantly viewed the ads to get the rewards but now it's just plain infuriatingly irritating. Still a great game but latest update bombards you with so many ads it completely spoils the gameplay and flow of the game. Sorry, I'm out.",
            "The best of its kind! Thank you for the support and fast response to your community. In the new arena mode how you can earn more points? What's the concept? First time got 22k high score and after that I can reach only 15k",
            "I actually like the game. It's a good shooter. My problem was that I bought gems didn't receive them. Contacted the developer twice and did get an acknowledgement let alone a response.. in the end had to seek a refund from Google. Thanks Google 👍 but shame on the developer 👎",
            "Retro vertical space shmup. If you're a fan, you might like this one. I'd recommend it as the ads haven't been oppressive and it's pretty straightforward.",
            "Love the game. It is way better and much less glitchier sluggish like some other one which I wouldnt recommend. One setting that they also remembered with these type of games with lots of flying and enemies and exploding etc, is the the one to give you a choice if you want to play with High, medium or low graphic settings. That gives you a 1 in 3 chance to play the game and not like others force you too and then its sluggish and glitchy. Well done devs. Great game."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

        "description": "The Apgar score was devised in 1952 by the eponymous Dr. Virginia Apgar as a simple and repeatable method to quickly and summarily assess the health of newborn children immediately after birth. Apgar was an anesthesiologist who developed the score in order to ascertain the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies.\r\n\r\nThe Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained.

        "descriptionHTML": "The Apgar score was devised in 1952 by the eponymous Dr. Virginia Apgar as a simple and repeatable method to quickly and summarily assess the health of newborn children immediately after birth. Apgar was an anesthesiologist who developed the score in order to ascertain the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies.<br><br>The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration).<br><br>Interpretation of scores:<br><br>The test is generally done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low.

It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process.  The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.\r\n\r\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of; \r\n1 x brain training session \r\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions \r\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual) \r\n1 x safe place exercise \r\nProgress Log function with prompts\r\nPowerful Bls brain visual simulating brain activity associated with anxiety reduction\r\n\r\nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and the general public.  However, persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision.\r\n\r\nThis app has been tested on Galaxy tab 2, Galaxy S4, and Google Nexus 7.",

            "This is an amazing app for use during virtual therapy sessions with a therapist! ... This app allows me to continue to use EMDR in my therapy sessions, during virtual sessions from home, due to the pandemic. ... I really enjoy the self-led functions for practice and reinforcement of anxiety-relieving behaviors, even when I am not overly stressed, as regular practice ingrains the behaviors so they become automatic in times of duress. ... I was quite relieved at the clear avoidance of faith/ideals or other topics besides simply healing from anxiety, in the sessions. Many other relaxation/calming apps speak of specific body parts (anxiety for an amputee), use religious wording (a trigger for those abused by \"the faithful\"), or visualization guidance that may contain phobias.This was what led me to believe that there were careful, thoughtful, conscientious mental health professionals involved in the creation of this healing tool. ... I told my therapist about this after I evaluated it's functions, and he is very excited to review it himself from a more clinical standpoint, with the intention of possibly suggesting it to his other virtual patients! ... To suggest an improvement; I would like to see a stereoscopic add-on for this app, as it would allow for distraction-free immersive VR functionality with even the most basic of headsets such as Google Cardboard, a huge boon for those of us with high distractability. I would accept this add-on as a micro-transaction within the app. I would suggest another improvement as well, buy my ideas have tangible value. ...

            "Amazing app but please, please, get rid of or at least lower that guitar that comes on at the end of each session. I end each session feeling amazing then that guitar jarringly blares in my ear and undoes the relaxation. Begging the devs to edit the audio and remove or dramatically lower the guitar, I'd give 5 stars",
            "Wow! What an amazing app and process. For those of us without reasonable access to EMDR therapists, this app is perfect. Even the guided meditations alone are the best I've come across. I hope to see some more added later. I was 100% ready to mess with this app for about 5 minutes and then hit Refund. After giving it ago, hell i would pay way more for this level of content and the result I get! Thank you a million times for this hidden gem!",
            "Skeptical Until I Tried It... This app has helped me get over panic attacks (and anxiety attacks) in the moment they begin. It takes practice and patience but it worked for me. The guided eye movements with noise ear to ear....I know it's science...but I couldn't believe the state I was in after 5-10 minutes. This may be for you and it may not. We're all different, but as it's free, it's worth a shot. The first time I used this I was anxiety riddled on a plane and it got me through.",

Second issue: as I reviewed the details on the videos and then a group of photos, I noticed that the Time stamp was wrong on every single one of them. I reviewed the Date & Time setting on the phone itself and it is set correctly yet photos I know were taken in the morning are timestamped hours later. Nothing online to fix it.",
            "Wow! I've never seen an app get this much negative feedback! I took a few minutes and read several comments and it's quite clear this app is broken. The cameras in these Moto E5's do work but you will need to download a working camera app because once again this app is broken!!! It took me only a couple of minutes to figure it out I wonder what's up with the clowns at Motorola! I'm not a cell phone or software expert I'm just a guy who can read and understands what he has read. Fix your app Moto",
            "App gives camera error every time and does not save photos any longer. UPDATE: Found that having a 64GB micro SD card formatted as internal storage was what was causing the problem. Switched to 32GB and now use it as external and app works. (had been working for nearly three years the other way) Must have been an update to the phone when I wasn't looking. Maybe the E4 was just too good for the price they charged and they had to downgrade the phone. Upgrading review to five stars.",
            "Worked fine for many years. New update makes the app unstable. Frequently crashes on start. Randomly crashes during use. I suppose this is modern software for ya. Fix what ain't broke. Changes nobody asked for including UI - consistency out the window. Push things out the door as fast and cheap as possible - quality out the window. Updates that make an already trivial program require even more fantastically powerful devices to run... Your streaming pixel data to blit to the screen... Come-on!!!"

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "Used to be a brilliant game and loved playing. However within the past week app constantly crashes, especially when trying to use Boosters. Thinking it was an issue with my phone I uninstalled and reinstalled apps, lost all my boosters, silver coins etc the only thing that saved was the level I was at. Instead of being a relaxing game it's now really frustrating to play.",
            "It's a fun game but you have to admit you cheat. How do I get all but 1 pet off the board and you don't drop pets or the color blocks. If my booster is able to be used you cannot bc it kicks you out of the game. Why do you have us fill the piggy bank and then want us to pay for get the gold bars? They should be free. Why is there no way to win tickets to the circus? This game needs to be tweaked a lil bit and the cheating should stop. Just my opinion though.",
            "This game is becoming a total nightmare for a lot of its Players... it has gone cheat crazy ! I have played it on several devices since 2013.. at first the game was fun & enjoyable...how ever over the past 18 months..it has Had sooooo! Many flaws...cheats...unresponsive ! constantly lags. If you notify the team.. u simply get A very automated! Sorry & ur told to sign in & out of Facebook. .this will solve the issues... well it dose NOT! Solve the constant issues & nor dose it help. 😡",
            "This my favorite game but I have to start over I just wish there's was a way to get back to place I was at this is so easy but I was in the hardest part it helps your mine stay focused and you don't think about nothing because you will want to come back to this game",
            "Updated and glitches all over. If you play a previous level in another section, when you finish and don't check \"Next\", it takes you back to your current level. FRUSTRATING"

It's not everyday that we get free time during a certain hour. Say I've watched the first ad at 4pm today since I have a free time.

Until then, I can only give one star.",

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

            "I have never quit a game the same day i started it, until now. And odds are more money is made by the ads than the players. I was excited when i started playing too many bugs and bad choices by the devs or management however.",
            "Predatory gambling and political ads ruin what could have been a fun experience. Edit - Cookie cutter reply from Devs fails to address my concerns. Gameplay is good, predatory ads for malware or gambling are not.",
            "Beginnings are fun, but later it's unplayable for free users. Too many ads, repetitive, unjust, unfair. At some point, progressing is limited to paying customers, upgrading your ships above certain levels is available only after buying crystals or cards. You don't receive enough of them during normal game. Ads can break the sound in the game, and pause your music. Free users are limited to 20 games at a time. Then you need to wait for energy to replenish.",
            "I updated the app to this latest version and lost all my ship and drone upgrades!!! That sucked biiiiiiiig time and deserved 1/5. 🌟 But the compensation received in the in-app mail was more than enough and deserves a 5-star rating...have your 5/5 🌟 as a sign of gratitude from yours truly."

            "I LOVE THIS APP. I've had it for about 2 years now and it works perfectly. The updates are working and I don't experience any glitches and problems. All my favourite books are written on the app and getting to know the writers and the rest of the Wattpaders is really awesome and fun. I can write my chapters properly, only problem is, I'm worried it does not save or publish properly as it gives me false information and can be confusing. But nonetheless, great reading app!! Highly recommended.",
            "Helloooo. I'm writing this to say that I like the previous version of wattpad. When I open the app, it doesn't take long for the stories to appear. Now, I still need to open the internet to see my library which is a bit of a hassle. If I may recommend, please return the previous versions. The one without the need to download offline stories, because seriously, I don't like the update. I've been on wattpad since 2011 and so far, this is the worse update for me.",
            "The app itself is good but lately, i have been experiencing a lot of events such as one time I was writing a story that was worth about 600+ words but then a warning popped up saying \"wattpad has suddenly stopped\" which as you may know, all of the things i written wasn't saved. It broke my heart because I've been wanting to finish i but I have to restart and write it again. I hope that you can fix this. If so maybe the problem is my device.",
            "I'm using wattpad since 2014. Every year I saw how it changed. I'm missing the old wattpad when there is no Ads (every chapter), you can read different stories without paying for it, and you can add many stories in your library. Idk, what are the creators are thinking, lol. I just hope that the next update will get more better (lessen the ads and remove the limit of stories you can add in your library for offline reading)",
            "I totally want the Old Wattpad back. Everything is far different of what I used to love about this app. I've been using this app for almost 10 years and I know that the creator wants to improve it and earned money from it but this is too much. I have been experiencing some moments when I can't read because I need to connect to Internet but I'm already connected and that confuse me..."

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",
            "Was great at first. Now after 3 days of using it the notifcation have stopped. Ive when into app notifaction menu and set to urgent high priority and still nothing. I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",
            "The app will not load all my cameras and it's so glitchy. Great cameras and monitor but what's the point of having a app if you can't use it!! Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",
            "All of a sudden, getting no push notifications. When I try to check alerts, I get a message that says \"Failed to get alarm message\". I've checked the settings on my phone to make sure I can get the notifications and every thing is fine. Is this an update issue? Very irritating!"

For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",

            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update.

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",
            "It was so helpful for like me, who has a hobby of doing poems. I really enjoyed searching different words to fit to a certain topic of my work. So far there is no any trouble."

Love this app 😻",

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

In that category all of the spoken translations are messed up and 1 off (so it is translating for the phrase before it). Otherwise would have given 5 stars.",

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Amasing.., just amazing. It is a great game with awesome music, and I have minor complaints that are just me, and don't really effect the gameplay. 1. Press start last coin is a pain 2.nock em, is way to hard to be a hard rating. 3. Power trip backwards wave is a little bit tricky, (I love it though.) 4. It is a lttle bit add-heavy. (But that is how you make money so...) and 5. Power trip 75% is annoying. Over all, this is just me being nitpicky, great game. Good job robtop! Eddit: (2.2 when?)",
            "This game is really Awesome! The Music, Effects, and more! My favorite level is Press Start, all people like press start because its has a really cool music. But the part that i hate in Press Start is the Last coin and that makes me hate the game :D Big thank you to the creators for creating this game! It cheers me up sometimes :)",
            "This game is epic. Most of the 1 star reviews are people complaining on how it's so hard, how their device isn't the problem: the game is, and how it's so messed. But in reality, they just need practise, their device is the problem and the reason it had lost of ads is because this is one of the free games in the franchise kept up by ads. I love this game and hate it when noobs say how terrible it is when all they nerd to do is practice. If at first you don't succeed, try try again.",
            "This game is soooooooooo fun and I'm not even joking. All of the levels are so hard but fun, all of the 1 star people are just noobs who aren't good at the game so they blame it on dumb reasons like oh when I press this it doesn't work, and stuff like that but in my opinion this game is really good and I'm enjoying it and I hope u do to",
            "This game is sooo cool!!I just love the way the intensity of the music builds. And the PRESS START.....the level starts calmly....and then...... BOOM! It becomes so intense!! Especially when the PRESS START suddenly pops up i get so excited! I love it. This used to be DanTDM's intro so its gotta be great. No wonder why Dan played this game so much. Every single geometry dash game is awesome. Thank you to the games' creaters who are so genius.Thank you so much!"

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

Now, if users want to circumvent such automatic saving, you added the options \"Add to another...\", \"Move from...\" and \"Remove from...\" --- problem with that is that these options COULD ALL BE TRIVIALIZED if the previous system was still in place.",
            "After using wikipedia app for about 2 years, I've been encountered some problem,first when you want to read the article that has been saved,sometimes it doesn't load at all,and tell me that i do not connected to the internet even though i already downloaded it,two when it successfully load the page there are some photos that's not loaded,so i don't really know the context of the description of the pictures",
            "Love this app, love wikipedia. Far better than searching Wikipedia articles in a browser on mobile. It's easy to use and the in-page seach function is particularly useful, as well as the quick introduction pieces you would normally only be able to access by hovering over a link on a PC or laptop. The quick edits are pretty good, if I'm bored I might steamroller through a couple of image captions or article descriptions. I also enjoy reading the main page in the morning.",

The 'loading' animation is endless, and the first paragraph or more is missing. Also, it's now hard to get to History.",

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
            "Some of the fonts in other apps have change to outline after using this spp. I like help but not unnecessary changes. It is hard to read outline words. Hope you can look into this matter. Will things be back to normal should I uninstall this app.",

I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

I appreciate the quick response and look forward to the next update, so I changed my review from 1 star to 3 stars for now. The crash message appears every few minutes which is beyond annoying. I didn't want to uninstall app for fear I'd forget to reinstall it, as I have a large number of apps on my phone, but I may have to.",

            "Usefull app for travel. It is a database where other users can add known wifi passwords from home networks, shops, cafés,... This means during travel it is no longer needed to go drink or eat somewhere just to get the wifi password. It looks like you need a premium account to open it, it is not the case. Just click unlock password, manage through the ads and find the wifi password. The ones that I have unlocked and used, were always working. Can't complain for a free app and free wifi ;) I'll take some ads with that.",

I like the auto-fill in feature so that you do not have to type the whole word, but can choose from its suggestions. I particularly like the analyser feature where you can review what words you have looked up, so this is a further aid to learning new words. Not only is a translation for an English or Spanish word give, but there are examples of the word in context. Finally, the layout is particularly pleasant and easy to read.",

            "I'd give this game a 4/5 because it has extremely good graphics for a mobile game right now! The gameplay is awesome i'd just like to suggest some changes like- 1) Can it be made easier to collect fragments of missiles and Planes, instead of paying huge amount of money? 2) Earning gold should be made easier. 3) The keys to unlock special cases should be given whenever you play a great TDM with good amount of kills.",
            "Amazing game. Probably the best simulator i've ever played. Congratulations to dev team. For those who are quick reactions it is really excellent. Graphics, discovering little by little the game and new features happening. 5 stars without any hesitations. I don't know if VR can be used as i play on android. If it does, we are teleported on 22th century for air fighter games.",
            "This is the Best Game Ever.But I want to give some suggestions. Plz add more fighter planes like HAL AMCA, F-111, F-4, X-15, etc..And plz make the guns manual as they are automatic.I want u to add some more weapons like rockets, nuclear weapons, Rail Guns, Drop Bombs for ground targets, etc... In the Game we can add only 1 weapon in our ship with a gun. But I want a option where we can add more types of weapons . I want u to add more enemies like ground bases which shootout some SAM missiles..",
            "This game is awesome!! I've been playing a long while now so far no issues, the only thing that I request in the next update that you make an option to make for players to make a custom camouflage. And I appreciate the new missiles and fighters that was added to the game its just awsome!!!!!",
            "This game is a must play.It has an assortment of upgradable jet's that are completely bad arse! You don't have to pay to win.you simply need to imagine that you are in the cockpit of any one of these whips and rack up flight time for great scores.a person is able to fly under easy controls.also fly out of control if you upgrade to fast without getting used to the instant difference with each upgrade. Flying has never felt so real until modern airplanes made it possible. you like flying? Prove it"

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

The last time you gutpys updated two of my cameras stopped working on the app. but after two weeks or so they started working again. But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",
            "Poor experience in fast forward condition first you need to buy package than you can allow to use fast forward and that also not that great which you paid for cloud package Please put fast forward specifications in SD card also because without this specification no use to find person as soon as possible..... Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

        "description": "The largest nerve in the body is the sciatic nerve, and it is prone to sensitive changes which can cause excruciating pain which travels from the foot to the base of the spine. The condition in which the sciatic nerve cause this type of pain is called sciatica. Someone who experiences sciatic pain will find that the pain is centralized mainly in the hip area.\r\n\r\nThe sciatic nerve can become inflamed by simple things, such as pressure against it caused by wallets in your back pocket or wearing a belt too tightly. It is possible to correct these minor problems through various exercise, but only if you are under direct supervision of a therapist.\r\n\r\nStudies have concluded that sciatica sufferers can eat bananas or potato skins to alleviate the problem due to the amounts of potassium contained in them. Also, potassium supplements and multivitamins can also be recommended to help stave off incidents of sciatica in those who suffer from it.\r\n\r\nHydrotherapy is also a possible treatment for sciatic nerve pain. Taking hot soaking baths has been shown to give some relief to sciatica conditions. In this case, you would soak your body in water that is the same temperature as your body for about 20-30 minutes. After this, you would take a hot shower as you normally would do.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that therapeutic massage can aid in providing relief for sciatica; it is also said to prevent any flare-ups that could occur. Naturally, it is advised that you call a therapist to get the best plan of action for your particular condition. Generally, after a therapist will massage the painful area, it will then be soothed by rubbing the effected area with an ice cube or a lukewarm, damp rag.\r\n\r\nIt is important not to strain areas of the sciatic nerve through conventional exercises. Pregnant women should also be careful not to exert excess pressure on sciatic nerve areas. In both instances if care is not taken, the sciatic nerve will begin to swell and stimulate pain, leading into the hips.\r\n\r\nReflexology can theoretically help sciatica. Reflexology helps you to find certain reflex areas of the body in the shoulders and around the sciatic nerve. Your therapist would be the best help to find these points of reflex.",

It has no flash setting, or allow photos to be stored on the SD card. The absolute worst camera app I've ever seen. The latest update requires addtl permissions.Why does this app need my activity history???",
            "After years of testing - THE best camera for Moto X Play. Is it great? No! Far from it. But no other app acquires and maintains focus as well as this one. Moto X Play does not support manual/advanced camera controls, no matter what app you install. \"Moded\" or not. It's because it doesn't support Camera2 API. I've tested OpejCamera, Proshot, the newer Motorola Camera (com.motorola.cameraone), you name it... Cons: No ability to select storage for photos. I should give one star for this!",
            "Not user-friendly. Can't take a quick photo. For all the options (except exposure/contrast), you have to carefully swipe from left to right, and then an arch appears which again has to be rotated like a wheel to choose your desired option and then make a change. It's the same for Flash too -Auto/On/Off (Come On guys! At least you should be able to access the flash option quickly. You have to make 3-4 moves for this: \"Swipe, rotate if needed, Choose, & Click\" to change flash. Why can't it be changed by doing a simple tap on the flash indicator on the top left corner of the screen. Even WhatsApp Cam has that!!). To access recently clicked photo, you have to swipe again (from right). Recent updates have made the app much better - like being able to access, edit & share the recent photos.",

        "description": "Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness.\r\n\r\nAnyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages.\r\n\r\nSeizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis.\r\n\r\nTreatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age",
