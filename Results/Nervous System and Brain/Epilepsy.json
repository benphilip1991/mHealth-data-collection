This app can serve as a valuable communication aid,  by allowing you to generate a straightforward and professional report which can be shared with your physicians.\r\n\r\nIn general, we hope that this App will allow you to: \r\n\r\n1) track epilepsy trends and patterns over time\r\n2) objectively determine effectiveness of your epilepsy treatments \r\n3) improve success of doctors appointments\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which affects 1 in 26 people worldwide.  It can have a relapsing, remitting, and unpredictable course.  Treatment of epilepsy can be frustrating, and has been accurately referred to as being similar to the popular “whack a mole” game.  Whether your epilepsy is mild or severe, refractory or controlled, it is critical to objectively and consistently monitor certain factors such as number of seizures, seizure triggers, AED drug or ketone levels, and other vital information.    Keeping a detailed epilepsy journal will allow you to quickly notice any changes to your epilepsy, as well as provide you with impartial evidence as to whether your epilepsy treatment is truly effective or losing effectiveness over time.  \r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\n- Easy to use\r\n- Record seizure details (as much or as little as you like)\r\n- Visual representation of data \r\n- Generate reports\r\n- Keep track of medications with reminders\r\n- Customizable to fit your individual epilepsy\r\n- Full version completely FREE with NO ADVERTISEMENTS\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur Story/ Mission:\r\n\r\nOur daughter Olivia is our inspiration for this app.  Olivia has a refractory and severe epilepsy which began at age 1.

Although the journal was helpful in allowing us to objectively monitor the effectiveness of her epilepsy treatments, it was very time consuming and tended to be disorganized; As well, the hundreds of pages of notes did not help us when it became most critical to quickly and accurately summarize months worth of seizure history,  (for example during emergency  hospital  visits or follow up appointments).  During our experience navigating the neurology health care system, we found accurate and effective communication to be a key factor in successfully working with doctors and achieving ideal seizure control.   \r\nWe created this app as a free and simple way to monitor your epilepsy; track trends and patterns, objectively determine effectiveness of seizure treatment overtime, and improve success of doctors appointments.\r\nSince epilepsy contains dozens of ever changing variables, we decided to organize data into simple visuals which demonstrate seizure trends and patterns over a time span of months to years.  \r\nOur epilepsy journal allows you to quickly document all the important variables concerning your epilepsy, and to generate a simple and easy to read report to print out or email your doctors.  \r\nWe hope that this app enables you to grasp a better understanding of your own individual epilepsy, and that it empowers you as an effective communicator and advocate within your epilepsy health care team.",

Time them, add notes and to keep track of exactly what was happening at the time. I am able to select information to print of a journal of the months activity as well as graphs and trends. In 5 months I have logged 540 seizures. Great app.",
            "I like this app, parent of a child with epilepsy. The only aspect that disappoints me is there is no journal/notepad that I can see. My daughter will complain of a headache or something, and since we were just diagnosed a couple weeks ago I need something that might help me identify triggers or to record side effects of the meds. So as of now I have to use two apps and I wish there was a way to keep it in one place.",
            "Amazing for someone who has complex multiples seizures and multiple triggers. Thank you so much for developing it; it is well thought and gives tons of options to personalize it. It is a free app, but the developers deserve a donation for sure! It's a great time saver to help me monitor my son's severe epilepsy.",
            "This had been the most useful app for logging my seizures that I've found. There are so many options to make sure you have as much accurate information to send to your doctor as possible. I do wish there was an option to add a trigger instead of just selecting \"other\". But that's my only complaint",
            "I first used this app today & it perfectly recorded a seizure I had for 30 minutes and 26 seconds. This is a life saving app that I highly recommend & I've had seizures for over 30 years."

Helpilepsy is your personal health assistant to help you track & share your epilepsy more easily and more effectively. \r\n\r\nHelpilepsy is designed with leading neurologists/epileptologists and people with epilepsy.\r\n\r\nIt is your personal assistant to better track your epilepsy, with its complete & user-friendly diary, to better understand your epilepsy, with personal summaries & relevant articles, to better manage your epilepsy, with useful reminders & tips.\r\nIt is also your assistant during your consultations with your neurologist, thanks to a structured, interactive and actionable web dashboard (this dashboard is only available for pro users), to visualize the efficacy of your treatment.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or issues, feel free to contact us via support@helpilepsy.com !\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nBetween appointments\r\n • Track your epilepsy\r\nThanks to the diary, you can log your seizures seamlessly. You can also log your side effects, your appointments and any other epilepsy-related event. This will allow the assistant to help you with your epilepsy.\r\nIn the future, data about your epilepsy will even be recorded automatically, thanks to connected devices (e.g. the Apple Watch).\r\n • Understand your epilepsy\r\nHelpilepsy is more than just a diary. It helps you understand your epilepsy, thanks to personalized summaries and relevant articles. You will learn about epilepsy, so that you can better manage yours. Measuring is knowing.\r\n • Manage your epilepsy\r\nhelpilepsy aims to help you better manage your epilepsy, from medication reminders to personalized tips.\r\n\r\nDuring appointments (pro version only)\r\n • Visualize your epilepsy & the treatment efficacy with your neurologist\r\nThe Helpilepsy web dashboard allows your neurologist and yourself to have a structured, interactive and actionable view of your epilepsy. This allows your appointments to be focused on the future instead of the past of your epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\nIs Helpilepsy free?\r\nYes, Helpilepsy is free for all patients. We don't want to deprive anybody of a tool as essential as this. However, we still need to be sustainable, that's why there is a pro version, accessible only through our partner neurologists, which gives access to more features like the web dashboard for consultations.\r\nWant more info? Send us a mail at support@helpilepsy.com!\r\n\r\nWho are you, why do you do this?\r\nWe are a Belgian team, personally impacted by epilepsy. \r\nChronic diseases, like epilepsy, are tough. Unlike temporary diseases, they don’t just need to be treated (because current technologies don’t allow complete healing). They also need to be understood and managed.\r\nThat's why we're here: we want to help people with epilepsy, and their neurologists, better track, understand & manage the epilepsy.\r\n\r\nIs my data safe with you?\r\nWe use the best standards in encrypted communication protocols, so that your data is always safely handled. Want more info? Contact us at support@helpilepsy.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR COMMITMENT TO QUALITY\r\nThe Epione Application Helpilepsy is part of the Epione Platform, a class I medical software (under EU/MDD regulation) consisting of an Epione Application and Epione Dashboard intended for patients and healthcare professionals to monitor the patients’ chronic neurological disorders. The Epione Application Helpilepsy and the Epione Dashboard are specifically intended for patients and healthcare professionals to monitor the patients’ epilepsy.\r\n\r\nNote: this medical device is no substitution for normal care or practice.

My neurologist says they are different than some he's heard of by the time I could get to my clock on my phone and get to the timer portion of it my seizure would be over. Otherwise so far I think I'm going to like this app. :)",

I have simple partial seizures, and using this actually made my seizures worse because the interface was so difficult to manage. Original Review: I wish there was a widget so I could do a quick timer that I start either from the lock screen or the home screen. That would bump it up to a 4. Having a better interface on both the website and the app would bump it to a 5; all the features are wonderful.",

I have a bit of warning with my seizures so this feature is useful. It would be cool if I could put multiple triggers or multiple things that happened after the seizure episode instead of having to write the extras in my notes.",

            "This app is exceptional and perfect for documenting info pertaining to a seizure. I have tried several apps after my wife started having seizures and truly love this one. Its very simple to use. My only suggestion would be to allow you to ad/ edit the lists in the Preictal and Postictal sections. Thats one of two reasons that I did not give it 5 stars. The other is the fact that I just started using it today and want to use it for a while and make sure that I can easily send the info to the dr.",
            "It is a simple app. One thing I will really like to see improvement is, when we click on the + sign to add a seizure, it starts recording right away. It is frustrating & redundant additional step to click \"start recording\" when a seizure is happening. Quite frustrating for me. Delete of wrong record is easy even if we accidentally record one episode wrongly. So this feature to start recording when + is click should be updated.",

            "Your openseizuredetector is amazing for people with seizure history. I am doing research on tonic clonic seizure detectors. Garmin has gyroscope, accelerometer sensors while Embrace2 also has sensors for electrodermal and temperature. openseizuredetector app doesn't run on Embrace2 which has high false alarm and unreliable Bluetooth connection What's your suggestion about tonic clonic seizure detectors Embrace2 with fee or  Garmin/Pebble (which model runs better) with this app or other ? Thanks",
            "Amazing app. We use it with Garmin forerunner 735 for my 2 year old son for sleeping who has a severe form of epilepsy. It has quite literally saved my sleep. The heart rate limits are fantastic. It gives great piece of mind as I know the app will alert us if Cillian needs us during the night.",

Any false alerts it sensed you couldn't double tap the watch and hold to stop it 90% of the time, have to use the phone almost always to cancel the false alert. Tapping it to look at the time is a surprise if it does work. I bought a new phone, and now I cannot get it to connect via Bluetooth no matter what I do. I followed all the steps the support page said to do and it doesn't work. Wasted my money on this watch. I'd rather go to the ER. Wasted money."

            "I love this app and have used various iterations of it since 2007 on a blackberry.  It is a wonderful tool that helps manage not only my seizures, but also my Depression, Prescription record, major medical incidents, and pill reminders.  It has made tracking my episodes much much easier and even easier to report to my clinician as she can log right in and see it.    Now with the sleep record, I can also manage my CPAP log and see how the sleep effects the seizures and migraines better.  All I need now is an easy way to enter my blood pressure, pulse and pulse ox, and I will have all of my issues managed in one place.    Awesome work guys!  Keep it up and I will continue to advertise you all to my friends needing to monitor this stuff."

            "Nice app. Have used it for years now. Needed some as I have many heart issues. The only problem I have found is that responses list for organ donor. I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",

I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

It is a fairly common disorder affecting up to 3 million Americans. However, many people still don’t know what epilepsy is or how to treat people with epilepsy. The major symptom of epilepsy is a seizure, and this is such a scary experience for both the afflicted person and the people around them, that the many people have trouble coping. For people affected by this disease, this ignorance can magnify the fear and emotional stress that they already\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nSo, what is epilepsy? Basically, epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes seizures. Seizures are periods of abnormal behavior, when the person with epilepsy is not him- or herself. They are caused by abnormal electrical activity inside the person’s brain.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy usually has no permanent effects whatsoever on the person’s mental capacity. Despite the popular image of an epileptic person thrashing around on the floor and foaming at the mouth, seizures can take many different forms. For example, sometimes the person may not move at all, and seem to go into a brief trance from which they cannot be roused. Anyone who has two or more seizures that are not caused by a separate physical disorder may be diagnosed with epilepsy.\r\n\r\nFor someone who has just received a diagnosis of epilepsy, the news can be devastating. Seizures can be terrifying events - it is never pleasant to lose your sense of yourself and your self-control. However, even though epilepsy is a chronic condition, it is not necessarily a disabling one. There are ways to manage it and decrease the possibility of having a seizure. For some people, the seizures will eventually stop, even to the point where treatment is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nThis book will help you understand what epilepsy is, what causes it, and the different treatment options available for you. Once you understand the disease more fully, you will realize that the diagnosis of epilepsy does not have to keep you prisoner.

Here we could download an Android app that shows the position of EEG 10-20 electrodes in relation to 7 standard functional connectivity networks.<br><br>iBraiNEEG (intrinsic Brain Networks and EEG electrodes) application: The user view a 3D transparent brain with 7 standard functional connectivity networks and EEG 10-20 electrodes as red spheres over the brain. The user could rotate the brain using onscreen controls, and by tapping each electrode, the name of it appears on screen. By tapping the three points at the left side of the screen, the name of each functional network will appear.<br><br>iBraiNEEG is an application tool that helps to analyze EEG data in relation to functional connectivity networks.<br><br>Ref: G.M Rojas, J.A.

Flashes the screen white and black if it cannot use the flash.  Never be caught at a rave without it!\r\n\r\nHow many times have you been at a party when it's getting late, people are getting tired, and things are starting to die down?  Have you ever sat at home and yearned for the days of disco to return?  Have you ever wanted to give yourself a seizure to get out of class (please don't)?  If you answered Yes to any of those, then a strobe light can fit the bill.  Use strobe light at parties, at home, at the club, at school, or anywhere you think a strobe light could set the mood.\r\n\r\nPicture this.  You are having a party at your house.  The cute girl from your biology class is there.  Suddenly your bro says 'Hey let's turn this into a rave!'  Biology girl is feeling it.  But sadly, you don't have a strobe light!  Your guests leave in disgust and you are mocked for the rest of the school year. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to end that way.  With Strobe Light app, simply turn on the switch, place your phone on the table, and let the party begin.  Mileage may vary by phone type and flash brightness.  Should generally be bright enough to host a rave for 15-20 people.  \r\n\r\nTip: When you press the music button, you will get a hip techno music beat to liven the mood, but you can also listen to your own tracks stored on your SD card.  While the music is playing, simply tap on the song name (it will say techno) and it will pick music from your sd card!  Supports mp3 and ogg music formats (I haven't tried any others).\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments with suggestions on how to make the app better.

This Is either a bad app or faulty embrace2. I'm not paying a subscription after my trial if this not fixed, I need all its features, not just some of them. It's a very expensive product to be left broken.",
            "This app used to be highly informative, with information presented in a helpful and intuitive way. in the most recent upgrade, the interface uses lurid colours in childish bubblegum fonts, and the information is difficult to interpret. M ost offensive are the rounded ends of the data bars which serve no useful purpose. Previously, sleep patterns were extremely well presented. now it is less functional and the presentation is very unhelpful. A very negative upgrade",
            "I see why I'm getting the \"Oh Snap/No Data\" message all of a sudden...the app thinks it's Dec 2017! Yikes. The watch is a great idea, but the apps are bare bones and unreliable. The company should dedicate some of their marketing budget to improving service for those who've already bought the watch. The bad reviews will evetually negate the impressive sounding \"FDA Clearance.\"",
            "unfortunately I dont love the newer version of this app. I have noticed a lot of discrepancies in the information on the logged day such as sleep and waking times and activity. I personally track my sleep very closely due to my epilepsy issues and the new format makes the viewing of your quality of sleep and sleep patterns much more difficult to read. over all I would say that the previous format was more user friendly and easier to navigate.",
            "This app is a hit and a miss.. I need it to monitor sleep and nocturnal seizures for my son and 90% of the time, there's \"no recorded data\" but the phone is connected to the watch without issue. And the support people for this app suck, I've sent 2 emails have have gotten NO RESPONSE"

            "Really Nice... and Cool Features... but for a Price I was excited to start using this app. There have been many times where I get ideas for art projects, and experience feelings that can only be described in the given moment. It's easy to add entries and do quick check-ins multiple times a day and I was psyched to see the other journaling ideas... Until I saw that you have to spend $30/year for those features. So cruel to ad them just to say, \"Pay us! Minus that, I would give it 5 stars.",
            "The app has more intelligent offer than I expected. First, it is a great interface to use on any devices, web, phone, tablet so I'm happy to be able to access it any time. The note is simply minimal and well organized. I'm surprised that there are actually promt checkins and guided templates for different topics for journaling. I'm using more than I intended.",
            "So far so good very simple to use and the design and layout is appealing. Better than most I've tried recently. Option to upload multiple photos in one go rather than individually would be handy, and the ability to upload videos would be nice. Great experience so far though.",
            "it is a really good app, ive only just started using it and is very good compared to other diarys and mood journals ive had in the past. it is good even without the subscription as you have access to the diary feature, mood board and everything. the only reason im giving 4 stars is because i feel that the mood board could be a bit more in depth that just, \"pick a face, what activities made you feel this way, any other notes.\" i feel it needs a little more but it is a great app and i recomend it!",
            "Pay to use... Listen, If you guy offer this for free with a very LIGHT ad presence so you can get paid for the work out into creating this app, fine. If you want to offer the option to pay like 1 or 2 dollars to get rid of the ads, fine. Even if you roll out new amazing content, I mean serious content that you can't find elsewhere, not fonts, themes, backgrounds, photo insertion or that simple bs. But telling me to pay over $5 monthly when I can buy a $1 notebook? No, that is money grubbing."

            "Very detailed and user friendly app. 1 of...if not THE best \"In Case of Emergency\" app available. Works great as a free app, and even better when purchased. Free app is still useful even without full features, I recommend this and having worked in the ambulance service I wish people would use or have this on their phones more often, saving time is saving lives, this app could one day do just that. Developer is also friendly, helpful and punctual with responding to questions or help.",
            "FORCED TO GIVE A 🌟. 😡 COMPLETELY USELESS APP...unless you only have one allergy, take only one prescription, no contacts...etc. As soon as you try to enter a second listing of anything, you get a pop-up about upgrading to (and paying for) the premium version. If you have only one medication or allergy & no emergency contacts...this is the app for you. However, if you live in the real world...pass this one by. Looking for the app I had on my old phone ..unlimited entrees & 100% free.",

In case of any emergency situation, this application can be used as a medical contact card as well as it can also be useful to reach out to the emergency contacts if needed. It helps a lot and its literally Awesome!",

The app also gives an audio alert to anyone nearby - with instructions on how to provide you assistance.   You can even add 911 emergency services as one of your caregivers - so they can also receive a text and location.  The app continues to send texts every 30 seconds until the app is turned off by drawing a pattern on the screen. \r\n\r\nThe alert begins in a non-intrusive way - by asking how you are doing - to give you a chance to interrupt the alerting process if you accidentally hit the seizure button - before the text alerts go out.\r\n\r\nThe motion of your seizure is recorded onto our server where, in our upcoming version, algorithms are tailored so that the app (using your Android watch - and to a more limited extent your Android phone) can automatically detect that you're having a seizure (versus walking, biking, dancing, etc.) and send the alerts without you having to push the seizure button.\r\n\r\nSoterria Seizure Alert works with any Android smart phone and any Android watch.   The watch is optional - but when the app is able to detect seizures, it will detect them much more accurately if you are also wearing an Android watch.

            "Oct-25 : Any reason why the black color in screen is shown as white color in the lights? Can that not be considered for a change? Jan-2019 :This app has a lot of potential. I use it with my phone and also on my TV connected to Nvidia Shield Box. Works fine. Thanks for the application.",
            "Works awesome. Have it set up on my shield pro with plex and an lg OLED C9. As far as it not syncing with DRM content such as Netflix, Prime, Disney try running them in your chrome browser (sideload onto your android device like shield pro) and it should work. This is not the fault of the app as hue will not sync to DRM content even with the hue sync box. Make sure to set up your light placement in the hue app entertainment area as doing this gave me complete screen coverage with my 3 lights.",
            "I'm using this with a shield TV, i watch all my content through an app, so movies, live TV, series etc, all work really well. But if you watch through actual Netflix or prime etc, it won't work.. saved me buying a sync box for now",
            "It works with content that's not protected, so Netflix and other streaming apps do not work. Video files, certain apps, and games work. Best movie so far using this has been Godzilla King of Monsters"

            "I have been using the free version of this app. I have found this to be such a positive experience. I'm sleeping better and I fall asleep faster each time I use it. Soon I'll be falling asleep the minute I turn it on! I would purchase additional work by the creator but none seemed a good fit. I think I have what i need for now. Update, its been over a year now and this is still worked into my nightly routine. I find it soothing, pleasant and most importantly restful♥️.",
            "Very relaxing and puts me to sleep nearly every time! Favorite out of all styles (eg nature sounds, lullabies, etc), and I have tried dozens!. If it had a timer to go along with the loop feature, it would get five stars. That being said, it is infrequently that I need to listen more than once since it is amazingly effective. Shazzie truly does understand the flow in which various body parts will relax; and her voice is so calming; but the background music is just a bit low. Huge fan!",
            "Relaxing, even after years of listening. I used to go through so many meditation tracks as I would get sick of hearing the same voice, but I purchased the sleep easy and the love your body meditation, and 6 years on, I'm still loving it (at least 4 nights/week). Shazzi's voice is so comforting and the music is deeply touching.",

            "These apps are perfect. I use a few of them and it actually works, as well as teaching me about myself! I never used to be able to relax into hypnosis or meditation, but the ability to go back and try again with the same app the next day has me a pro! Have recommended to all family friends",

Easy to use and has plenty of space in each category for allergies, med list, conditions, surgeries or other general useful information in the event of an emergency.",

I have epilepsy absent seizures where I zone out into zombie mode, and this app has had all my medical info and my emergency contacts available for people around me twice, and has it there for any future incidents. Its simple to use, clear, and holds detailed info for medical services to draw upon. I've had issues with the emergency banner lock screen that annoyed me, but that's not to do with this app, more so android bullcrap.",

            "I have severe difficulty in falling asleep some nights, so bad that occasionally I'm up for 36 hours because I could not fall asleep at all. Also I've never been able to be hypnotized but last night I tried this app for the first time and within minutes of completing the First session I was asleep. Some nights it's pain that keeps me awake, and some nights it's my brain that won't wind down and allow me to rest and last night both were preventing me from getting to sleep until I tried this app.",
            "I've only spent $ to change the settings, so I'm only using the free track. I haven't noticed relief in my a.m. (fibromyalgia/arthritis) stiffness/achiness, but I sleep better. I also have ADHD, so focused relaxation and then hypnosis drop usually has me asleep quickly. I love how she phrases things (\"that all is just right\") and the slightly amused tone when she talks about toes. I've only gotten to the end 2x, and I've used the imagery during a nerve pain flare to calm it. Love this app!"

I could use my default calendar in the same manner.

Just to get rid of the intrusive ads you need to subscribe. Give your users an option to one time pay to get rid of the ads and keep your monthly subscription separate. I uninstalled the app."

            "I like the concept and that it's free. I just don't like how it asks you to add the types of attacks you get, and where it starts etc. You can't go through set up without doing this. So I basically could not complete set up because it's different everytime. My headaches don't always start on the left side, throb, at about a 6 for example. You should be able to choose these details at the time of the event that you are logging, not beforehand. Unfortunately I will be deleting 😔"

            "This is the first time I find a mood tracker or journal app which doesn't have to pay yearly or monthly! Moreover, I got a discount from Google Play which make it cheaper.. I feel very lucky, more optimistic creating daily habit of journaling with premium features.. Really love the visuals, simple yet elegant and artistic.. Keep up the good work! I hope I don't have any issues about data backup..",
            "I just downloaded the app and its really good, i really like how you can write all your thoughts and feelings. However, there are some negative things about this app. I wanted to add a passcode to the app so that no one can see all my thoughts and diaries, but it said that i had to pay. I don't think that is fair because i dont have the money to pay and it could be thesame for many other people and keeping your thoughts private on this app should be for free. Other than that, the app is good.",

I like this app because it has everything I need and the UI is very straight forward to use. It would be nice to have repeat reminder more than 6 times (like, until I cancel) as I have to use another app (Missed It) to act as a reminder. Pill Reminder is a good bit of coding and well thought out. I also like the sensible pricing option.... not much to pay for over 3 meds.",

It helped because if not it might have led to an anxiety attack and/or mental breakdown.",

            "I love it, I use the anxiety track and it actually does make me feel more calm most the time. Only thing that would be nice was if you could have the option for a timer. For example if I wanna play a track on repeat as I try to fall asleep but I don't want it still playing after I fall asleep. So if I could set it to stop playing after an hour or so. That would be great.",

        "description": "Anxiety Release based on EMDR shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process.  The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.\r\n\r\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of; \r\n1 x brain training session \r\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions \r\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual) \r\n1 x safe place exercise \r\nProgress Log function with prompts\r\nPowerful Bls brain visual simulating brain activity associated with anxiety reduction\r\n\r\nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and the general public.  However, persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision.\r\n\r\nThis app has been tested on Galaxy tab 2, Galaxy S4, and Google Nexus 7.",

            "This is an amazing app for use during virtual therapy sessions with a therapist! ... This app allows me to continue to use EMDR in my therapy sessions, during virtual sessions from home, due to the pandemic. ... I really enjoy the self-led functions for practice and reinforcement of anxiety-relieving behaviors, even when I am not overly stressed, as regular practice ingrains the behaviors so they become automatic in times of duress. ... I was quite relieved at the clear avoidance of faith/ideals or other topics besides simply healing from anxiety, in the sessions. Many other relaxation/calming apps speak of specific body parts (anxiety for an amputee), use religious wording (a trigger for those abused by \"the faithful\"), or visualization guidance that may contain phobias.This was what led me to believe that there were careful, thoughtful, conscientious mental health professionals involved in the creation of this healing tool. ... I told my therapist about this after I evaluated it's functions, and he is very excited to review it himself from a more clinical standpoint, with the intention of possibly suggesting it to his other virtual patients! ... To suggest an improvement; I would like to see a stereoscopic add-on for this app, as it would allow for distraction-free immersive VR functionality with even the most basic of headsets such as Google Cardboard, a huge boon for those of us with high distractability. I would accept this add-on as a micro-transaction within the app. I would suggest another improvement as well, buy my ideas have tangible value. ... (\"...\" Added to signify between paragraphs, as the review form turned my review into a difficult-to-read wall of text.",
            "Amazing app but please, please, get rid of or at least lower that guitar that comes on at the end of each session. I end each session feeling amazing then that guitar jarringly blares in my ear and undoes the relaxation. Begging the devs to edit the audio and remove or dramatically lower the guitar, I'd give 5 stars",
            "Wow! What an amazing app and process. For those of us without reasonable access to EMDR therapists, this app is perfect. Even the guided meditations alone are the best I've come across. I hope to see some more added later. I was 100% ready to mess with this app for about 5 minutes and then hit Refund. After giving it ago, hell i would pay way more for this level of content and the result I get! Thank you a million times for this hidden gem!",
            "Skeptical Until I Tried It... This app has helped me get over panic attacks (and anxiety attacks) in the moment they begin. It takes practice and patience but it worked for me. The guided eye movements with noise ear to ear....I know it's science...but I couldn't believe the state I was in after 5-10 minutes. This may be for you and it may not. We're all different, but as it's free, it's worth a shot. The first time I used this I was anxiety riddled on a plane and it got me through.",

EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \r\n\r\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\r\n\r\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\r\n\r\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients.

        "description": "Strobe Therapy regulates your brainwave by the rhythm of blinks of lights and leads you to a deeply relaxed state. If you use it when you go to bed, you can expect a good sound sleep. You can also expect it to reduce stress and to improve cognitive function.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to use the app. Just press a button, then the LED light of your phone will start blinking at high speed. Let the strobe lights hit your eyebrow center after you have closed your eyes. That is all.\r\n\r\nIt is highly effective for relaxation. Take the shower of the strobe lights without moving your body. While your eyes remain closed, you will start to see various things such as colorful geometric patterns, psychedelic mandalas, beautiful natural scenery, etc. As you relax deeply, what you can see will change. Just be aware of what you can see. It will naturally lead you to a deeply relaxed state.\r\n\r\nYou can't fully relax while you are holding a device in your hand, so it would be good to lie on your back and place the phone directly on your forehead. If the leak of the light disturbs your neighbors, cover it with a thick towel or something.\r\n\r\nIt's rare but, depending on your constitution, there may be danger of inducing photosensitive epilepsy. Please use this app at your own risk. If you are oversensitive to light, refrain from using this app. Besides that, excessive prolonged use of the app may induce side effects such as dizziness. Please take responsibility for adjusting your exposure time to the light.\r\n\r\nYou might think that you will be awakened by being showered with the strobe lights before you go to bed. But actually, it is mysteriously effective in making you relaxed. And somehow it seems to be good for eye fatigue too.\r\n\r\nThose who are insomnia, those who tend to think too much, those who do intellectual work right before they sleep, those who are restless and can't calm down, must try this app. Before the emergence of Strobe Therapy, this experience has been possible only by using a very expensive dedicated machine for meditation and therapy. \r\n\r\nAjina Light, created by Guy Harriman, is one of those dedicated machines (https://ajnalight.com). It is an excellent machine with much brighter lights than smartphones. But a problem with Ajina Light is its price. It costs 5555 US dollars! So it is not something that average people can buy and be able to use before going to sleep.\r\n\r\nStrobe Therapy is not only inexpensive. It has unique features that those dedicated machines do not have. In particular, the function that repeats multiple sets while placing break times is distinctive with this app. It is highly effective in relaxation.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious effects of flickering lights have long been known. Ptolemy, an ancient Roman scientist, generated flickering with sunlight and a spinning wheel. He noticed that a feeling of euphoria could be experienced by that. Modern French psychologist Pierre Janet used it to relieve hysteria. Aldous Huxley, the author of Perception Door, noted that flickering lights have a similar effect to hallucinogens such as LSD and Mescaline.\r\n\r\nSeveral scientific studies have revealed that brain waves can be controlled by the frequency of strobe lights. In 2016, Nature published a scientific paper that shows amyloid β, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, can be removed from the brain of mice by strobe lights.",

Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",

Additionally it assumes that medications are only used as an abortive measure instead of as maintenance to prevent.

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

I use it to turn my screen red at night so it doesn't ruin my night vision. Don't pay attention to the negative ads that say the developer is misleading. The description is one of the best you will read.",

(Some bugs) they walk the cell screen until I change it to LIGHT BLUE.--They stop walking! Or walk the perimeter of the screen and avoid to L. Blue. This app is the Agar for bugs. Awesome! Developer: Can you program a few buttons to Recall the wavelenghts saved? Thank you so much!",
            "It works... The ads kill the vibe from time to time... But that's why it's free. Unless you have different colored LEDs on your phone. The color change occurs in the screen. Taking showers with the lights off with a colored screen light on... Definitely sets a mood. But the white light from the ads kill the vibe.",
            "This is a useful app. I miss the possibility of paying to stop ads. It's very easy to accidentally touch the banner ad, and then the app disappears and there comes an add you never intended to open. It gets in the way of the usefulness.",
            "i cant say i didn't expect it to make my flashlight shine different colors except white, but you shouldn't mislead people into thinking the flashlight itself would change colors and not just the screen. if you want your flashlight to be a different color then use a marker on clear tape and put it over the light."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",

This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "This is awesome app! But it has one issue: There NEEDS to be LESS in app purchases, (Ex. I try to put an aurora sky, but it won't let me, I have to pay). Otherwise, it is a great app! I especially love the \"Animation\" feature, however, I don't see why it loops the way it does, (Ex. I try to make a bus move. Instead, it warps the bus a ton, and it looks like it is a rubber bus, and that a giant with invisible arms is twisting it. Otherwise, this is a great app!",
            "First it was nice. Tutorial was easy. But I got a bug. The picture I recently finished editing covered my entire phone screen. As if it has been an overlay wallpaper but I couldn't see anything. It stayed in the screen. I tried locking and unlocking but it's still there. I can press applications other random applications behind the pic but it kept staying there. Had to restart and uninstall",
            "Pretty Cool App. I'm glad you can buy it out right if you want. I went with the $20 for a year option. I think it's worth it if I use it allot and I think I will. It has some great effects. I'm impressed with how well it masks my subject in the foreground from the background. It's pretty easy to get up and running with this. I'm having allot of fun with it right now. I'm doing product shots and bringing them to life with this. It's pretty cool. 😎👍 Edit, love the new overlays and updates! 🙂👍",
            "Let's get something straight, it's not a completely free app. However, when you buy the premium, it's worth it! I've literally gained thousands of fans on my Facebook page, \"The Rise: Story of Trunks.\" If you go on that page, you'll see the work put in solely using this app. They just need to add more options like being able to add more than four element selections and more \"overlay's.\" Besides that, it is a five star rated app.",
            "I Love the app! I'm going into my second year using premium and its worth it for what i use, and perfect for what i do... The only real complaint i have is PLease, give us an option to FLIP THE ASSETS. for now we have to leave the selected asset in the developers original position. yes We can turn them and change sizes, but if the option to flip it from side to side and up or down, that would solve my only issue with this app. Thanks also for adding useful unique assets regularly."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "I've been trying to listen every night before sleep, I set it to loop but the app just shuts itself off. I switched to this app because the last quit smoking app I used did the exact same thing (it was free) - very annoyed that I paid for this, only to receive the same result.",
            "I paid for the app too fast. After 7 days of listening to same words again and again, the only motivation to not to smoke that I had was because I just didn't want to listen to it again and imagine that bloody elevator. I still smoked though. I only stopped thanks to Niquitin patches that I started using few weeks after I quit this app. The only good thing about it is that it gets so boring after few days that falling asleep is not an issue anymore",
            "This is the only thing that has really managed to help me stop smoking! But, you have to really WANT to stop smoking and listen to this meditation regularly in order for it to work.",
            "I have stopped smoking! I have to put it down to this app! Don't get me wrong, I want one every now and then, but that itchy need to have one has disappeared. Now I couldn't care less. Before I would have rushed to the shop the minute I ran out of cigs, I ran out last week and just carried on with my life. Smoke free finally!",
            "I couldn't believe how well the hypnotism part worked. I'm still smoking but the 30 days isn't up yet."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

I don't know who's voice that is but it's so soothing and makes me unwind instantly! Don't change a thing! Thank you to the creators of this app. It's been a God send for my healing from anxiety.",
            "I've been on a severe anxiety attack that went on for 3 days. I was considering hypnosis through a consultant but stumbled upon this app. I paid the extra $$ to move the hypno sound all the way up and to put it on loop so it can play while I'm asleep. After the 1st night of listening my anxiety attack was 70% gone. 2nd night no anxiety. I've downloaded a couple of other hypnosis apps, self esteem, fear and exercise. *UPDATE* It'd be great if I could play all of the apps i unlocked while I sleep",
            "Free yet not free. Although it said the app was free, once you try it, you discover many features are not available until you upgrade to a paid version, never mentioned on the download page. It was impossible to evaluate with so many features unusable.",
            "This had become 1 of my go-to apps at the end of the day. If you don't over expect any sudden results. I just allow it to give me at least 30 min of mindfulness. When used at night I do find I sleep better.",
            "Thankful that it doesn't ask for personal details (name, age, address etc) great job 👍 wish more apps were like this. Straight to the point"

            "I purchased a year subscription a couple months ago. It was great now in this last week it has so many glitches and each item doesn't want to open takes forever! And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I think the game is good but it needs to improve on : Less adds, Easy medium hard levels, Chat with friends, Less adds, Hope you have a little play around with your game and see what I'm talking about . Also the adds are constant it's like 20 seconds playing and 2 minuets watching adverts . Thanks you for you understanding and time .",
            "Get the game it is so much fun because you can even it's so easy to slide so much fun and you can't get no ads for free to get it now so much but I can't believe it just that it is so much fun. I got one reason or 3 okay three reason why it's because whatever you decide it's super easy and you can get knowing at the second reason why is because it is just a speakable unspeakable.",
            "This game is really fun! The only problem is the prices when you want to buy a random character or random skates it gets more and more expensive. Please fix this problem. Other than that its pretty fun!",

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "I've redownload this game on different phones over the years and do really enjoy the game. But one issue seems consistent despite the device. Maybe it's because I have little fingers but the movements aren't always accurate and it gets really frustrating when you get to higher speeds. I try to slide over and end up jumping instead. Or flat out don't move at all and go splat into the train I was trying to avoid in the first place. It's fun and a good game but the tolerances need to be better.",
            "I haven't played this game for a very long time, but after reinstalling it again recently, all I can say is... Good job on this masterpiece! Seriously, this game is better than I remember! The only reason I vote it for 4 stars is because there are ads popping up on the home screen. Other than that, keep up the good work! 🙌🏼",
            "Amazing game, one of the \"originals\"- I remember when everyone I knew had this game- and it's continued to develop amazingly! One idea though, would be an option to change the theme, as I, personally, prefer to other themes than the current (Halloween) one. This would be a really nice thing to see added, but still a great game either way! Thank you!",
            "I understand why ads are necessary but what I hate about is the \"UnityAds\" are always crashing my game and it automatically closing the game. \"Google Ads\" are better, it does not crash my game. Still 3 stars for now. Hope you removed all the \"Unity Ads\" in the app. It spoils my experiences in the game. Reported this issue already to your support team. Still waiting for a response. Please?

Its a game to kill time. I love it sooooooooo much👌👌😊😊 its better than other games and its name is also very very good. It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up 👍👍",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. 😡 My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. 🤔 Hopes this helps people who have read this information 😁 bye peeps! 👋😎"

            "Honestly, you can't do much without paying £3+. Even small, petty things like leave the music playing after the spoken meditation/hypnosis has finished. Or even more petty, turn off the 'wake up' sound at the end. You have to pay if you want to turn that off. All a bit pathetic. The meditation/hypnosis itself is nice, a decent length with a soothing background. You have to listen each time to a whole speech on how it works first, unless, of course, you pay to get rid of it.",
            "This is a great app! The background music is wonderful. It's very relaxing and calming. I have been searching for some way to be happy, and calm again, for two years now. Because of this app, I got to expirience that, so thank you. I would very much recommend this to anyone who is seeing this.",
            "I just love this app. This is so gentle and kind, and reaches way deep inside my heart and mind. Thank you Surf City! Your series of apps have changed my very core to a stronger and more peaceful version of myself.",
            "Relaxed, simple voice instruction is used to reach a suggestible hypnotic mindset. There is a number countup from 1 to 10 as you are physically and mentally relaxed by the narrator's pleasant voice. Then generally positive messages are introduced.",
            "Thank you so much for this app! I am going through the most critical stage of life where i couldn't sleep for a week straught due to my anxiety and depression. This application literally helped me in sleeping better last night. Thank you so much for this application again. Spending a few bucks to buy it was worth it!"

Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos.

            "Extortion. The female voice is amazingly pleasant...the first few seconds. But to shut her up so you can sleep right away requires a fee. Not a value-added way of increasing app registrations. Is akin to extortion. Her monotone droning instructions are painful to endure when trying to sleep. She has a nice voice. But the instructions are annoying to listen through again and again. And again. 'Fall asleep fast' as claimed? Nope. Could not fall asleep with this app even once. :/",
            "Ive been struggling with insomnia and aniexty for a few months which literally caused me to fear going to sleep. Downloaded this app a few weeks ago and its helped me so much! I listen to it ever night and I feel so relaxed. I used to listen to the whole recording but now I'm fast asleep before the recording finishes! Would highly recommended to those suffering with aniexty and/or struggling to fall asleep!!",
            "my go to fall asleep app.... i loved it so much so i purchased the full version and i do love it,, would be cool if it recorded noise when you fall asleep becuz im a night terror gal i have them bad.. itd be nice to hear whats going on in my surroundings when that happens to me.. also sleep apnea.. itd b nice to hear how many times i gasp for breath.. but i have an app for that too lol this is greatttt for putting me into a deeeeeep comfy sleep i dont even remember falling into big thanks",
            "Amazing! Totally fixed my sleepless nights! I would give 5 stars but I always have to uninstall and reinstall app because its starts cracking during hypnosis and eventually shuts down...super annoying!",
            "great sleep app I've been using it for over a year now and is definitely a favorite. Reasonable price for extra features. Easy to adjust meditation preferences. I love the progressive muscle relaxation technique & gratitude practice. And often I am asleep within minutes of starting the app now. The night's I don't sleep easily, it calms me down and helps me relax at least."

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "It's a good app. I'm getting aggravated waiting for Android customisation of the avatars though. They're busy adding new topics (almost rushing to add, that word spelling is sometimes wrong) so they're doing something just not delivering on avatar customisation (app itself says coming soon but it's lying, it's been saying that since I downloaded the app MONTHS ago) it's as if they can't be a***d",
            "Still no customization for android user (played this 2 months ago and back now. New feature for android my ass. Too many obsure usa question, too many bots, too many ads (skip the ad for more ads). I spent money on this game, worst mistake ever.",
            "It's okay. But it still hasn't updated the avatars for Android users to be able to customize them. Also, this app still has an issue with shutting itself off when I didn't request it to do so.",
            "Absolutely LOVE! THE perfect one on one trivia match! Questions moderately difficult to where one of you are going to know 90% of it. Just perfect. My first review on any game ever!",
            "The game is good. But it still does not has the feature where android users can customise their avatars. Thats the only reason i have deducted 2 stars."

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

        "description": "Cara mengobati epilepsi secara alami menjadi alternatif bagi penderita yang seringkali mengalami serangan epilepsi. Serangan epilepsi dapat terjadi kapan saja dan dimana saja. Serangan epilepsi umumnya terjadi secara tiba-tiba dan berlangsung dalam waktu yang cukup singkat.\r\n\r\nNamun tetap saja hal ini cukup membahayakan bagi penderitanya. Oleh karena itu sebisa mungkin penyakit ini harus segera diobati. Adapun beberapa cara alami yang dapat dilakukan untuk cara mengobati epilepsi secara alami antara lain sebagai berikut.\r\n\r\n1. Daun Inggu\r\n\r\nDaun inggu dapat digunakan untuk mencegah timbulnya penyebab kejang tanpa demam pada penderita epilepsi. Daun inggu bisa dijadikan semacam ramuan. Caranya adalah dengan mencampurkan segenggam daun inggu pada sedikit cuka encer.\r\n\r\nJangan lupa untuk meremas-remas daun inggu yang tercampur cuka tersebut. Ramuan ini hanya digunakan untuk pengobatan luar. Misalnya dengan menggunakannya sebagai kompres di kepala penderita epilepsi yang sedang mengalami kejang.\r\n\r\n2. Kembang Coklat\r\n\r\nKembang coklat biasa dijadikan sebagai larutan yang bisa digunakan untuk menurunkan kejang pada anak yang menderita epilepsi. Larutan ini dapat dibuat dengan cara mengambil 10 gram kembang coklat serta gula batu secukupnya. Kemudian kedua bahan tersebut direbus. Hasil rebusan tersebut kemudian dapat diminumkan pada anak yang mengalami gejala kejang. Sehingga dengan demikian epilepsi juga otomatis dapat mereda dengan sendirinya.\r\n\r\n3. Kapulaga\r\n\r\nKapulaga juga dapat berfungsi untuk mengobati kejang pada penderita epilepsi. Cara membuatnya adalah dengan mengambil seluruh bagian dari tumbuhan kapulaga termasuk akarnya. Kemudian seluruh bagian tumbuhan tersebut direbus kurang lebih selama 15 menit. Hasil rebusan tersebut kemudian disaring. Air hasil saringan bisa diminum oleh orang yang mengalami kejang. Ramuan ini harus diminum setiap hari agar penyakit ciri-ciri epilepsi pada anak dapat dicegah dan disembuhkan.\r\n\r\n4. Bunga Tunjung\r\n\r\nBunga tunjung umumnya diberikan pada anak yang mengalami gejala kejang dan pingsan. Ramuan yang bisa diminum ini dibuat dengan cara merebus 3 sampai dengan 4 kuntum bunga tunjung serta 6 sampai dengan 9 gram akar tunjung. Bahan-bahan tersebut direbus kurang lebih selama 15 menit hingga menjadi segelas air.\r\n\r\nJangan lupa untuk menyaringnya sehingga air hasil saringan dapat diminumkan pada anak yang sedang terserang gejala epilepsi. Untuk anak yang mengalami pingsan sebaiknya teteskan ramuan ini sedikit demi sedikit padanya hingga ia sadar kembali. \r\n\r\n5. Tahi Kotok\r\n\r\nTahi kotok juga bisa diberikan pada anak yang sedang mengalami gejala kejang. Caranya adalah dengan menyiapkan 5 sampai dengan 15 gram bunga tahi kotok yang telah kering. Lalu rebuslah bunga tersebut ke dalam 2 gelas air selama kurang lebih 15 menit. Setelah itu saringlah. Air hasil saringan dapat segera diminumkan pada anak yang terserang kejang.\r\n\r\n6. Pule Pandak\r\n\r\nPule pandak dapat dipakai sebagai cara mengobati epilepsi secara alami yang dialami oleh semua orang baik dewasa maupun anak-anak. Ramuan ini bisa dibuat dengan cara mengambil 0,7 gram akar pule pandak lalu memasukkannya ke dalam 110 ml air. Rebuslah akar pule pandak di dalam air tersebut dengan menggunakan api kecil selama kurang lebih 15 menit. Ramuan ini sebaiknya diminum sekali dalam sehari dengan takaran sebanyak 100 ml.\r\n\r\n7. Cabe Jawa\r\n\r\nCabe jawa bermanfaat untuk mengatasi gangguan pencernaan serta kejang otot yang dialami oleh penderita epilepsi. Cabe jawa dapat dijadikan sebuah ramuan untuk diminum oleh penderita gejala epilepsi setiap hari. Untuk membuat ramuan tersebut perlu disiapkan 6 gram cabe jawa mentah dan kering untuk ditumbuk. Hasil tumbukan dapat ditambah madu sehingga ramuan cabe jawa dan madu tersebut bisa diminum.",

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

We update the game every week so don&#39;t forget to download the latest version to get all the sweet new features and levels!<br><br>New to the game? Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "This app is absolutely incredible. It has so many drawing and you can create your own drawing. On my second day I colored 5 drawings already. This app is just fantastic. I always get new awards. However, there are so many adds. Which I do not like. I absolutely hate it. Although, all the adds do remove but you have to pay money. It was a fantastic app. I really love the app. I would be shock if anyone rated this a one star. I just cannot believe that.💙💙💙😀",
            "Really good, I was having problems with a other paint by number and it got a little boring so I decided to get this one. This never gets boring for me and has so many puzzles. I also like how it is divided in different genres, it makes it easier to find what I want to do and find specific things that may be hard to see. There is just one problem: I allowed my camera and It still won't let me make custom art, very sad but it's only one problem which I can get from other pixel art apps so it's ok.",
            "Honestly, this game has to be one of my favorite apps in my phone! It just makes me feel so creative and happy. When I'm a little bit sad or maybe just bored, I play this game and it just makes me feel so happy! Also, just to point out, when the other pictures, like, is kinda special, you can just watch an ad and its free! Well, despite the other option which is to get the premium, its fine! So, I am highly reccomending this game to kids, teens, adults, every age!",
            "I absolutely love this game. There are many kinds of drawings to color . I love that the game has different categories to chose from. If you want to color a special drawing it takes 1 add to get it, Well for me it does. I color at least 15 drawings a day. This game is a calming game and a relaxing game. This game is a great game to play in quarantine too. THE END",
            "I love this game, dont get me wrong. Though there is this issue that happens quite a lot when I'm coloring in pictures. I'll be filling/coloring in a picture of something and then there will be a color missing. And I cant find it even when I click the bulb to find it it cant, and then I cant finish the coloring page. Hope you can fix that. 😐"

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "Nice idea. But, you can't control which lights are in scope for the disco, effectively making all lights across the house and outside the house part of a disco that takes place in the living room. Not good. Also, not all my color lights were controlled for some reason, they'd simply stay in previous state or off. Furthermore, all your ambience spot lights take no part in the disco, nor will your switches and dimmers that are connected to the Hue Bridge. Nice try, but not quite there yet.",
            "AWFUL! App used to be good... This app used to actually use microphone input to control what the lights did based on sound. Now no matter what is on or not on when using the app the lights have a mind of their own. Super disappointed to be honest.",
            "Love love love this app. I just discovered it and realized I can sync all rooms in my home to match the music I'm playing. Easy to use. Good price for the app. I love it.",

If i put mic sensitivity at music dancing level, which higher than noice level, can see no reaction on bits. If put it lover(lefter), it starting flashes on the some noice, rhyme of flashes have nothing similar with music rhyme. Need to fix it....",

And since I have no sdcard and you can't specify an email address I tried but could not create a backup or export file. So while I love what it does not having export or backup capability is a show stopper for me. Perhaps the reason the data got wiped with the update is the location of the storage for the app - which I could not find with my file manager.",

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",

Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",

I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "It's a good game. The only issue I have so far is the asinine campaign leveling system. Need to gain levels in order to unlock new stages. I was waiting 2-3 days just to get to 68. Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

When the app detects seizure-like motions, it instantly alerts caregivers via text message and call alerts, ensuring that the user gets help on time. Additionally, the app gathers comprehensive data from events (date, time, duration, intensity, audio, and parameters in graphical form) which can then be shared with doctors/neurologists to aid in providing better care. \r\n\r\nInspyre also features a ‘summon help’ emergency button, GPS location in the text message alerts, medication reminders, heart rate recording and symptom reporting functionalities. The motion alert app allows for motion sensitivity alterations, allowing the user to adjust the sensitivity and duration of movement they would like the Inspyre to detect and alert upon, which can minimize false alarms during the day time and pick up on slighter abnormal motions during periods of sleep. It provides caregivers with peace of mind and allows the user to take back their independence.\r\n\r\nInspyre by SmartMonitor Features:\r\n\r\n• Detects Abnormal Motion\r\n\r\n• Instantly Alerts Caregivers and Loved Ones\r\n\r\n• Summons Help at the Press of a Button\r\n\r\n• Securely Access Event Data\r\n\r\n• GPS-Enabled Location Sharing\r\n\r\n• Medication Reminders & Notifications\r\n\r\n• Heart Rate Data Collection\r\n\r\n• Symptom Reporting\r\n\r\nIN THE MEDIA\r\n\r\nPRweb.com\r\n\r\n“Smart Monitor’s Inspyre is a valuable tool for families of patients who have epileptic seizures,” said Dr. Robert S. Fisher MD, Professor of Neurology at Stanford. “It can provide timely alerting, reassurance, and increased safety.”\r\n\r\nDr. Sanjaya Kumar MD, Chief Medical Officer, added, “Smart Monitor’s technology platform and connected coordinated care solutions are changing the landscape for management of complex chronic conditions with real-time access to data and insights that were never available before. This has been demonstrated to reduce the use of high cost healthcare services and may result in longer periods of remission and control, thereby decreasing the overall cost burden.”\r\n\r\nEpilepsy.com\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The SmartWatch has helped improve safety for many people over the years. By detecting when seizures with repeated movements occur, a person can get help sooner,\" said epilepsy.com Editor-in-Chief Dr. Joseph I Sirven. \"The new advances in SmartWatch Inspyre using Apple Watch will make this technology more accessible to many more people with epilepsy.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\nConnect with us:\r\n\r\nWeb - http://www.smart-monitor.com\r\n\r\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/smartmonitor\r\n\r\nTwitter - @1Smartwatch\r\n\r\nInstagram - @smart-monitor\r\n\r\nSupport – Submit a support ticket at Inspyre™ Support, email Smart Monitor at support@smart-monitor.com, or call us at USA Toll Free: 1 (888) 334-5045/International: 1 (408) 754-1695",

Additionally, the app gathers comprehensive data from events (date, time, duration, intensity, audio, and parameters in graphical form) which can then be shared with doctors/neurologists to aid in providing better care. <br><br>Inspyre also features a ‘summon help’ emergency button, GPS location in the text message alerts, medication reminders, heart rate recording and symptom reporting functionalities. The motion alert app allows for motion sensitivity alterations, allowing the user to adjust the sensitivity and duration of movement they would like the Inspyre to detect and alert upon, which can minimize false alarms during the day time and pick up on slighter abnormal motions during periods of sleep. It provides caregivers with peace of mind and allows the user to take back their independence.<br><br>Inspyre by SmartMonitor Features:<br><br>• Detects Abnormal Motion<br><br>• Instantly Alerts Caregivers and Loved Ones<br><br>• Summons Help at the Press of a Button<br><br>• Securely Access Event Data<br><br>• GPS-Enabled Location Sharing<br><br>• Medication Reminders &amp; Notifications<br><br>• Heart Rate Data Collection<br><br>• Symptom Reporting<br><br>IN THE MEDIA<br><br>PRweb.com<br><br>“Smart Monitor’s Inspyre is a valuable tool for families of patients who have epileptic seizures,” said Dr. Robert S. Fisher MD, Professor of Neurology at Stanford. “It can provide timely alerting, reassurance, and increased safety.”<br><br>Dr. Sanjaya Kumar MD, Chief Medical Officer, added, “Smart Monitor’s technology platform and connected coordinated care solutions are changing the landscape for management of complex chronic conditions with real-time access to data and insights that were never available before. This has been demonstrated to reduce the use of high cost healthcare services and may result in longer periods of remission and control, thereby decreasing the overall cost burden.”<br><br>Epilepsy.com<br><br> <br><br>&quot;The SmartWatch has helped improve safety for many people over the years. By detecting when seizures with repeated movements occur, a person can get help sooner,&quot; said epilepsy.com Editor-in-Chief Dr. Joseph I Sirven. &quot;The new advances in SmartWatch Inspyre using Apple Watch will make this technology more accessible to many more people with epilepsy.&quot;  <br><br><br>Connect with us:<br><br>Web - http://www.smart-monitor.com<br><br>Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/smartmonitor<br><br>Twitter - @1Smartwatch<br><br>Instagram - @smart-monitor<br><br>Support – Submit a support ticket at Inspyre™ Support, email Smart Monitor at support@smart-monitor.com, or call us at USA Toll Free: 1 (888) 334-5045/International: 1 (408) 754-1695",

            "I am so disappointed in this app. I paid 60 bucks to get it activated and be able to use only to find out it doesn't even work. Super frustrating. Plus I have sent emails regarding the fact that I want my money back and nothing. I call customer service and it goes to voice mail. I am going to be calling my bank to get this off my monthly statement. Please don't use this app or company as they are only interested in your money not your well being and happiness as a customer.",
            "Tried for 30 days, it goes off from barely any motion( son playing), worse part is they wont stop charging my credit card every month after cancelling and they dont respond to emails and even after disputing the charges with my cc company and my cc company won they charged my card again...dont get this app!!!! Scam if you ask me!!!",
            "Instructions are very unclear, but I did it and it seem to send alerts when I shake my hand. It was VERY unclrear: 1. I need to register on the website first and pay there 2. if Samsung Galaxy Active 2 is supported, because only the first version (not 2) is in the list. 3. if I will pay 40$ for nothing. 4. how to install the Inspyre app on the watch in addition to the phone. The manual MUST be shown before paying and activation to make it clear. But this app works and there is no other app."

            "I really enjoyed this app it's actually really cool! Now that it was Holloween I tried it... Yes it is neat. The only issue is that you can use the app just to see if you like it and it will give you a lot of options but I didn't like that if you didn't purchase this app... You get cut off and you cut off your potential customers to early I understand that you're goal is to make money off your app.Im not sure about the purchase I don't know what more it has to offer just get cut off .",
            "When signing up for monthly pro, the app tells you your first 3 days are free and \"at the end of the 3 day trial period an auto-renewable subscription will be activated automatically.\" This is a lie! There is no free trial; you will be charged immediately! Luckily I disputed the charges with Google and got my money back, but beware y'all, there is no free trial, regardless of what my screenshot of the app clearly says.",
            "This is an awesome app! There are two paid option that are reasonable and so worth it. With so many cool options and features that are available to try for free you will definitely stay busy and will want to the paid version and the more you share the smarter the app gets so you can't go wrong. I Definitely recommend this app.",
            "Luv 💗. I use this app all the time. I love it. The only thing id say it needs to improve on is the fact that there are not many options that work for group photos. Most onky work for selfies",
            "I dropped off the one star and reduced it to zero. The devs responded about getting the 1 year option and everything was wrong. Here's what you have to do: cancel your subscription and wait for a little bit. You will then have MANY places where they nag you to go PRO and from there you can choose either subscription option. You cannot do like the dev said. This is sure a lot more trouble than it's worth. UNINSTALLED! ---ORIGINAL review: I'm giving this ONE star because of their business model. Like other's, the first thing I saw was an offer of 3 day free trial with $4.99 PER MONTH after, plus another offer (that I can no longer find) for $9.99 per year. I might go for the yearly option except for the fact that everything they do seems shady. There are NO options and that includes no way within the app to tell it not to send notifications. I immediately was targeted with a notification and after a few of those, I had to go into the phone's notification settings to block them. They constantly nag me to share my pictures on their web site so they can have free use of my creations which they make it VERY difficult to remove what you shared and changed your mind. The online website provides NO options to delete your shares. Somewhere, I saw a recommendation for this app but it didn't give a clue about how expensive it was (even on the App Store, there is little to warn you). You find this out right away when you first run it. Positive note: the app itself is very fun and very addictive. It's all internet based functions, very little is actually on the phone taking up your memory. If you have weak internet or poor signal, this will be frustrating slow. If I can't find the overpriced $9.99 per year option, I'm not continuing this grossly overpriced monthly subscription. It's fun, but not THAT fun. With the lack of information and options, I am suspect of this company's motives. There is so much wrong with this company and it's functions it's kind of scary."

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",

The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Honestly, I don't think I've played a mobile game anywhere near as good as this one. Not only is the game beautifully polished, from the art, to the gameplay to the sounds, but it's also completely free from all the things that ruin mobile gaming. There are no ads, and the in-app purchases are completely optional. The game is just as fun whether or not you shell out money. The fact that this game is free to play is honestly a miracle. Undoubtedly one of the best mobile games out there.",
            "I got Pokémon Cafe Mix on the Nintendo Switch when it first came out and I have absolutely loved it so far but I really wish I can transfer my data to the mobile version from the switch so I don't have to start all over again and have to do all the missions just to get the Pokémon that come in. Is there a way to actually transfer it to your phone?",
            "Firstly the art style is gorgeous and actually makes me appreciate some of the pokemon I never did before. Secondly there's so many different obstacles that make a lot of rounds feel unique. Overall, quite enjoyable. Once I get into it it's a bit hard to stop!",
            "Super cute! I was having doubts whether to install it or not, when I installed the game man, it was so worth it, nice artwork, very calm gameplay I could just tap all Pokémon while eating and disturb them lol... I just wish that I could design the cafe my own way thou and have a much more open experience in having to design and buy stuff (I don't know if such a feature exist I just started) all in all super cute, and satisfying gameplay thumbs up! :3",
            "Thus game is fabulous! Good for some time pass or whenever bored, there are many pokemons to work with in the cafe! Overall i love it, and i would strongly recommend this to parents also as this could be a nice game for your kids and who knows, you can engage as well! So download thus app and don't keep thos adorable pokemons waiting!!😊👍"

            "Fellow Android users, let me assist you! I had the same issues with the \"Live View\" capabilities after the recent update. Here is the fix. If you have the Arlo 2 and are not using AC power, delete all of your camera Activity Zones. You will have to go into each camera setting and open the Activity Zone. If you see a zone, swipe it to the left and it will delete the zone. Do the same for all and this should fix your issue.",
            "The camera picture is nice. But half the time it doesn't work. I'll get notification for movement but the camera will take so long to load sometimes that I could have just gone outside to where it was. The app takes super long to load and when looking at my library it ofter says \"there's nothing here\" or \"there was a problem and the arlo team is working on it\" (no they're not). Ice been on the phone many times with their customer service and it's a joke.",
            "I've been using for 2 years just fine. Now, I am also having the same issues as others. Says its not connected to power, when the battery is still full. It also will NOT let me log in 9/10 times saying \"You are not connect tonthe internet, please check your connection\" My connection to everything in this house is great. We have the highest internet available and even resetting the camera doesn't seem to help. This is my childs monitor, and this problem needs to be fixed.",
            "It was bad enough that it would take forever for this app to open up at times. Now, since I updated this app yesterday, I'm not able to view my cameras. 'AC power has been disconnected from your Arlo device. Activity Zones are currently disabled.' With a green OK box below. That's the message I have on all my cameras. I tap on the box but nothing happens. Fix, fix, fix!!!",
            "Most recent app update made things go from bad to worse. All of my cameras that run on battery now indicate a 'no AC power'message in the app. So I cannot view the cameras at all. And my one camera that does run on AC recently stopped recording at night. Support was not helpful. They told me to remove and reconnect the camera (which is mounted above the garage so not an easy task.) I did that. But the problem persists. They stopped responding to my support ticket. Arlo is useless."

Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms - children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. <br><br>The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions:<br>•\tPlay in a well-lit room<br>•\tDo not play when you are drowsy or fatigued<br>If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.",

            "Great game that is similar to geometry dash but different enough to be enjoyable without feeling like a knock off. I like that it progressively gets harder and isn't too easy like many other games; it actually challenges you. It's also cool that a new element is added in each level to keep it interesting. Would rate 5 stars if it didn't have so many adds, and maybe if controlling the ship wasn't such a struggle, which isnt necessarily bad as it adds an extra challenge and you can get used to it",
            "I like this game, but I hate the one thing: If you win, reward is an ad. If you lose, punishment is an ad.",
            "It's a great game! I thought it would be some knock-off of geometry dash, but I was totally surprised! It's fun, challenging, and the gameplay is great. I've only made it half way through tho",
            "This game needs to cut back on the advertisements and needs to be less harsh on smartphone/tablet. The controls are simple and easy to understand. Music is catchy and upbeat sucks you into the game. The visuals are fun but just way too distracting. The game also needs to be a bit more forgiving when you're on the easier beats for people to pick up the rhythm more easily. (Example of this would be like a ghost hit 3 strikes or penalties that aren't as harsh as QUICK WATCH THIS AD AND START OVER!",
            "This is by far the most entertaining game I've played in a long time. It has a decent challenge to it, not enough to be aggravating but not too little to be easy to finish without much trouble (couple hundred attempts of trouble) I must say thank you to the developers and I hope you continue to make great games and even add on to this one (or a sequel thing is cool too) sincerely, A very satisfied gamer! P.S I dig the backgrounds and overall levels of the game, bright and in your face like I like it!"

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

            "If anyone has ever tried the Keto diet, it can be incredibly tough. Finding foods that are low and carbs and taste good was very difficult. I was so close to just stopping the diet because I literally hated almost everything I was eating. Then, it clicked, I bet someone out there had these same thoughts. After looking around I finally found this cookbook. My goodness, this one is a life saver. It has a plethora of different recipes that use SIMPLE ingredients.",
            "Love love love this app. Best one I've come across so far. Every recipe is so easy to follow and that says a lot because I never step foot in the kitchen.. until I started Keto. This app gave me motivation to stick with it. This app has made cooking fun!! AND EASY!",
            "With this app I will have the capacity to cook genuine nourishment amid occupied occasions as opposed to being enticed to get pre-bundled or remove sustenances. I have seen numerous keto apps with such huge numbers of extraordinary fixings that most home cooks don't have. There is nothing more baffling than purchasing heaps of flavors that may be utilized for a solitary formula that I may never make again. The app is extremely efficient and it's extremely simple to discover what you need to cook"

Take them on an ADVENTURE of a lifetime - build a base, explore mysteries or forage treasures. Learn the art of crafting, foraging and exploring but keep in mind, there is never an idle moment in the everyday lives of the survivors.\r\n\r\n⚓ ⚓ ⚓\r\nFIGHT vicious enemies, tame savage beasts, kindle romance and solve RIDDLES. When the island SPEAKS to you, will you answer?\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n➾ Lead a band of island survivors using simple swipes\r\n➾ Choose your own adventure and try to survive\r\n➾ Explore a huge lush world\r\n➾ Experience a talking island\r\n➾ Fight many dangers that lurk behind every bush\r\n➾ Forage resources to survive\r\n➾ Build a base and upgrade structures\r\n➾ Match, stack and collect flowers in a cool mini game\r\n➾ Craft weapons and tools\r\n➾ Discover a gripping storyline\r\n➾ Uncover the terrible secret of Tinker Island\r\n\r\nThree survivors find themselves shipwrecked and lost, not by choice, on what is believed to be a tropical deserted island. As they start exploring and discovering Tinker Island, they find great treasures, forage resources, build buildings and items that they need to gather, craft, build or harvest to protect themselves against the unfamiliar environment and the dangerous episodes awaiting them. A normal guy, a tourist onboard a ship, is forced to become a forager, a fighter, a true hero in this mini world adventure game. Find mysterious ancient villages and buildings, left behind by either wayward settlers or scum, discover an unknown civilization, uncover steampunk contraptions, covered with rust and almost unidentifiable. Not only is there no wifi in the caves on the islands, the whole thing is nowifi. \r\n\r\nAs you progress and craft the needed tools, you slowly uncover the map, the monument, valley, the stars, the mountain and the treasures of the islands. If things don't pan out, retry. And then retry again. One hour, one life, yolo. There is plenty of wit and humor in the narrative, where you have to make the correct choices to progress through the story. Gather the needed resources to upgrade your buildings and unlock new areas and even new islands. Some are deserted islands, some are tiny islands with mysterious pasts, you may even come upon a Kraken. Maybe build a colony, a whole civilization in the rim of the world, but most of all, survive and complete the quests.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy adventure games, survival games or even board games, this is definitely a game worth giving a go. It's a real treasure.\r\n\r\n☠ WARNING! No wifi on the island.

When the island <strong>SPEAKS</strong> to you, will you answer?<br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong>:<br>➾ Lead a band of island survivors using simple swipes<br>➾ Choose your own adventure and try to survive<br>➾ Explore a huge lush world<br>➾ Experience a talking island<br>➾ Fight many dangers that lurk behind every bush<br>➾ Forage resources to survive<br>➾ Build a base and upgrade structures<br>➾ Match, stack and collect flowers in a cool mini game<br>➾ Craft weapons and tools<br>➾ Discover a gripping storyline<br>➾ Uncover the terrible secret of Tinker Island<br><br>Three survivors find themselves shipwrecked and lost, not by choice, on what is believed to be a tropical deserted island. As they start exploring and discovering Tinker Island, they find great treasures, forage resources, build buildings and items that they need to gather, craft, build or harvest to protect themselves against the unfamiliar environment and the dangerous episodes awaiting them. A normal guy, a tourist onboard a ship, is forced to become a forager, a fighter, a true hero in this mini world adventure game. Find mysterious ancient villages and buildings, left behind by either wayward settlers or scum, discover an unknown civilization, uncover steampunk contraptions, covered with rust and almost unidentifiable. Not only is there no wifi in the caves on the islands, the whole thing is nowifi. <br><br>As you progress and craft the needed tools, you slowly uncover the map, the monument, valley, the stars, the mountain and the treasures of the islands.

There is plenty of wit and humor in the narrative, where you have to make the correct choices to progress through the story. Gather the needed resources to upgrade your buildings and unlock new areas and even new islands. Some are deserted islands, some are tiny islands with mysterious pasts, you may even come upon a Kraken. Maybe build a colony, a whole civilization in the rim of the world, but most of all, survive and complete the quests.<br><br>If you enjoy adventure games, survival games or even board games, this is definitely a game worth giving a go.

            "I couldn't get past the menu. I tried restarting the app a few times and it still wouldn't work. When the logbook menu loaded, the screen started flickering like crazy. If I was epileptic I probably would've had a seizure. The game keeps crashing, even on my other device. It's been nearly 2 hrs and I still cant play. But game looks good, so I'll rate it 3 stars at least.",
            "This game is a great resource/idle type game. The ads aren't intrusive, the art design and sound are great. This is a perfect pick up and play type of game, with the random events and nicely tuned progression more than making up for the relative lack gameplay. The in-app purchases are fairly done as well, never feeling like you're being forced into them, but also being a great way to boost impatient players. Definitely give this game a try!",
            "This is a fun little time burner and the aesthethic is charming. Gameplay is cathartic when things are made. The character are unique and give a retro feel. However this game is a bit lacking in depth, logic, and personality. For starters the equipment system is a bit rubbish, when a character get's something new, the old piece is lost to the void. It's a bit counterintuitive when survivor's can't be wasteful. It would make more sense if the old tool broke and the option to make a new one.",

            "Needs work and less ads.",
            "This game was something that I randomly stumbled upon while looking for an entirely different app. It stuck out to me for a very important reason, though... I DJ a Happy Hardcore / DnB fusion for fun and at parties, and I absolutely love raves / raving!!! &lt;3  This game is extremely simple in concept, but is surprisingly difficult in practise. I would not make it through more than two seconds of this rolling and probably be very upset the music stopped. The music goes very well with the levels. This would be immediately followed by me forgetting what in the world i was even doing in the first place, which would then be followed by me hugging everyone in the room, which would then lead to me telling everyone how I was happy and loved everything.  The ads are plentiful, but are placed / used in a logical fashion. There is one ad between / before levels, and you are able to earn five continues for every ad watched. If ads are not to your liking, the creator has provided a no ads option that you may purchase for a very small, one time payment. I felt the game was worth paying this small fee =)  Improvements? Two things. First of all, that bright, white strobe flash is more distracting than cool looking. It has 'killed' me on numerous occasions and doesn't really look all that interesting. Any way to allow view of the level when the flash happens would be acceptable if removing the flash is not viable. My second suggestion is to add lives. I don't like that you immediately lose if you touch the barrier a single time. I get that there's checkpoints, but with the instant lose mechanic, you wind up hearing a certain section of these songs over and over until it gets old. These are my personal suggestions, of course, and other players may feel differently.  If you like EDM, raves, addictive games, and / or MDMA, I'd recommend getting this game!! ~Julia"

Yes, it’s possible!\r\n\r\nDownload the free InTakt app on your phone and choose from the examples of tinnitus there which one is your “nasty companion”. Sign up, pay the monthly fee and you will be armed with a valuable weapon to fight Tinnitus or another annoying issue in your life.\r\nFor Tinnitus, click on one of the sound to which your tinnitus belongs and you are automatically choosing which kind of binaural beats composed by the Maestro will be your music therapy. In the first three weeks, you will notice the difference!\r\n\r\nDuration of therapy\r\nThe treatment lasts for 12 months. During this period you will hear 12 pieces of music with different binaural beats.

You can customize every parameter individually or just the desidered state of mind. Use with headphones only!\r\n\r\nWARNING: If you currently have or previously had epilepsy/seizures or heart problems, DO NOT use the Binaural Beats feature! \r\nCombinations:\r\nCombinations are a new way to experience color and music together, trying to recreate exciting natural wonder and memories with your device! \r\nFollowing combinations are included:\r\n* Candle (candle effect with a nice background sound)\r\n* Dawn (recreate the dawn color sequence)\r\n* Sunset (recreate the sunset color sequence)\r\n* Thunderstorm (Lightning effect generated using the flash of your camera)\r\n* Fire (recreate the fireplace effect)\r\n* Ocean (brings you at the beach)\r\n* Old-Television (constant white-noising with old television noise)\r\n* Forest (recreate the jungle color sequence)\r\n* Fireworks (sparkling colors)\r\n\r\nRelax Lamp includes:\r\n* User-defined variable transition speed between colors\r\n* Color-picker (starting color)\r\n* Adaptive Brightness\r\n* Auto-closing timer\r\n* Various sounds to choose from via Sounds selection\r\n\r\nSome technical specs:\r\nThe color generation algorithm uses the phases between the RGB components, which we express as sinusoidal curves. This allows Relax Lamp to reproduce a fluid and unique color sequence depending on the starting color you choose.\r\n\r\nThe “Adaptive Brightness” is a unique feature (still in its experimental phase) designed to compensate for different eye sensitivities to certain colors during low-light conditions (scotopic vision). We tried to eliminate the misleading feeling that for some colors, the perceived intensity is far greater compared to others. This lets you enjoy a smoother color experience.\r\n\r\nTested on following devices:\r\n- Samsung Galaxy S3 (Android 4.0)\r\n- HTC Desire (Android 2.2)\r\n- HTC Desire S (Android 2.2)\r\n- HTC Sensation (Android 2.3)\r\n- Asus Eee Pad Transformer (Android 4.0.3)\r\n- Asus Galaxy Tab 2 (Android 4.0)\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Internet connection is only used to submit an error report should the application crash unexpectedly. The application does NOT rely on an internet connection in order to work.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any problems, rather than simply rate the app with one star, please let us know what’s wrong using the support link.

            "I love this app! I use chromecast everyday all day. Needless to say i have many free tv apps on my phone. Omg i woke up to a jumpy skippy shadowy burned screen.. This was a 200 ph. LGstylo5. I downloaded this let it go bout 30 min with no hopes of it really working! BUT IT REALLY FIXED MY PH. I was very skeptical. I say give it a try b4 u give up on your phone. Especially if you cannot afford a new ph. Screen Burn Fixer 5Starz",
            "Feel obliged to write a review since this app fully removed my burn in. I had left my OnePlus 7 pro (AMOLED screen) in android auto mode on full brightness for at least 7 hours, meaning that the icons at the bottom and top of the app had burned in. I downloaded this and (after a 2 hour run not working) left it running at full brightness all night (8hrs) and woke up the next morning to a warm phone with a burn in free screen. What a relief!",
            "unbelieveable🙊 I had a major screen burn after playing COD for too long, I was shocked when I've seen it first... I looked it up and so I found this app, let it run for 30 mins and it all was gone! THANK YOU SO MUCH! p.s.: it is kind of a hamster disco, but as long as it works, I'm happy 😉✌🏽",
            "This App is great. I am currently restoring a Motorola Moto Z2 Play; and when I got to the screen burn, I didn't know what to do; so I found this app, and downloaded it. When I tried it, I let it run for several hours because of the severity of the burn; lo and behold, this app really did its job. Although it didn't entitely fix the burn, it made the burn merely noticeable. Great App, and congratulations on an app well made.",
            "This app is very good.I do't know why this app has 3 stars🤷. If you want to fix your phone's display download this app."

Ketones themselves are produced when the body burns fat, and they're primarily used as an alternative fuel source when glucose isn't available. When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain.
