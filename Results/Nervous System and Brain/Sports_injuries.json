Or at least make the time for more than 200seconds or don't put a time limit at all",
            "Why is the there a time limit? The buttons on the keyboard never click or tyoe once you press them and the instruments used never actually finish the job so its just time wasted. It seem like a good game but incouldnt even pass level one bc of the instruments they never did the job even if i did what it told me too. I do not recommend this game to anyome with bad phones with a weird touch screen issue and to anyone who is impatient bc this game takes a lot of time just to write in the patient.",
            "Took me a while to figure out how too use the tools to help the patients. I finally found out though so, all good! Fun game if you like a chalange. ( They put you on a timer... to see if you will go fast enough to beat it ) So Again, it challenges you.",
            "the thing that I don't like about the game is that It doesn't give us enough time to write the info and sometimes when I try to typ a lettr it choosers a random one. I rate it 3 stars. needs some improvements",
            "Very poor game when i started surgery it had be hanging the game so i suggest who had made this game have check its problems"

        "description": "Have you had an ACL injury or surgery, a Knee Replacement or a Hip Replacement? This App, developed by a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience, will help you reduce pain, motivate you to do your daily exercises, and keep you engaged with your recovery.\r\n \r\nCurovate provides daily video guided physical therapy exercises based on the best knee and hip surgery rehabilitation protocols and guidelines. The exercises within Curovate are based on the best evidence, as well as the clinical experience of a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience.\r\n \r\nCurovate can measure your knee or hip joint movements (i.e, range of motion), at home with no special equipment. Curovate requires nothing more than your phone to give you an accurate range of motion measurement in a few seconds - watch the video to see how simple it is! The app also provides progress tracking for every repetition and set of exercise that you complete, shows you your achievements daily, weekly and monthly, and rewards you with badges for your hard work.\r\n \r\nThe ultimate goal of knee and hip surgery is to return to the sports and physical activity you love and to get back to your normal life and Curovate can help you achieve these goals.\r\n \r\nACL Injury or Surgery - Curovate can be used by people after an ACL injury by selecting the pre-surgery option in the app, or if not planning to have surgery, by selecting the non-operative ACL option in the app.\r\n \r\nCurovate is a physical therapy app for people who have had a patellar tendon graft or a hamstring tendon graft used to repair their ACL. Many people also have had a cadaver graft, or  a graft taken from a deceased person, or a quadriceps tendon graft. All of the research states that the rehabilitation and exercises that people need to do after a cadaver or quadriceps tendon graft for an ACL repair is the same as a patellar tendon graft rehabilitation protocol.\r\n \r\nTotal Knee Replacement - this is when your entire knee joint is replaced with artificial parts. This is done for people who have osteoarthritis in their knee and they are limited by pain and inability to do their daily activities. If this is you, then Curovate can help.\r\n \r\nCurovate provides specific daily and weekly physical therapy exercises to help you recover. You can also measure the exact angle or range of motion of your new knee joint to make sure you are meeting your goals and staying on track for your recovery. The joint replacement of your knee is just the first important step to achieving pain free function of your knee. Now it is crucial that you continue daily exercises to get stronger after surgery. You can do this by starting your knee replacement rehab at home.\r\n \r\nThe exercises in the app were developed from rehabilitation guidelines and knee replacement protocols all clearly referenced in the app and 20 years of clinical experience from a physical therapist. Tracking your exercise repetitions, sets and your overall progress is also done by the app so you don’t have to track your daily recovery on paper. If you have questions about if this app can help you after surgery, please email the physical therapist and CEO of Curovate, Nirtal Shah at nirtal@curovate.com\r\n \r\nTotal Hip Replacement - the main purpose of the surgery is to eliminate the pain that people feel from osteoarthritis of the hip joint. The hip surgery was the first and very important step to restoring hip joint movement, reducing hip pain and allowing you to return to your physically active self. However, there is a great deal of rehabilitation and recovery that has to happen after your hip replacement.  If you have had this surgery, Curovate can help you recover. There are daily exercises, important things that you have to do to get better, instructions from your surgeon of what positions to avoid and all of this  information can be very overwhelming and confusing. Curovate simplifies the process of rehabilitation and provides you with daily guidance directly on your phone.",

        "description": "Fitivity gets you better. Looks like you’re here to get your knee better. \r\n\r\nComplete app to rehab your knee to full health. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many knee injuries that can set you back months and even years if you do not take care of it correctly! This program focuses on rehabilitating your knee using proven flexibility and strength training exercises.\r\n\r\nThe workouts in this program will focus on your quadriceps, hamstrings, and thigh muscles and are usually limited to a specific range of motion. These routines will help you increase your range of motion while also focusing on knee stability and strength building. \r\n\r\nThe specific training and functional exercises included in this program are designed to increase strength, endurance, and function of your leg muscles in the quadriceps and hamstrings. This in turn helps support and reduce stress to the knee joint. \r\n\r\nOne of the goals of this type of rehab is building up muscle strength. Having strong leg muscles provides better support for the knee, ensuring that the forces going through the joint are well distributed, which helps reduce the pressure through the joint.

            "I’ve been using Versus for years. It’s the only app I’ve found that lets you compare two teams head to head and really helps with decision making, which is why I love it. Never rated it before but I love the new design and giving this app 5 stars! The only thing I’d like to see that’s not there is maybe pulling in the Vegas lines for comparison on each game. Top quality app though!! Thanks guys!",
            "I finally heard from the developer (after leaving negative feedback.) They wrote that the subscription expired in 3/2019. They claim they can no longer honor my subscription because Google stopped supporting the product. Funny, the new version is on Google, so they are clearly still supporting the App. have many apps. I have bought since about 2005 (I am guessing), they are the only one to not honor the original permanent licence I paid for. This is beyond pathetic!! The need to be removed",
            "Came across this within the last few years & love the ability to simulate matchups including across different levels of college football! I'm always surprised at the level of accuracy! The admin is also extremely helpful & responds quickly! Can't like it enough!",
            "Great app. A ton of stats,predictions and simulations. Has a tremendous website with excellent customer service. The creator of the app, Steve Pugh will personally help you with any issues very quickly.",
            "I paid for this app a while back. It's been redesigned and you now want me to buy it again? I can't use it currently, what the hell? response to developers...maybe give us that information prior, rather than after the fact."

But I want to practice and I don`t want to log in with FB nor with Google nor do I want to be harrassed by anybody especially not by 3rd parties. Think I have to return the products and delete the unusable app to show my dissatisfaction. What do you guys think who we customers are? We are not your data suppliers",
            "I like the app and exercises provided. However, for some reason everytime I switch to this app's window, it turns off my music, even if it's not playing music itself. This is a workout-related app, surely I'd like to listen to my music while doing these exercises?? Also, don't get why the app doesn't allow offline use. I don't think the animation would take that much space on my phone. 2 simple fixes would change the experience of this app. Whoever designed this app, use it at home yourself!!!",

            "This app is great until it's not. Even though I have all notifications turned off I still get notified about everything. And I mean EVERYTHING! On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

            "Like the wide variety of selections. There are a lot of different excercises to choose from and the timer is a great way to keep track. Mobility tests are interesting but it's the same thing; nice if it switched it up every few months. Lately I have been experiencing a weird bug for 22min are actually 15min stretches. The library is the best feature because it shows EVERYTHING!",
            "Fantastic app, really great concept of being able to measure initial mobility and track progress. The daily routine it gives you is programmed to the most weak aspect from your first test. The instructions for each movement are pretty good, I'd probably want a little more detail on some of them. Scaling sometimes just says 'reduce range' which isn't always helpful but the stimulus tab is brilliant for informing what you should be feeling during the movement/stretch.",
            "It was great as a mobility test, but trying to sign up for premium is a hassle, I've tried to subscribe, but it keeps saying invalid card, even though I have a legitimate bank account as well money to pay for it.",
            "So glad I use this app. I've become so much more mobile and the use of the monthly testing keeps me wanting to improve further. Love this app and highly recommend. GET IT NOW! You're seriously missing out on massive improvements",
            "I love this app so much. The Daily Protocol being tailored to your needs is great and I can see the progress im making, physically in the movement itself, and with visually with the percentage rating on the app. I like that the mobility ratings are accumulated in a graph. I think the Pre and Post Wod element is great too as you enter the movements that you're using in your workout and it generates a tailored sequence for you. I can see my squats getting deeper and my overhead ability improving"

There are many other features about the CBS Fantasy app that are not as good as Yahoo. Played in a ESPN League as well and that one too is not as good as Yahoo, but better than CBS in my opinion. I gave it only 1 star mainly because of the cost plus the app features aren't good. If I had to rate Yahoo, I would give it 5 stars. ESPN would get 3 stars.",
            "Super buggy, does not allow you to franchise players from the app in franchise leagues. Lately when I make a lineup change it switches players I never clicked on. This app has seemed more buggy this year then in the past. Needs the ability to do everything in the app that you can on the website. Much easier for phone users without a computer, but I mean who has computers these days?",
            "This app is riddled with problems and bugs. Freezes, delays, incorrect calculations, a black bar that takes over the screen for 15 seconds each time you want to view the gamecast, acting like I don't have an active team when I do, out of sync waiver claims. Honestly one of the worst apps I have to constantly use. It'd be one thing if these were fixed as the season rolls on, but they're ever present and ever changing. For an environment where reliability and stability matters, this is a bad app.",
            "I like the layout of the site, but it's constantly going down. The defense live scoring is always wrong. There are constant bugs. I had my entire watch list wiped clean, and I emailed CBS and never received a response. They never respond to your feedback or even if you report an issue. I don't know why they charge us, as apparently they don't invest the money on fixing their bugs.",
            "Worst fantasy football sports app of any site by far. This year 2020 in particular has been absolutely terrible. It started at the draft which took 3 hrs for a 10-team league because it kept crashing. Its been slow all year, and at times during games, it crashes. Then today, I can't even get on the site. I don't know what they're doing but they need to fix this app ASAP or we will not be back next year after using this site for over 10 years."

            "This was a good app heading for a 5* review. However its not up to date and the favourites are not working anymore. Hearts played Dundee last night in the Scottish Premier League and yet the game is still showing up to be played on Saturday. Update. Reviewed a year ago. No change. Hearts play Dundee Friday night 16 Oct 20. Game showing up on Saturday 17 Oct 20. There are at least 6/7 Hearts players showing up in the team who are no longer there. Developersnever lived up to their word. Out Again!",
            "Try to make my games like flash score so we can see our on going and schedule games in one place for easily, and ads are not supposed to be there so many live score you cant find ads on them, so please make the app to look easier and I swear to God it will be the best app in the world because their so many things on it fewer are not there..thanks..",
            "Quite elaborate and informative unlike some other apps. Meanwhile, registrying and still getting my information back isn't really working. It would have been better if after one registration, when you uninstall and install it back, one wouldn't need to have to register again, as the app should have recognize the phone. Apart from that, the app is awesome.",
            "I was looking for the best possible way to group all my favourite teams from different competitions into 1 app. Here it is. Great app, some of the translations aren't done into English but it doesn't stop you from getting to what you need. Player info, transfer rumours, news, all the games you can imagine, all the competitions you can imagine. Absolute stellar app!",
            "I was a bit sceptical to download but downloading it was the best decision I ever made, every information about matches are all contained in it and are always updated, from live matches, to transfers and everything. But I took out one star because of the pop up ads, they're a little disturbing but asides that, it's the best match app!."

Minus x 2: very often when I tap to open an article, it goes to a completely different article. This happens probably 20% of the time I'm on the app.",

Want to stream something, sure, just get comfy as it buffers every 20 seconds or so whether it's your mobile device or you PC so a college game takes 5 hours, not that you can seen it properly because of pixelated buffering. This doesn't happen in any of my other streaming services, just this. Worldwide leader in sports, dumpster fire of digital media.",
            "Too many bugs. Many articles do not load completely and some just load the first few lines and then nothing but vertical lines. It's a mess! The loading issue was fixed, but now the article links take you to the wrong story. Streaming is ok, but it does drop out too much. Update: loading issues fixed but the links are always messed up. Clicking on a story takes you to a completely different story.",

Tonight I tried to watch a college football game on espn3. It keeps telling me that Im not authorized to watch the stream, which is false, or it can't authentic my provider. This is more than annoying. I pay a subscription for your app and it doesn't even work right have of the time.",
            "Update: October 9. Still buffering for pretty much everything. I just download stuff over night and watch offline. Recently, sound is not synchronized with video. Really hard to believe how bad this app is. Original post: Even with measured 200-300mb download speed, the app buffers repeatedly. I don't know if it is a server side issue or the app itself. However, I can only rate my app experience as average, at best. And, compared to services like Netflix, it is far below average."

The negative side! Some of the permissions seem suspicious. Why does it need to \"Run on Startup\" or \"Receive Data From Internet \". I really hope the app is poorly designed but I'm starting to suspect malicious activity. Until I get more proof, I'll leave my review as it is.",
            "Wow😲😲 this app is great. I used it for like 12 days and i could tie my shoe laces without bending my knees. I wasn't flexible before and i didn't even try to see how much i could bend. But after 12 days of using this app, i finally can recommend it to everyone who isn't flexible and wants to be👏👏 well done",
            "I love this app! The best splits app ever! I am on my 2nd day and nearly nailed my splits! I love the countdown aswell! I love the workouts because when I have finished them, I feel energized and its amazing! So if u want to learn your splits, DOWNLOAD NOW!!",
            "I did these exercises once I was already a bit flexible bit the last part was needed and after this I did my splits I have been trying to do my splits since a long time and I did this today I'm super happy and also there are no ads the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a really heavy app I have 4 apps and 4 pictures so I had to delete this",
            "I've done this practically everyday for about 9 months and I've lost at least 15 pounds and can do splits on both sides... Forget the 30 days though. You'd probably have to work out at least an hour a day instead of 20min to get those results...."

            "Overall its a good game, but it needs more features. I want to see a career mode, make the game longer and more like nba games with 12 minute quarters and please make it to where each team can have 15 players instead of 10. And spread out the scoring, it seems like when the rotation is in place only the starters score, and during the season, make it to where you can turn fatigue off or lesson fatigue because the load management is sad. And btw, we should have individual stats instead of stars.",
            "I LOVE THIS GAME! HOWEVER I have issues with the fact that players with \"Excellent\" durability can fatigue faster than players with \"Bad\" durability. The usage amount of the player should not matter if they have good durability. Also players with 10 shooting and shooting abilities should not go 0/5 from 3 shooting 60%+ shots. Its aggravating",
            "Too simplistic/repetitive. Once you find something that works, it works every time. Defense never changes. In my first championship in my first season, I shot over 91% on Pro difficulty. Too easy. I also received a trade offer after the last game of the season. But since the season was over, I couldn't accept it. And contracts negotiations are terrible. If the player doesn't accept your 1st offer, you lose them forever. Did the developers bother to play their game? Good concept, poorly executed.",
            "It was a nostalgic and enjoyable game. I love the old school vibes it gives off. I love the season aspect to it too but would love to see a \"Myplayer\" game mode where you create and design your personal player and see it fail or succeed through the season.",
            "Honestly a real fun addicting game but the simulating feels broken, I genuinely have one of the best teams and was 11-0 playing and thought I would sim to get to the playoffs faster and I've lost 7 straight? The game is honestly so fun but this is so irritating"

There was no easy way to just respond to my initial review, so here goes: in terms of crashing, nothing specific seems to make it crash other than just using it. As far as LHQ, it won't build lineups, and it cites the \"build rules\" as the issue, but no matter the changes I make in the build rules, it still doesn't work. Desktop version works fine tho",

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "The app data on android is constantly wrong. You can't trust any of it. The only way it works is if you go to the app settings and clear data and clear cache. Then you can load the app and look at one dataset but if you start changing configurations it starts getting messed up. Great concept but the data on the app is completely unreliable making this app useless. For example I am looking at my weekly tight end rankins and mark andrews is 3rd but he's on a bye.",
            "I've had this app for almost 3 years now - I upgraded so that I could include two teams and Now under \"Players\" no individuals are listed in any column - QB, RB, WR, TE, FLX, K, DST, IDP, DL, LB, CB. This was working in years past but is no longer working and I have logged out several times with no change. Can you fix this???",
            "It is an exceptional app and did what it is supposed to without paying anything. Of course it will do more if you spend something but you don't have to. It is a great help for serious fantasy players I think.",

            "Great App, gives a lot of good information. I love that it gives you the consensus of multiple experts. It has crashed on me a couple of times though, but for the most part it's smooth."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",
            "I will say it is good app for those who really want to become cardiologist. I am intrested in these types of activities. I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",

            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

            "This is the best baseball game on android. Unless someone can suggest a better game, I'm sticking with this. It is not hard to adjust to the controls, and you don't even need to spend real money to build your team, so just be patient and keep getting the free 10 gems. Also, learn to work the count, make the opposing pitcher wear himself out. My current team in Master II is a beast, and unbeaten towards the end of the season! If you need a great baseball game on your device, MAKEIT THIS ONE!!",
            "This game is 5 star for lots of reasons. It's got great graphics, great gameplay, and great competition levels. The only reason why I am writing this review though, is to give you some ideas for future updates. The biggest thing that I would love to see in the game is Wild pitches. It would be an amazing add the the game. Also, more celebrating after stuff. Like, when you hit a walk-off or win a league. If all of these things were added, I would have put 6 stars",
            "OK Look. This game is fabulous. Its amazingly fun. Its really great! Try it out!!! But the only problem is that its really hard to get gems to customize your stadium, uniform, or logo. I have still had the same default uniform, stadium, and logo for 1 month now and i play the game every day... Otherwise, its good.",
            "The game was good but I'm not sure if it's getting to higher levels or not but there are way too many line drives caught especially by the 1st & 3rd basemen. It seems like 75% of the outs are line drives and not enough lines drives that are his unless they are doubles. The game isn't enjoyable anymore unfortunately.",
            "I like this game because it's Baseball. But I hate how your players get tired every 2-3 games and you have to give them energy drinks. That happens constantly. Also, I'm ok with losing here and there but there should be no reason that I lost 11 games in a row even though everyone on my team was non injured (I just noticed that today) and everyone is in perfect condition and is not tired. That's absolutely garbage."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "It's a wonderful time killing game, but once you get passed stage 45 the characters you are fighting will double in there health, power etc; when you and your opponent are on even power on all earlier stages. Then stage 45 comes and your opponent is on a power level of 2000 and you are still on power level 800, what are you supposed to do?...and even worse it stays at this unfair disadvantage (basically it needs a ranking system) (Otherwise your only choice is to rage or switch characters)",
            "The game itself is not so bad. Nothing too much to do but a decent time killer. The thing that bothers me is that ea so blatantly attempted this to be a cash grab for them. In-game transactions are not optional, they become more of a necessity. After a few rounds the opponents start coming so overpowerd that it literally becomes impossible to climb to their level without using real money. I am at level 219, my health is 9000 and the opponent i am fighting has a health of 65k. Really ea?",
            "Sad. More EA sadness. Can't move yourself around with a left toggle, it pushes you in automatically. You just spam punch in hopes it lands, randomly tapping an icon on the left side of the screen where you should be able to move, for special attacks...ground and pound is quickest to accumulate abilities on takedowns/grapples. Really its not a good experience at all, for a fighting style about \"control.\" If i wanted to play a tap \"boxing\" game, id play that AND be able to control my character.",
            "Overall, this game is pretty alright. But it gets mundane pretty early on. Graphics aren't that great either. An obvious money grabber from EA. Watch UFC and play the latest games on console, this one just isn't it. Hoping for another developer to come along and revolutionize this franchise, but until then, stay on consoles :)",
            "Could be better if the computer followed the same set of rules as the player, player can NEVER punch the computer fighter out of a special move but the computer can ALWAYS simply punch the player to completely stop any special move, computer can use body hook to stop take down, player cannot, also it is physically impossible to knock someone out by kicking them in the shin"

I enter these online matches to get more virtual currency but when I'm getting logged out I can do that. So basically I'm losing money and can't gain it.",

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "Whenever I open the game this Great apperars: Loading for 3 minutes, after free play no sound comes and lucky wheel has no option to spin also and exit also. You should write “ Enjoy #1 ( 1st worst tennis game in the world). Not capable of getting 1 star also.",

From receiving various type news update regularly, receiving real time match notification with in-depth analysis and cool unique system for a good user experience.",

            "This app used to by fav, cause there are some major issue that i see until now. I dun know th server or what, but sometimes i open the app but all i got is infinite loading.. the issue is not in my connection, cause websurfing n opening youtube or instagram all fine. But it still keep loading, sometimes the time also didnt match, example city vs liv at 3.00, at 3.00 the match is till not in live mode in the app as if its still not the time yet. This still my best sport app but u need to fix it",

I thought, maybe a morning routine, nighttime routine, neck stretch routine etc. 50 should cover all bases. Great! But don't be fooled by the terminology. I paid for premium and there is still only 3 workouts. I can't see any different between free and paid. Did they mean up to 50 extra exercises? Disappointed.",

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "Great game, love the controls and the graphics. However, I don't like the way the matchmaking is working. I always get stronger opponents (generally way more agility or serve than me so I can barely hit the ball) and I'm not willing to put money in this game considering that it must be like that anyway. I would love a PVE mode like tournaments.",
            "It is a fun game but trophies thing is bad, like it locks higher tours if you lose trophies in lower tours. pro pass and purchases are expensive. Nevertheless, there is a need to spend money. Also, the game stucks sometimes in the middle of a match. In addition, sometimes the game does not load on my phone, it reaches to 74% then stucks. If the above are improved, it will be the best tennis game i played.. Improve the this please. Too much frustrating. Thanks",
            "This game totally sucks. At first I loved to play but I noticed constantly that it seems the game cheats so your opponent can win. So balls or superspeed for the other players even though I have great stats. This is a total scam game to get you to pay money. I'm pretty sure it's matching you with boys or the creators so you automatically gonna lose. I'm deleting this game because it is a total lie and scam. This game has made me want to stop trusting game sites. Your all in it for the money.",
            "Really fun. The controls are very easy to learn, and hard to msster. The stats and gear help, but a good player can beat someone with much better gear. So its not P2W. It takes time to open loot bags that you get for winning. And you can watch ads to take 15 mins off. Not bad at all. And no surprise ads either. You only watch if you want to. Would reccomend. If you like pvp, try it. If you like tennis, try it. If you like to waste time. Play it. Only cons are entry fees and upgrade costs.",
            "This game can be very fun. Unfortunately it glitches constantly. Opponent will appear to miss a ball. Then suddenly it is past you. Or you swing, and suddenly it is past you. Or better yet, you never even see a hit or serve, and suddenly your opponent has a point. Sometimes, an opponent who's has nowhere near the skill or agility is all over the court, and hitting zingers. It is really fun when there are no glitches, but extremely frustrating it isn't working right."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "this game would be getting a lot more 5 stars if it wasn't for those damned ads. i got an ad on loading screen on my 1st game. if only the devs weren't so greedy, then it would be a really good fighting game for mobile phone. but on it's current state though, i wouldn't recommend because of the egregious monetisation.",
            "It's all around a decent game but the dodge button and the training buttons for example for speed the hit boxes are too small If you don't hit them dead center it won't register I have lost and almost lost plenty of matches just because the dodge button didn't register",
            "Was good until for some unknown reason in Tournament mode can only use one arm, and even if I win the match using only one arm instead of advancing in the tournament, I go backwards not forward In regular game play both left and right punches can be thrown, what a load of horse sh*@",
            "It seems it doesn't even know simple addition dropping it down from a 2 to a one. Visually pleasing however the fights are really underwhelming. This could be a good game if you try to make it one however it seems that you just dont want to try."

            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard 💪.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

            "A really nice and fun way to pass time! Only wish the balls were more accurate but somehow when you get the hang of it, you know how to throw them. Also, and this has happened more than 3 times, it would say I still have to hit a few more cans but there are no cans left to hit. Please fix this. It's very frustrating esp for the harder levels when you're so close to winning.",
            "There are alot of ads running and is very pathetic.. Its like not playing the game but watching the ads.. As i have downloaded it just to watch the ads. Not Worst but it is more then that..",
            "You guys need to fix the bug I'm on level 91 and everytime I get all the cans down the counter still saying that there are still cans left to knock down and there isn't fix it",
            "Wish games would allow you a bit more play time before requesting a review. So far so good but I'm only on my third level so who knows...",

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

It’s fast, accurate and simple to use. It features secure cloud storage and real time feedback. The Hamstring Elite gives you a unique insight into a player/athlete's hamstring function and allows you to monitor progression and prevent injury occurring.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nAs we know it’s better to be pro-active in preventing an injury rather than re-active which usually leaves us with some of our top players looking on from the side-lines, missing out at the vital stage of the Championship action due to an injury they sustained either before or during the season. This exercise relies, in most cases, on the aid of a second person or unsafe alternatives which results in a minimum 85% non-completion of the program or collateral injury mainly to the knee and lower back. The Hamstring Solo removes the need for a second person to assist. The Hamstring Solo utilises the person’s own body weight, no additional weights or components required. Both hamstring eccentric and concentric exercises can be performed in a safe and optimal position preventing hyper extension of the knee joint, reducing the range of motion and preventing injury to the lower back. The athlete’s feet are allowed to hang freely with no additional strain being incurred. The Hamstring Solo accommodates users of all sizes, heights, weights and levels of fitness with minimal adjustment.\r\n----------\r\nRobbie Lodge, MISCP Physiotherapist for Kilkenny Senior Hurling Team (2001 to 2010):\r\nThe Nordic hamstring exercise is one which every sports person should include in their exercise regime in order to protect against injury and improve performance to their hamstrings. The Hamstring Solo is an excellent and safe exercise aid.\r\n----------\r\nDr. Clare Lodge B.Sc. MSc (Sports Medicine) Chartered Physiotherapist says:\r\nI was delighted to come across the Hamstring Solo as for years, when teaching a patient to perform eccentric Hamstrings you would be instructing them to find a second person to assist or use a piece of furniture that doesn't move! Neither of which is ideal or does anything to motivate the patient therefore compliance is frequently compromised. With the Hamstring Solo, the patient has the independence to perform and comply with the prescribed program. The device also has the versatility to adapt to modify the level of difficulty the Nordic curl can be performed at as well as adapt for tibial leg length with its long platform and adjustable ankle fixator. It is mobile and lightweight so can be transported from clinic to gym / dressing room. As part of the hamstring strength and conditioning regime, I would recommend the Hamstring Solo.  \r\n----------\r\nDr Breandán Long, FRCSI FFSEM specialises in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery and Rotator Cuff:\r\nRehabilitation of the hamstring muscles after an ACL reconstruction is slow and difficult. In fact, non-injured players in general have poor hamstring muscles compared to quadriceps. A lot of players have trouble in exercising the hamstring muscles properly. The Hamstring Solo device is an excellent solution to this problem. It allows the athlete to do Nordic hamstring curls on their own in a controlled way. The device is soundly made and is easy to use. Using it will lead to better hamstring muscle strength.\r\n----------",

            "It's good but stretches are very fast and doesn't give you time to feel the stretch and I dont really like how quick it goes from a laying down stretch to a stretch that may be in the kneeling position or sit up position, you dont get time to do the stretch properly before you have to go back to the laying down stretch and vice versa. It's got potential but could be improved to be more realistic. And it is quite repetitive with focusing on just one side per set time.",
            "This could be improved in several ways: 1. There should be an even focus on stretching both sides instead of just one. 2. The routines are too repetitive. There needs to be more variety. 3. A list of available stretches, as well as being able to see how they're done for practice would be good. 4. The instructor should have a variety of outfits so she doesn't look so dull.",
            "I like the stretches and the voice instruction. This is the nicest looking stretching app I’ve seen so far. Challenges are fun, it’s nice to be able to stretch against a friend. I had issues with verification email but emailed the support and they got me up and running quickly. My only complaint is the ads which can cover top parts of the screen at times after the premium trial expired.",

            "SO good! I got this game not knowing anything about it. And when i started! It was amazing! I got controller compatability wich is really fun and is neat. Overall good graphics and addicting. You dont need to spend money on the game unless you are willing to support the developers. And there is barely any ads! (Besides ad rewards) im new and got some new cars!",
            "Good graphic, good control, best racing game so far. -1 star is the introduce of touchdrive auto drive which takes away players excitement although you have an option to manual steer but it became unfair since others just touchdrive. That's the only down side for this version. Update- uninstalled, seems like there's bug or virus that mess up with my phone. First came out ads issue, then cause my phone can't charge. Nearly goes into store to warranty my phone..",
            "One of the best arcade racer in the market. I'm having fun with this game on smart phone even more than arcade racers on pc. Just remember it's a game that relies on sales to keep it going, so be patient and don't go on a shopping spree without caring, cuz you can get a lot without spending much. And don't spend on any cars from classes higher than the ones from your current career. If you're in chapter 1 or 2, don't throw your money on S class cars. Each thing in is own time.",
            "The game was fine for the first few days but after that the game just crashes whatever I am doing in about 1 minutes time. Gameloft please do something about it or please tell me a way to troubleshoot this. If this wasn't a problem then the game is fantastic PS: I have a new phone and it can't be the problem on my device",
            "Ever since the last update, there's an advertisement that never loads and is just stuck. I can't even hit the back button. I have to close the app and go back in. It happens on my husband's phone as well, so it's not just me. I can't claim packs and use it to skip gas refilling. I just finally started spending my money on this game, and now it's giving me problems. Fix this issue and it'll be 5 stars from me"

            "Excellent game that makes your brain think, but not to the point where it is frustrating. To those complaining about the ads. either turn off your internet/data, or support the developers by purchasing their ad. free offer.",
            "To play without ads, turn off your wifi and data; That being said, I would have given it a 5 as I used to REALLY enjoy this game, but as of today I do not. For whatever reason, it now removes and rearranges the tubes once you have filled a color. I do NOT like this, it is havoc on my brain/eyesight.",
            "Great game. Loads of ads, so you'll need to pay to get rid of them. It is worth the free, however, you still have to watch ads when you get enough percentage to unlock the test tubes. Hence my lower star rating. Surely you should be able to unlock without watching adds when you've paid for no adds? Big downside!",
            "Really nicely done. You'll usually have difficult levels interspaced with a few easy ones, so every time you pick it up you find the game challenging and rewarding, great flow. The sound effects are perfect too. Given the time it often takes to complete a level I don't find the ads too obtrusive either.",
            "Too much irritating by ads, why don't you stop ads displaying on my screen. While I play this game to stop my mobile data button, is it ok for you. Try to imporve your game, I can't suggest to play this game to anyone of my friends & relatives. If in case iam going to suggest this game and they are all facing same problem like what Iam facing problem with this game. They all beàt me very hard. Because this is too much irritating by ads playing between game to game. Can check it or not tell me."

            "It has stopped working properly. If you are exercising outdoors and it has stopped working, even the steps stop being recorded. Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

This game has only one issue and that issue is, whenever anyone requests to play again and I accept the request, nothing happens. The game never starts and stays still. I can't even go back after I accept the request. Also whenever I request to play again, I always see written \"Can't play right now\". I think the issue is on both sides. Solve this issue kindly and I will update my review to 5 stars",
            "Gameplay is much better than previous versions of stick cricket. Ball coming on bat nicely. Better control and timing. But missing offline mode in this game. Want to play upto 20 overs against AI similar to the previous stick cricket games. A button for defensive shot. One for nudge/along the ground shot. Bowling can be made manual by chosing the pitch (pitch points can be limited) and ball speed and type.",

And one more thing you guys had done so much good till far because i had personally been playing this game from last 2 years so i know it very well about your hardwork.",

I took my phone and opened stick cricket live it is showing no internet from yesterday afternoon onwards... but in my phone internet is there..... Pls solve my problem sir 🙏🙏🙏....",
            "Morons created this game to let the senior players to win or players with higher level players. If you are leading against such a player, it'l break your shot timing to give the opponets lead. I have 3200+ trophies & it's my observation. Some players with 2700 trophies have max level players while my max level is still 8. The game is not fair. Who would like to play a game is fixed? Uninstalling it. Real Cricket I'll be playing now."

            "Decent app but instructions are not very clear. Would be good to have video demonstrating the exercise/stretch rather than just text instructions.",
            "Totally awesome app! Absolutely the best I have found. Amazing 3D animations showing each muscle as well as the proper execution of each exercise. It's also very easy to create, modify and track your customized workouts. Good work! The only problem I've had is with the settings feature. When I change the default to 10 reps and 2 sets, it stays at 8 reps and 3 sets. Also, it would be useful to add right/left/both as one of the options for changing. I would prefer the default to be both. Thanks 😀",
            "Excellent app. Would have given 5 star if not for the dated UI. Kindly requesting to update to Material Design",
            "Loved this app previously but now wont open on Honor play device.  it opens then closes immediately.  Uninstalled and try to find on play store and no longer exists, they want £9 for the new version.  Finding it on play store through laptop you can no longer send to device as it says unexpected error has occured.  I'm not paying another £9 for an app that may get updated again and stop working.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

As with other user's, it would open on the 2019 Superbowl, but this wasn't too inconvenient, but as per at least one other user, my app has not updated since the week 5 Bears v Buc's game. Have un and re - installed, unfortunetely still stopped. Thought might be my old, storage over filled, phone, until reading other user's reviews. Hope this can be rectified as i used and enjoyed this regulary.",

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

What it needs to be perfect, is add: 1) better instructions on the video guides. I combined it with other workout apps in order to have better visuals of what to do. 2) the option to partly quick-view the locked exercises 2) how many times a week each program should be done for best results. I only saw that on the 15' cardio - abs one.",

We took our imagination to the next level and created Tipstero Analyser with Artificial Intelligence, a new algorithm based on artificial intelligence designed to analyze all the matches smarter and faster.

We integrated basic criteria and the computer analyzer can predict and estimate the most likely outcomes for the top markets 1x2, double chance, over / under, BTTS / GG. The algorithm calculates all the probabilities and offers the winning percentages based on past statistic data, team form, head to head results, goals scored, goals conceded, odds fluctuation, team profile (attacking or defending), past playing formulas. Although the algorithm has been tested and proved to be a viable long term option if used wisely, you must consider that it can only estimate the percentages for the most likely outcome based on statistic data... the algorithm doesn't have access to all available data like injured players, weather conditions, team motivation or individual player motivation. In conclusion, our artificial intelligence analyzer can help you spear a lot of time by posting the most likely outcomes for all markets, just pass the info you get through your personal filter to get the best of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC FEATURES\r\n\r\n• Estimates and predictions 3 days in advance - accurate daily football betting tips for each match generated with our artificial intelligence algorithm\r\n\r\n• History - past 3 days available (all betting tips included)\r\n\r\n• Prediction Types - 1x2, Double Chance, Over / Under, BTTS / GG\r\n\r\n• Dictionary (betting tips) - all betting tips explained in detail\r\n\r\n• Professional design - friendly and easy to use\r\n\r\n• Push Notification  - with on / off option\r\n\r\n• Customized match hours - according to your phone's time zone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCED FEATURES\r\n\r\n• Win Rate Percentage - a trust indicator used to rank the predictions according to the trust level assigned by the AI Algorithm \r\n\r\n• Full Customization - you can add favorite leagues, expand and collapse leagues visibility and to use the filters to sort matches by leagues or by start hour \r\n\r\n• Auto Bet (Ticket Generator) - The ultimate auto ticket creator that allows you to generate virtual bets with a high probability.

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "REALLY GREAT!!! Iwould give more stars if possible. I need a good PT for my profession so the quality of my training is a question of health (and life) of me and my client. This app is easy to work with, effective and doesn't need 3 hours a day. Stew definitely knows the stuff! Btw: there is more from him (also high quality products.) Thank you Stew for sharing! You will never know how many people you helped...",
            "The information are great as everything from Stew Smith, but the way the daily training is presented and written makes it almost incomprehensible, please use bullets to separate exercises and make it readable. Compare the free week to the other weeks, and you will see the difference. Please fix as the app when fixed would be a great one. I paid $29 to be able to view the workouts and now it seems like lost money!!!!",
            "It is really an AMAZING app . It has many different workouts as compared to another apps . Best app for fitness👍👍👍",
            "It's not necessarily the exercises because you look up what they are. What's REALLY frustrating is that they are poorly written out on the schedule plans. When you want to follow these workouts, you find yourself frustrated at the format and spacing of the words. it may tell you something like 5 sets run 1 miles - repeat Repeat 5 times 5 min scissor kicks it's like what do you want me to repeat?The run or 5 min scissor kicks? Seems lazily typed like this was a quick cash grab.Waste of Money",
            "Bought the first week through the forth and i open it and all it is, is a bunch of workout i never heard of. theres not even any spaces between the workouts. No chart showing the kind if workout. Total waste of 4 bucks."

        "comments": [
            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "Not a bad editing app, pretty easy to navigate. I could've done with the drawing/painting option to have been a bit more specialised but otherwise its not bad.",
            "This is a very good app that will allow you to get whatever job you need done. My only two issues are the few number of fonts, the fact that you can't edit the position of photos after you place them, and also for some reason if you put too many photos often some of them will begin to blur. Very frustrating, but for a mobile photo editing app this is probably the best one you can find without having to pay."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",

I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",

I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "I've redownload this game on different phones over the years and do really enjoy the game. But one issue seems consistent despite the device. Maybe it's because I have little fingers but the movements aren't always accurate and it gets really frustrating when you get to higher speeds. I try to slide over and end up jumping instead. Or flat out don't move at all and go splat into the train I was trying to avoid in the first place. It's fun and a good game but the tolerances need to be better.",
            "I haven't played this game for a very long time, but after reinstalling it again recently, all I can say is... Good job on this masterpiece! Seriously, this game is better than I remember! The only reason I vote it for 4 stars is because there are ads popping up on the home screen. Other than that, keep up the good work! 🙌🏼",
            "Amazing game, one of the \"originals\"- I remember when everyone I knew had this game- and it's continued to develop amazingly! One idea though, would be an option to change the theme, as I, personally, prefer to other themes than the current (Halloween) one. This would be a really nice thing to see added, but still a great game either way! Thank you!",
            "I understand why ads are necessary but what I hate about is the \"UnityAds\" are always crashing my game and it automatically closing the game. \"Google Ads\" are better, it does not crash my game. Still 3 stars for now. Hope you removed all the \"Unity Ads\" in the app. It spoils my experiences in the game. Reported this issue already to your support team. Still waiting for a response. Please? Thank you.",
            "I liked this game very much...✌🏻It's amazing😍👍🏻It's features are also too good 👍🏻✌🏻But one ☝thing I doesn't like is that, that when I am playing my 🎮game the, \"Unity Ads\" Crash/stop 🙅my 🎮game... The other ads like goggle ads are good then unity ads... because they doesn't stop/crash my 🎮game... I hope that you will remove unity ads.. Plz reply about this.... Thank You for reading my post..."

I've done lots of different programs, and except the interruption of music, which I think theyll fix soon, it's been very helpful in learning new moves, and get motivated! Plus, my form has never been better. Good stuff",
            "I've been on the paid program for about 4 months now after completing the initial fitness assessment. The experience feels like a beta with an unpolished, buggy app & repetitive workouts which lack variation. Some of the movements have incorrect descriptions where it's clear the developer has done a copy & paste but not inserted the correct information (like the description for clap pushups on bent knee dips). The workouts also have a habit of missing full muscle groups week on week.",

        "description": "To stay safe and get the most out of your workout you must always include a pre-workout warm-up before you begin and then finish with a cool down to get your body back into gear. \r\n\r\nIf you’re short on time, you may feel tempted to skip a warmup and jump right into your workout. But doing so can increase your risk of injury, and put more strain on your muscles.\r\n\r\nWhen preparing for any kind of exercise, whether it’s a cardio workout, strength training, or a team sport, it’s important to take a few minutes to ease your muscles into exercise mode. Doing so can help you reap many fitness rewards.\r\n\r\nDuring a workout we can all go from zero to hero and push hard but the safe way to train is to bring the body’s temperature up slowly and loosen up the muscles before we get to do anything serious. That’s what warm-ups are designed to do. Stretching, on the other hand, is done in order to improve overall flexibility. Once muscles have worked they are at their most compliant state and they let us stretch further than we normally would gaining more ground while we are at it.\r\n\r\nWarmups are critical to a better performance and fewer injuries but stretching is somewhat of an optional extra, but it is highly recommended. \r\n\r\nIf stretching exercises are part of your workout routine, it's best to do them after the warm-up or cool-down phase, when your muscles are already warm. Done correctly, warming up and cooling down may offer help in reducing your risk of injury and improving your athletic performance.\r\n\r\nWarmups and cool-downs generally involve doing your activity at a slower pace and reduced intensity.\r\nWarming up helps prepare your body for aerobic activity. A warmup gradually revs up your cardiovascular system by raising your body temperature and increasing blood flow to your muscles. Warming up may also help reduce muscle soreness and lessen your risk of injury.\r\n\r\nCooling down after your workout allows for a gradual recovery of preexercise heart rate and blood pressure. Cooling down may be most important for competitive endurance athletes, such as marathoners, because it helps regulate blood flow. Cooling down doesn't appear to help reduce muscle stiffness and soreness after exercise, but more research is needed.\r\n\r\nWarm-ups should always be dynamic, always use active exercises to get our bodies ready. We need to get the blood flowing, especially during colder seasons. Our bodies benefit from stretches after we have already worked out (cool down). Our muscles are more susceptible to them allowing us to stretch further and hold the stretches longer.",

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "The app opens and allows me to fill in my pre-made forms. The problem is I can't 'save as' to a different file name within the app which is stopping me from easily reusing the form. I can't even rename a file within the app! If it doesn't get resolved soon I'll have to stop my subscription. Edit: Also urgently needed is the option to 'flatten' documents so as filled in forms can't be changed by someone else later. Even free apps allow this. Now cancelled my subscription until Adobe sort this.",
            "This is useful for editing PDF files i have to edit. But there is some problems that makes it annoying to use: 1.using Fill and Sign Text sometimes undoes itself for no reason. So you must save alot of times which is annoying. 2 sometimes saving also undoes some text 3 there is no copy and paste (well you can paste but you cannot select a text to copy it.)",
            "Great extension of the powerful desktop application. The PDF ecosystem is mature and well functioning.

You need to think about flexibility too.  \r\n\r\n“Stretching Exercises - Flexibility Training“ app gives you an opportunity to improve and as well as maintain your fitness through flexible movement of your muscles. \r\n\r\nWe assure you easy learning with the best stretching exercise. \r\n\r\nWe also make sure for your choice of compatibility,                                                                        hence why  “Stretching Exercises - Flexibility Training“  is available offline. \r\n \r\nThis app offers you a free stretching workout.  \r\n \r\nUser friendly UI for smooth experience.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy stretching is important\r\n\r\nStretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints.\r\nNowadays stretching exercises play an important role in sports training, during warming up as well as during recovery.\r\nIncreasing flexibility through stretching is one of the basic tenets of physical fitness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of Stretching\r\n\r\nFlexibility\r\nStretching improves flexibility. The more you stretch, the more you move your muscles, and the more flexible you become. Over time, stretching will become easier for your body which results in improved flexibility.\r\nPosture\r\nStretching is also beneficial to improve your posture. Poor posture—a common and increasing problem—can easily be reversed and healed with daily stretching. Because stretching strengthens your muscles and encourages proper alignment, your body posture will be less slouched and more vertical.\r\nInjury Prevention\r\nThe more you prepare your muscles for any exercising movement, the more your likelihood of injury is decreased. When your muscles are warm and stretched, movement becomes easier and more fluid-like which helps with injury prevention.\r\nIncreased Nutrients and Reduced Soreness\r\nMost people know that stretching increases blood supply, but they do not realize that it also increases nutrient supply to muscles. Because stretching allows blood to flow through your body, the nutrients in the blood are being carried and spread out all throughout your body as well. An increased blood and nutrient supply also helps reduce soreness.\r\nIncreases your range of motion\r\nBeing able to move a joint through its full range of motion gives you more freedom of movement. Stretching on a regular basis can help increase your range of motion.\r\nIncreases blood flow to your muscles\r\nPerforming stretches on a regular basis may improve your circulation. Improved circulation increases blood flow to your muscles, which can shorten your recovery time and reduce muscle soreness (also known as delayed onset muscle soreness or DOMS).\r\n\r\nFeatures \r\n- Stretching exercises cover all muscle groups and are suitable for all people, men, women, young and old\r\n- Create your own stretching exercises routines by replacing exercise, adjusting exercise order, etc\r\n- Voice coach with detailed animation and video demonstrations\r\n- 100% FREE! No locked features\r\n- No equipment needed, training at home or anywhere anytime\r\n- Dynamic stretching, stretching exercises for flexibility, warm up exercises, stretching routines, Stretch for runners \r\n- Helpful easy stretching exercise  for better flexibility of muscle. \r\n- User friendly User Interface for seamless experience.",

While it was designed for Hockey and Lacrosse it is great for football and baseball and can be used for any event where music is played between or during play.\r\n\r\nThe application features 10 different playlist buttons for various events during the game such as for a home team goal,  a  good Save,  a visitor penalty or goal, timeout, intermission, home team penalty, instrumental and after the player gets up from an injury.  You can customize the button names for any events you want or to fit any other sport.\r\n\r\nThese buttons make it very easy to play an inspiring song like “Hit Me with Your Best Shot” when your goalie makes a great save or to play the Law and Order theme when the other team takes a penalty.\r\n\r\nPressing the stop button fades the song volume out gradually and automatically cues up a new random song to play.  Many random song functions in other applications play the same song multiple times but Sport DJ will not play the same song within 2 hours unless all the other songs have been played at least once.\r\n\r\nSongs can be set to start in at any point during the song allowing you to skip a song intro or to start the song at a specific set of lyrics.  The songs can be set to fade in at this point in the song so there is no abrupt start to the music.\r\n\r\nChose from multiple styles of goal horns and add it to any song or even multiple songs easily.  Simply select the song and set at what point in the song you would like to start.  The song will fade in at the end of the goal horn.\r\n\r\nMix in a voice file with a song.  This allows a mix of a professional introduction of your team or a sponsor promotion message mixed with music.  Create an introduction with the player’s name, number and position with their own music for walk up music in baseball.\r\n\r\nSport DJ has basic help and even suggestions for what songs are good for each button playlist.\r\n\r\nSport DJ lets anyone do a professional job of playing sporting event music, regardless of if it is your kid’s minor league game or even a professional game.\r\n\r\nTo get a full idea of the capabilities of the app, please check out the how to video on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS3FB6txAhk&t=11s\r\n\r\nPlease note, Sport DJ does not work with streaming music services like Spotify or Google Play Music.  You need to have the music files on your device.  It is easy to get all music inexpensively at www.mp3va.com if you don't already have the songs.",

Many random song functions in other applications play the same song multiple times but Sport DJ will not play the same song within 2 hours unless all the other songs have been played at least once.<br><br>Songs can be set to start in at any point during the song allowing you to skip a song intro or to start the song at a specific set of lyrics.  The songs can be set to fade in at this point in the song so there is no abrupt start to the music.<br><br>Chose from multiple styles of goal horns and add it to any song or even multiple songs easily.  Simply select the song and set at what point in the song you would like to start.  The song will fade in at the end of the goal horn.<br><br>Mix in a voice file with a song.  This allows a mix of a professional introduction of your team or a sponsor promotion message mixed with music.  Create an introduction with the player’s name, number and position with their own music for walk up music in baseball.<br><br>Sport DJ has basic help and even suggestions for what songs are good for each button playlist.<br><br>Sport DJ lets anyone do a professional job of playing sporting event music, regardless of if it is your kid’s minor league game or even a professional game.<br><br>To get a full idea of the capabilities of the app, please check out the how to video on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS3FB6txAhk&amp;t=11s<br><br>Please note, Sport DJ does not work with streaming music services like Spotify or Google Play Music.  You need to have the music files on your device.  It is easy to get all music inexpensively at www.mp3va.com if you don&#39;t already have the songs.",

            "Liking the app so far. Wish it was a bit more polished but over all its great. one question though. Running on android, can i transfer a whole profile and assigned songs from one device to another device to have the identical set up 9n both devices?",
            "Easy to use! Makes our hockey games fun! The only thing that would make this a better app is having more buttons to program.",
            "Great app. Would've given it a 5 star if their was spotify integration and more pre-loaded sounds and efx.",
            "Ok. Let me be very clear. I was going to design an app just like this for myself. Something told me, why not see if there is one available first? Sure glad I did. Best $7 I have ever spent. Did a test run with limited music within hours of downloading. People were impressed! I look forward to working with the developer to make this app even better. 5+ Stars.",
            "App does everything it advertises. It makes running entertainment at games seamless (and brainless). I've had many comments from spectators about how great the music is. Yet, all I did was press a button labeled with the activity that just occured on the ice. Lots of websites provide song ideas for penalties, goals, saves, etc. Just build playlists and go. Even has built in goal horns. Easy set up. Easy use. Functionally customizable. Great features. Fantastic support. Running on Samsung S8."

            "Loved the game for a long time, for years.. Love the graphics and all. Compared to other racing games its way better. My issue is that eveything is all about money now, you gotta pay to advance. It wasn't the case before. There were some in game purchases before but nothing like it is now. What made it enjoyable, and what makes me want to always play, is that I may not purchase everything to get ahead. I just wish it was like it was before...",
            "I love the graphics and all the different modes that there are...really good game...tho I would put the multipling earnings with ads...that can give users the option of doubling the credits or the same amount of fusion coins... example: you got 1000 credits on a race...you get the option of multipling them, so you get 10,000(1,000x)...soo that we also have the option of instead of only double earning credits... Also fusion coins...buy we get the same amount we would get if it was normal credits.",
            "Very disappointed! I thought the latest update was the best update since they have included the high frame rate settings on my ASUS Max Pro M2. The game was very smooth at 60fps and I didn't encounter problems or glitches. But after I opened the game again the settings for high frame rate was gone. The cost of upgrades is already so expensive, at least give us a chance to enjoy the game @ 60fps.",
            "I don't think making a comment is going to change anything, but I will go ahead and vent a bit. This game is fun, but super expensive. Like, all the cars in S class cost tokens all of a sudden. What happened to plain old credits? Sure, the prices were exorbitant, but there was some silver of hope. With these ridiculous token prices, how are those of us who cannot/do not pay to play make any progress? And how does one even go about earning a decent amount of tokens? Honestly.",
            "Latest update reduces value of original currency to ZERO. You spend all this time earning it, now it's worth NOTHING. It has been replaced with a currency introduced a few updates ago. AVOID AT ALL COST!!! The game is decent. It's just Gameloft that SUCKS!!!! If Gameloft makes the game, find a different one. It will be better in the end!!"

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

            "There's actually a lot of educational and helpful people on this app from all different backgrounds and it's actually incredible to be able to learn from them. It can also just be fun and silly. It all depends on what you're looking for. I only have one real complaint and it's that I wish you had more characters to write a comment with. I'm an extremely long winded person and the limit makes it feel difficult to communicate efficiently for me. I haven't had the app for very long though. 🤷🏾‍♀",
            "This app is amazing !!! It keeps you very entertained and you can spend hours on it without being bored , but there are lots of problems , minor problems and big problems. A big problem for example would be Tik Tok deleting random videos which really annoys me , some of my favourite videos have been deleted for no reason , and another huge issue is the community , the people in the comments always say mean stuff to the creators of that video and it really bugs me because I feel so bad for them.",
            "I really enjoy the app, very much, but there are a couple/few of things I would love to see updated: *1. Make it possible to edit a video after posting (too many times I have made a last minute change, which (for whatever reason) changed the placement of an embedded text. SO IRRITATING); *2. While in the editing process, make it so the timing duration doesn't disappear; *3. Disclose how one can become \"verified\" (this actually may be in the app somewhere, but I haven't been able to locate it);",
            "I love tiktok. But sometimes the app freezes and its sorta annoying. And why should we have to link our phone number? I can't text like that. And we should be able to have multiple accounts with the same phone number. I know that could be dangerous but you could notify the other account(s) with the same number to see if it is the same person. And until this is fixed I will rate one less star every month.",
            "I like TikTok a lot and it is very addictive - I've found a lot of pages I really like, thanks to the excellent algorithm. However, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) It'd be nice if there were a setting that allowed you to have the video either be paused or muted when you first open the app , so it wouldn't just start playing out loud in public when you don't want it to. 2) It'd be great if you could make an auto-scroll feature so you could do other things while watching videos."

        "description": "Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out, but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded fitness routine as strength and cardio work. Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe. Stretching is important, yet often most neglected part of the fitness. Not only while working out, but you should also include stretching and flexibility exercises into your daily routine. Avoiding stretching may result in increased soreness and fatigue. \r\n\r\nA full-body stretching routine can help you unfold and improve body alignment. Stretching a muscle temporarily relaxes it and allows it to lengthen. Common logic dictates that a good stretching routine paired with an appropriate warm up and cool down before and after activity and can be an effective way to prevent injuries. For a full body routine from head to toe, roll out a yoga mat and try these stretches.\r\n\r\nHow to Become More Flexible - Best Stretches for Flexibility\r\nWe've listed the best stretches to alleviate pain and increase your flexibility and range of motion. These stretches will also help avoid injury during cardio or strength workouts. Gently lean into each position and observe which ones feel particularly challenging.  Flexibility plays a more important role in our well-being than we may realize. Experts believe that good flexibility helps you to achieve better results in your training, increases mobility and muscle coordination, reduces muscle pain, and prevents injuries.\r\n\r\nStretching may help you:\r\n- Improve your joint range of motion\r\n- Improve your athletic performance\r\n- Decrease your risk of injury\r\n\r\nThe Daily Stretching Routine\r\nWe added the best stretches for beginners for warm-up, cooldown, and everyday flexibility. Flexibility is related to muscle tension and length, and it’s a component of mobility, which is the degree to which you can move a joint through its full range of motion. By incorporating a stretching program into your daily routine, you can increase your flexibility and range of motion. You can also improve performance in sports and daily tasks. Stretching can help prevent injury and decrease pain associated with muscle tightness.",

            "this is a very well rounded app focusing in on a particular goal. the top critical review for this app, you can tell, comes from someone with no experience in fitness health. the fact that this app incorporates warming up your muscles for stretching allows for a deeper and safer stretch than trying to stretch a cold muscle. You would be holding yourself back and it would take much longer to attain the goal stretching cold muscles.",
            "This app is the best app for getting splits! I'm 20 and I couldn't touch my toes I worked with this and now after 3 month I can do the splits and it was totally free!if you wanna do the splits this is the best app and be ready cuz its gonna hurt alot but you can do it like I did!thanks for your great app the only reason I gave 4 stars is that there is no description about moves and no injury prevention part.i wish you had some thing for over splits! This was awesome",
            "The full body stretch challenge doesn't work and I paid for it thats why I'm giving this app one star. I even tried deleting and redownloading and it still doesn't work. Faulty app that takes your money.",
            "can't use it. the app keeps timing out. my phone keeps timing out. woul love to use it... it looks good but it doesn't stay on for me to use it. I'm using a Galaxy Note 9.",
            "This app is so good, no ad and it's free. I had a tight hamstring but it feels better, it was painful but it was worth it, thanks for this great App 😘"

            "Hello Azur Interactive Games Limited! I really enjoy the game! Specially for the graphics and the controls but here's the thing that needs to be added in this game: 1.missions: the player can get credits after completing some missions. 2.improved reward:the reward that player get from the battle is to little. Something that's need to fix: Sometimes When i attacking the enemy the enemy is freeze and no matter i shoot or crash, the enemy didn't take any damage which is pretty annoying.",
            "Wow this game is actually nice. The graphics are superb but can you guys add the custom graphic settings? i want to turn off the shadows completely etc so i can gain more fps in game. It is benefit not just for me but for the other players too. Another thing that you can add is more gamemodes to play like Survival or PVE/Co-Op Modes. Currently the two modes are fine but it can get pretty bored at some time. Add more planes (not pay by real money one kinda plane)and more maps. Good game so far.",
            "4 stars because I want someday to give it 5, when there's missions, when I can play with friends, when there's voice chat ingame. But so far the most realistic air game, except for the real special features of every airplane",
            "Ok..great game love the graphics and realistic fight. But it does need better throttle controls..more planes( f-86 super saber?? Mig 15?? All machine gun battles no missiles map perhaps?? I And i bought a mig-21(45,00) and upgraded it and o t disapeared?? Why?? My other 4 planes are there??? Dont want to spend real money if i lose jets. Where is a place to report errors??? Please help. You want me to uninstall this game and re install.. Will i get all my planes back?",
            "Its a great game. But think you guys should give a little more insight on how to set your aircraft up and buying aircraft. I accidently bought two of the same planes cause i wasnt sure of what was going on. All in all great game. Still miss War Wings though. Something about the old WWII Aircraft."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "I wish the 'challenges won' list didn't pop up every time a challenge was won. It makes it difficult to play the game when it just randomly comes out of nowhere. I wish there was a separate tab that you could just go to and claim the rewards later. But other than that, I really like the game.",
            "This is a nice game to pkay yes it have lots of ads popping up but you can take off the ads by click the gear that's the settung button and you're gonna see remove all ads or remove ads just click it. Okay but I'm not gonna do that they must put ads on it for a reason. Maybe they do that so you don't have to pay real money. This game is awesome you can even buy different tools to chop and greater the pepper,tomato🍅,carrots🥕etc.",
            "The game deserves more than my 2 stars, but because you have to put up with so many ads it's only getting 2 stars. The game shows you ads and then has the nerve to ask if you want to see an ad for a reward, I most likely would if you hadn't just forced one on me already and for you know it alls talking about just choose no ads, I'll kindly except your debit/credit info to pay for it: I downloaded this game for free and it seemed like a stress less game, but all ads\"the freaking is stress back\"",
            "Good game, yes there's a lot of Ads, but putting your phone in aeroplane mode stops them. I feel its a bit boring after a few levels as its very repetitive. But it helps with Anxiety in my opinion. Enjoy 😊"

        "comments": [
            "I loved these varied and exceptionally challenging math puzzles. The hints provided were helpful, but were not so obvious as to give away the answer without serious thought. You really have to think outside the box; nonlinear thought is required to figure out the underlying pattern. Once you identify the pattern, it is then straightforward to solve the puzzle.",
            "Enjoyable and a bit challenging at times. There were a couple of problems that weren't clear how you were supposed to know to use a certain number as a reference. The clearest form of this was on one of the questions, the hint was \" - 40\". I dont know how I was supposed to know to subtract each answer from 40. It just seemed like an arbitrary number that you had to use the hint to know. Other than those questions, which there were only a few, I really enjoyed using this app.",
            "Good for getting basic math practice in from what I am able to play. Unfortunately I am stuck on a level that requires multiple entries and will not allow multiple entries. I had the right answer, but could not enter it. Very frustrating. Maybe a quick tutorial on the various ways you may have to enter answers would fix this. I probably could figure it out if it isn't a bug, but there are millions of games out there. This just turned me off. Next!",
            "Made me recall the simple rules like pemdas, also adding some \"additional\" rules to solve levels as they progress; many answers based on correlation of number sets. Being dyslexic, this game is/was very empowering for me, as I started out sailing through without having to write anything down to solve any of the puzzles. However, after I got stuck on level 58 (by coincidence) my shrink lowered my adderall dose and now I can't make it past level 30 without working the problems on paper. :(",
            "Some of the puzzles are pretty difficult, but none are too difficult that they can't be completed with a little math knowledge and a bit of outside-the-box thinking. Overall, I enjoyed this app, and completing it is a good brain exercise. Some of the puzzles don't actually require math to solve, which annoyed me at first, but after doing a few I thought it was good to force my brain to think more outside the box than just simply looking for a mathematical pattern. Pretty darn good app."

            "The best 👍💯🥰🥰😍😍😍😘😘lot of support from me. Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent 😋 and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever. And BTW Name's SIZZLE 13 years old 😁 ❤❤❤❤❤",
            "If I said thanks then this is not enough and it will never be enough. By all means, this app is remarkable and so useful. Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

            "Sleep tracker: begins recording \"sleep\" while I'm still awake. Would be nice to have a manual override, or clear instructions on how to set a preferred time. Graph line is difficult to decipher; any possibilities on variations, like the watch faces? Something more clear to read? A report of 8hrs 34mn sleep, does match the actual 6hrs 20 minutes I was actually in my bed... Kind of a big problem for accuracy.",
            "It's decent, but it really lacks in the customization for the watch itself. For example, I believe the Quick View settings are for notifications. Being able to adjust the font size and the duration they remain visible would be great, but is absent. Also it seems to disregard repeated notifications (won't show them if they ever repeat). This is a problem if you are using this for a security system that might ping you when a door has been opened.",
            "It has huge potentials but it seems they're not working on this App to improve. Connected to Crossbeats or some more devices but Several Data is not precision neither in-depth. Still they've not released the Beta. This App needs regular updations and patches. Android App is not connecting with Google Fit. Imagine this App doesn't share the data with Google Fit. Not at all a worth Apps to come with a smart watch worth Rs5K or more. This App is killing the Devices with its potential.",
            "So much potential, but some flaws and the watches need work. The sleep timer keeps turning off between 8-9 am despite the fact I go to bed around 3-4 and get up later. The continuous HR monitoring needs work too. The app is really clean and nice though. The sleep graph is the nicest I have seen, but the HR needs work. I really wish the phones that use it were better, they seem to be highly inaccurate. Being able to use other phones would be nice too.",
            "The reason for the 3 stars is 1 reason but a big one, it doesn't sync to Google, please can this be made to feed in to Google fit? I'm on a specific health plan that is tracked by consultants using platforms that can feed from Google. I didn't know about that when I bought the watch which I've grown to like. Also so far the app is 5 star on my experience, except the above 1 failing. Please link it in to Google, would much prefer to give 5 stars."

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"
