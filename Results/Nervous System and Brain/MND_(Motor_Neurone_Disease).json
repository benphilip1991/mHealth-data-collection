        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",

Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",
            "I have to say that the moto g9 has some serious camera issues and u guys have to resolve it soon. The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",
            "Just bought the Moto g 5G plus however the app crashes every time when I zoom out the rear camera with ultra-wide and it asks me to restart the camera......is it the problem with the app or the new phone which just opened today",
            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

            "Umm... the graphics are not that realistic as the icon of the game. Controlling the bike is very hard. But overall the game is good but I don't recommend playing it. The concept I find is kinda boring and need more update on this game you must update the graphics . Also add an option for control sensitivity. I think this game is not going too far because if you don't update it even if it has 100 million download you will not get the the rating for the game. that's all I have to say",
            "Just started this motor cycle racing game. I will let you know how I like it after playing for awhile. So far really good. That's All Folks!!! Played first 6 tracks taking 1rst place. But now I do not have control of the bike. I went back to the first bike I started the game with. Ma quale. Still have the same problem? It's as though my phone cuts out and loss of turning ability with it. Sorry. I love the racing game. Reminds me of Moto Racer. Hope you can fix the bug.",
            "It is really good game . In bored watching movies then I think that I open play store I see this game . But I think a game will come 1 hour. So I deleted all games like that. But I installed this game there was only 10 seconds only. I think that it will be more Seconds",
            "The game is very good but it's graphic and controlling is not good. It's controling is very bad.on 100kmph it don't turn. And after modifications bike doesn't performence is not too good. Although the game is good.I suggest everyone to play this game.",

            "This is a great game with stunning graphics and controls. I really love the bike designs. I seemed to notice that if a level is finished with race bonus, you don't seem to be able to go back to that level. This makes the game to end if all levels are finished. Apart from that everything is awesome. If you want to download any bike game, I recommend this for you.",
            "This is a good game that deserves 5 stars, even more than 5 stars. But the only problem is that when one gets to a certain level, it frequently freezes while playing and this is irritating. I uninstalled it and reinstall it after 8 months with another phone; same problem persists. Pls.try to fix this. Thanks.",
            "Great game ! Fantastic graphics, good bikes. The one problem is that I can't play multi-player, but it's OK. And one that you cannot play the next chapter unless you cross the particular level while the level cannot be completed everytime in previous chapter that's why I m giving it 4 stars . The thing I like is that in every chapter there is a boss race in ending.",
            "This game is good but somehow dont let me pass level 12 even though I crossed it so many times and I go on level 13 but when I exit the app and go back there after few hours or refresh it, it makes me come back to level 12 which is annoying and frustrating. Please let me know how to fix that and why doesnt it save my already done levels. Thanks.",
            "I had never seen such a fantastic graphic game in a smartphone before.Hats off to the producers for this extra ordinary game. I will recommend everyone to play this game.But i'm giving 4 stars because the developer got the bikes' level wrong. For example, Ninja H2R is the current fastest bike, but they got a BMW 1000RR infront of the ninja. That doesnt make sense. So i request the producers to make a real-study on the bikes and make some improvement. Only this one got me annoying.."

Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

            "This app is fine, except I feel frustrated by how slowly this app loads and how long it takes the shutter to close. There is a lot of shutter lag. The app description claims this camera app is \"really really fast with zero shutter lag\" but that has not been the case for me. I want to be able to take pictures of my family when funny things happen. By the time this thing decides to wake up and take a picture, the moment is gone. I'm on a moto g5 plus.",
            "A couple days ago, while looking for 2 videos, I noticed that they'd moved from their regular places. I then checked to see if the Date stamp changed too and it did not. Second issue: as I reviewed the details on the videos and then a group of photos, I noticed that the Time stamp was wrong on every single one of them. I reviewed the Date & Time setting on the phone itself and it is set correctly yet photos I know were taken in the morning are timestamped hours later. Nothing online to fix it.",
            "Wow! I've never seen an app get this much negative feedback! I took a few minutes and read several comments and it's quite clear this app is broken. The cameras in these Moto E5's do work but you will need to download a working camera app because once again this app is broken!!! It took me only a couple of minutes to figure it out I wonder what's up with the clowns at Motorola! I'm not a cell phone or software expert I'm just a guy who can read and understands what he has read. Fix your app Moto",
            "App gives camera error every time and does not save photos any longer. UPDATE: Found that having a 64GB micro SD card formatted as internal storage was what was causing the problem. Switched to 32GB and now use it as external and app works. (had been working for nearly three years the other way) Must have been an update to the phone when I wasn't looking. Maybe the E4 was just too good for the price they charged and they had to downgrade the phone. Upgrading review to five stars.",
            "Worked fine for many years. New update makes the app unstable. Frequently crashes on start. Randomly crashes during use. I suppose this is modern software for ya. Fix what ain't broke. Changes nobody asked for including UI - consistency out the window. Push things out the door as fast and cheap as possible - quality out the window. Updates that make an already trivial program require even more fantastically powerful devices to run... Your streaming pixel data to blit to the screen... Come-on!!!"

            "I gave this app 5 star, perhaps for the improvement to the game in betterments of graphics, more sports bikes and motoGP racing characters, make bikes' meter console little realistic. Characters needs to lean more in high speed so that it will looks so much better like a real life. Top speed and the breaks are amazing but the handling needs to improve. I think vehicles are too much on the highway. For me Maps are really good, if include isle of Man tt map this will be the best moto racing game❤️",
            "Fantastic game by all standard. I really enjoy playing the game. Including opponents also makes it more competitive. My only problem is the ads and can't play with other users"

Minus: getting notifications and info on all the stuff I don't like at all (looking at you UFC). Wish I could select what things I don't want to see. Minus x 2: very often when I tap to open an article, it goes to a completely different article. This happens probably 20% of the time I'm on the app.",
            "If you want to read an article it will work...sometimes, or it will just give you an article that it decides you want instead. Want to stream something, sure, just get comfy as it buffers every 20 seconds or so whether it's your mobile device or you PC so a college game takes 5 hours, not that you can seen it properly because of pixelated buffering. This doesn't happen in any of my other streaming services, just this. Worldwide leader in sports, dumpster fire of digital media.",
            "Too many bugs. Many articles do not load completely and some just load the first few lines and then nothing but vertical lines. It's a mess! The loading issue was fixed, but now the article links take you to the wrong story. Streaming is ok, but it does drop out too much. Update: loading issues fixed but the links are always messed up. Clicking on a story takes you to a completely different story.",
            "I have the espn, disney, hulu bundle. Espn app works 10% of the time. I'm constantly trying to log into my provider to watch live TV. Tonight I tried to watch a college football game on espn3. It keeps telling me that Im not authorized to watch the stream, which is false, or it can't authentic my provider. This is more than annoying. I pay a subscription for your app and it doesn't even work right have of the time.",
            "Update: October 9. Still buffering for pretty much everything. I just download stuff over night and watch offline. Recently, sound is not synchronized with video. Really hard to believe how bad this app is. Original post: Even with measured 200-300mb download speed, the app buffers repeatedly. I don't know if it is a server side issue or the app itself. However, I can only rate my app experience as average, at best. And, compared to services like Netflix, it is far below average."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "To be honest, I love this game app and have been playing for years. Have also spent around $100 usd on cue packs. BUT..... upon connecting the game to Facebook I've lost everything. My rating # of 68, vip level 3, all the cues I've bought and won are allllll gone!!! Had the app posted a notice about this. I wouldn't have connected to Facebook.",
            "I have to admit that this is one fo the best billiard game I have played, everything about it tho are cool👌🏻but one problem is there are lots of CHEATERS!!! I had encountered so many cheaters and I did report but looks like the admins and the creator of this game isn't doing anything about these heffers being cheating. We have to play fairly, even if it's just a game but it could cause some to lose interest in the app and uninstall it. Please help solve this🤦🏻‍♀️",
            "Overall the game itself is pretty good but and this is only my opinion just a couple of niggles the way you reset the the position of the cue after every shot it's nearly always facing away from where you want to go. And you're control's for aiming and shooting is shocking trying to line up the shot you think that's it but when you move your hand away the line moves but I'm sure that this could be sorted out by you",
            "Well i thought most people reviewed that it does not have 2d camera view but it does. I just installed it and testing one opponent and it just did fine. From what i have seen so far i will rate this 4 star at the moment because the graphic and game behavour seem good to me for now and as my experience move further then i can then know how to evaluate this game.",
            "Play this game quite a bit. Great way to end the day. Its the better of the pool games that i have tryed. Note to Owner: How about some upgrades? 1. Invite friends to play 9 ball not just 8 only. 2. More emojies these are good = 😲😉😛😫🥺. 3. COOL frames for avatar, maybe animated? Add these 3 things and the game would be WAY superior to the other versions."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

The worst thing is that every time you hit an object or a car, in the old version, they SHOW you funny physics of a player getting broken bones and all that. INSTEAD, THEY REMOVE IT IN THE NEW VERSION. It's better off to leave this game as a old version.",
            "You completely ruined your game, the feel of the bike is off, the new braking system is dumb, and the endless road theme got removed. WHY? I understand adding content to your game but... The old version was so much better. You had different bikers with their own themes, a single endless highway where the more you boost the faster you are, and it gets more and more challenging as you fly passed cars and trucks. The crashing ragdoll too. All gone.",
            "A really awesome game to look back on but this newer version ruined it. They completely removed everything that's good in the game. No more good characters with their own theme, no more post match pictures and art, for some reason they made the controls hard and clunky, and no more Fugitive mode. Everything fun was removed. At this point, this game lost its identity. I would not recommend this \"newer version\" and rather enjoy the older versions.",
            "Im going to have to give this away, and this is why.... the old version was a bit relistic whenever you crash and get run over the more bones you break, i glad you put a new type of gameplay and kept arcade, i really would like if you could maybe add helmets like the old one and maybe let the player buy different types of helmet's, i know the new update got released like a couple weeks ago but the old one really has more memories. The braking is really useful. Sadly even more NCP's cut you off,",
            "When I was a kid , I used to play this game and it was awesome but when I installed the game everything went slow and I don't even see the bike that he's Riding , and I thought this is RIDICULOUS! !!!! . I'm requesting the game developer to improve the game😕😕😕😕"

I have not heard the sound design yet (been playing with volume off) but I hope its the same as before. That is my real only complaint. If you could revert back I would very much enjoy that. just the art design and animations that is. Everthing else is fine. In short, it feels like a downgrade not a revamp or an upgrade. But this is just MY opinion after all.",
            "It's really great to see the miraculous return of Monster Dash again after a decade or so. (The hype is real.) It's a pretty quick paced game that gets straight to the point, and it's also fun at the same time. So overall, it's a pretty noice game! (This is actually the first time I've ever said this much while rating a game. I guess I'm pretty proud of actually have enough courage to accomplish writing this whole text. Woo.)",
            "I really love this game!! So much fun to play. This is the best game, in my opinion, that you guys have made besides Jetpack Joyride! You gotta love Barry Steakfries!! Keep up the great work developers!! I look forward to seeing all the great updates you have in store for the future! This is a definite 5 stars all the way!",
            "Ok I for one would like to say Love, Love, Love this game. I played it a long time ago, I was a bit shocked and happy to see that after all this time ITS BACK! It reminds me of all the great time I played it back then. I have one problem tho. The speed of the game picks up too quickly. I get that you guys want to make the game a bit more challenging the time period is too short can you guys do something about that?! Would you guys consider maybe adding in some boss fights, could be a great Idea!",
            "Controls are slow one moment and fast the other this makes the game unenjoyable. Also I've noticed that all of you at halfbrick have said it's \"back from the dead\". But it feels more like it's back and buried for good. The only real new thing is the expensive costumes and the update in graphics. Please add new weapons that are useful and affordable. Also I believe a change of colour to the spikes on the yeti area because they're hard too see."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

Also, if I am to get so much ads, I might as well go back to TorrDroid as the ads there are fewer and skippable.",

It doesn't works, when i opened the apps i automatically closes and i reinstalled still doesn't work so i had to delete those apps. I did not found this app useful, i wanted to rate 0 stars, but i can't. When you fix this problem i will download this app!!!",

            "Fantastic app! It could use a few more settings so users can tweak everything, and it would be nice to be able to pause the video-in-photo playing for a good screenshot. This is really a great app so far. *** One important problem I see with this app is that when you touch a spot on the screen to lock the focus, there is no way to make it autofocus again. :/ I got this app for the video-in-photo feature combined with the semi-manual focus feature, but the autofocus doesn't quite work right.",
            "WOW .. just WOW !! After years of being frustrated with my Android device cameras, it's popped up in my play pass and I thought well let me give it a try. By FAR the clearest images & filters that you have just right as you're taking the picture without losing your shot. No more twisting and turning and getting cramps in my hands. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ★",
            "I like that it opens up instantly soon as clicked. No annoying whatevers to have to wait for. I will say its better than my fone camera. I have a galaxy flip 2. And I'm very disappointed with this camera. Was expecting better but probably would be better on a fine with better camera. Would like to see more filters, maybe add some fun Snapchat type effects but good job guys..",
            "I am happy with my device camera which is far better than this application with slow motion, time lapse, boomrange, short videos,image and video effects, low light sensor, sony imx sensor, phanaroma, HDR, timer, beauty mode, tilt shift, manual, image stablization, bokeh mode, potrait mode and many more settings available in my device camera i dont think this app has something special to keep this.",
            "It's okay. Trying my Powerdirector app for video editing and it will not accept any files that I use from this app. That was a deal breaker. I had to take each video file and convert it to the proper codec. There is no option in these settings to do that before transferring to a editor. Way too much time consuming just to get a decent video clip for editing. Not worth the time or effort."

I enter these online matches to get more virtual currency but when I'm getting logged out I can do that. So basically I'm losing money and can't gain it.",

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "I'm too old to figure this out.... Need something that lets me use the keyboard to type and then read that out loud. Maybe have a library of phrase I've input.... Communication outside of my computer is too tedious no matter what.",
            "This app has been a life-saver; we use it to support our communications with our child on the autistic spectrum. The app in itself has to be personalized, and it is NOT easy.. It is time-consuming to get the personalized images (although they have an extensive generic image bank) up, as well as the pronunciation you wish on specific names or words. And, it is nearly impossible to transfer a profile between android devices. Yes, the app could be better, and it is a shame there is no more technical support offered for it, but I am giving it five stars because it is free, and it has been a massive help to us. Thanks!",
            "I found this yesterday and have been playing around with it-I have 18 years experience working for children who have execptionalities. This is a wonderful app for anybody who may need a voice at times but do not have professional supports in place yet. My son has found it easy to navigate and loves that I was able to personalize the labels. The only issue I've had so far pertains to rearranging the pictures, they didn't stay where I put them.",
            "Trying numerous augmented communication apps for my daughter and this one was the closest to what she use to have on the ipad when the device died. Awesome app. Very easy to set up, a lot of setting options to customize for the needs of the individual and it does not matter how long she pushes the button, it will say the word. Speech can be a little odd but this app gives you the ability to use other voice apps to change the sound. After trying quite a few, this is the one which fit all my needs. Will be donating money to the developer as soon as I can. Great job and thank you so very much!"

            "A good strategy game, not too mechanically complex and decently challenging. A treat for fans of the series. Most of the negative reviews are people upset about being able to buy things. Look, all free games want your money. But FEH is pretty generous with what you get for free, has no ads, is from a trusted name, and no game mode is behind a pay wall. You can build up a deep bench of heroes and be competitive in PVP modes and never spend a single dollar.",
            "FEH is unfortunately plagued by many issues. If you're like me, and play for the characters you love, you won't have fun. I've spent hundreds of hours (and real money) collecting and upgrading my favorites, just for them to be outclassed by whatever new OP 5* of the week gets released. You have to pull a character 11 times to max out their power, ridiculous. It's all up to luck if you get the characters you want, and even if you do they'll probably suck. Play Three Houses instead.",
            "I love this game, and there is a ton of stuff to do in it. The amount of free orbs (the real money currency) you get seems to be decent. While I have some minor balancing issues with the game, the main reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the limit on inventory. There are 580 characters; why do we only get 300 slots before having to spend orbs? This has not changed since the launch of the game as far as I'm aware. I feel like we should have free slots equal to the # of different units",
            "As someone who spent 2 thousand on this game, i feel qualified to say: I cant believe advanced wars died to this franchise. Power creep. Bloated summoning pool. Terrible features. Predatory mechanics to spend money. If you like this stuff, then this is the game for you. Dont speak to me ever again, intelligent systems. Hit me with a generic automated response and ill hit ya with a KleanYoSelf",
            "Very fun and rewarding. Purchases are not needed for good characters but I do it anyway because the prices are actually reasonable. Edit: I was actually getting a new player new character summon boost I wasn't aware of back then. It is a little hard to get the characters you want without spending money, and sometimes even still so with spending, but if you are a Fire Emblem fan, it is still a very fun, challenging, and rewarding game."

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Dev's team there is a bug: the interface and all the gameplay is so fast that it just not playable anymore. Bugs: 1.Interface is more responsive, simple touch opens up 2-3 options. 2. Not able to play any track, the overall gameplay speed of bike is increased to 10times as of normal gameplay speed. 3. Unable to connect to server error when opening showdown section. Looking forward for the fix soon.",
            "Game's really fun , like the physics of the game , how every bike felt unique in terms how it feels , but i do have a complaint about a bug I am encountering at the moment where my game sort of crashes every time i opened up the map...i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game and logged back in to my account but it still keeps happening...would like to have you try and fix this issue for me , it would be really helpful. Otherwise good game , keep up the good work devs",
            "Played Trials since the 1st one, big fan! :) This one, like all the other Trials games, gets quite hard after a while..But still fun & addicting. Been playing this version for about a year. Theres always more to do/unlock. One downside, there hasnt been any of the different big holiday events for the last several holidays. I was hoping thered be a halloween event this month like last halloween. So sadly the games hayday might be over? Hope devs dont quit this one yet, still has a ton of players.",
            "Love this game but i come out of the bike shop and it says downloading latest content and that's it. Doesnt download. I'm connected to the internet and everything is fine in my end. The game just wont download. It really angers me because I love playing this game. I had it about a year ago and it was great. I re downloaded it and could only do 5 missions and then it says its downloading latest content but doesnt, and I cant play while it's doing that. I can't play the game at all now.",
            "Amazing graphics and ATD. I love everything about the game. And you never get too good of bikes to just breeze through the game. My only problem is that terracotta is made to make you better. As well as make you use timesavers. When you race him at the mill, he uses the only timesaver there. Making it extremely hard."

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

Please add more levels!",

The graphics are good but the game is not too good. I would appreciate if you can adjust this and i will chamge my three stars to five stars.",
            "It's very good, but when I play I just feel I am addict of this game and my headache start. It is some sort of boring also but still nice game. I feel guilty when I download this game.",

Diffrent types of bike to run . When you update this app new bike appear. It is your wish this review is useful or not yes or no",

            "My ability to speak has been deteriorating lately to the point where I often have severe difficulty getting out things I want to say, and this app is extremely promising when I have those episodes! The ability to save phrases especially- that seems exactly like the kind of thing that would be a premium feature, except it isn't! How cool is that?",
            "I already left one review and I am still currently still using this app to communicate with others due to the fact that I am on a ventilator and cannot speak. There are two improvements that would make this perfect: #1 Being able to use it to speak on phone calls would be fantastic because currently having to text my response while the other person speaks and waits for my response via text #2 Being able to label your saved phrases would really be great. Side note: Thank you for the prayers.",
            "Its a wonderful app for making (text to mp3) l liked very much because its very easy to use but has two problem the first small font size for phrases and the second slowness of mp3 and when you save a file by same name for mp3 it delete the old one. if it save the mp3 voices automatically by number 1,2,3,4 ...etc and ability to enlarge my favorites phrases font size it will deserve 5 star (text style enable you to type in big font but save phrase in small size thanks developer for this great app",
            "The overall app is good but there are things which need to be fixed like the realistic voices in each language are very few because others feel like robotic so add more and also when i write a number with a decimal like(32.8) it doesn't pronounce the decimal point it just skips and reads the next letter.Otherwise the app itself is good.Thanks.",
            "This app is very good, but we cannot edit the title of created categories. Also, when we hear spoken text, it sounds very good, but quality of saved audio files is very bad. If there were not these two problems, I would have given five star to your app."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "The app is one of the best apps out there but the update has not been great at all. It does not give you an option of the voice you really prefer to listen to. At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "the best video downloader there is in Google Play 31st October - the release with ad blocker, now this really deserves 10 stars. previously ads popping up from each click was really starting to be annoying. now with minimal ads just before closing, this makes the app Supreme",
            "Any link from any website I choose, it downloads it for 3 minutes, then downloading progress freezes and shows an nonsense error as \"too many errors\"! It's my 8th try and I saw the error everytime. it wasn't like that before, what the hell had happened for app?",
            "Excellent Downloader. But not straightforward and requires setup. So it does takes some getting use to navigating the different methods for downloading and adjusting individual settings (still not 100% proficient myself). Quick Tip: if can't download or fails, open page in desktop mode and try again.",
            "Really nice app. But trying to download files to sd card will make it 70% or even more slower, that is a BIG diffrence, so downloading large files is impossible especially if network gets disrupted it has to be resumed ASAP if not I'll have to start again which cant be over looked with the download rate",
            "This is the app that works. It's free to use, the ads are non intrusive and has more than enough features for everyone. The multi thread support is the reason why everyone needs to use a download manager, it guarantees maximum download speed."

            "I have been a user of this app for over 10 years. I am a huge fan but, while I appreciate your need to create revenue, the addition of ads that play sound before you even get to the ad is simply infuriating, and is leading me to consider uninstalling. I really do not want to do this, but I cannot fathom how you thought this was in any way a good idea. Please remove the ads with sound. Honestly, get rid of this garbage or watch this die. \"We try to limit these ads\" like hell you do. Lip-service",
            "One of my most used apps, one of the only ones that puts a smile on my face (most of the time). The ads arnt too bad, all except the ones that plays music and is animated. Whoever allowed those to pop up and dissables my music or youtube running on the background has a special place in hell for them 🙂🖕",
            "The app functions well, but half the memes are political and not very funny. I would love to use this app, but I am uninstalling it because I don't look at memes to hear endless political views. I think myself and the majority of users want the moderator to accept less political memes and more that are funny to everyone, regardless of their polictical preference. Otherwise, a filter option would be helpful to sort through categories of memes and avoid political ones.",
            "Epic app, except for august 1st, but there is something im not happy with on it, every now and then on gallery it will only show memes from august 1st (on august 1st every meme gets past moderation) and it kinda sucks since august 1st memes usually suck",
            "Was a great app loved it untill recently when the added ads which were easy to pass over untill a few days later when the ads started playing music even when they weren't on screen."

            "The gameplay is good, but for the love of dogs, RANDOM POP UP ADS, WITH SOUND, AFTER EVERY MATCH? SERIOUSLY? Come on BearBit Studios, you're better than this. I know you can fix it by playing with wifi off, but what if i want to stream music while playing? For un online game I'll put up with short ads, as servers cost money to run, bust smashy road has NO online and thus NO SERVERS. this is outrageous.",
            "I play this game a lot, and it is really fun. But i have some suggestions for a future update. 1, the tanks are too fast, 2 the tanks reload speed is also too fast. 3 the car f1 needs something else, like a 5x faster cash, because it dosen't do anything but go fast. 4 please make it so that the cars don't slow down when they are in the grass. I also want to add a new car in the game, it would be a car that when u get arrested, you turn into a cop car and get 5 seconds to get away.",
            "I love this game i absolutley love it the chase speed cars etc is a lot of fun but theres 1 problem. When you get exploded by an oil truck sometimes you get thrown under the map which causes you to fail and i think that should be fixed but other then that 10/10 thank you.",
            "In my personal opinion smashy road wanted is in okay game however I have witnessed a few glitches during the gameplay your probably going to ask what glitches am I discussing about allow me to explain your driving on the road right? then suddenly you crash into a gasoline truck falling threw the map another thing when accidentally bump into one of the bigger police vehicles when you try to back up the car proceeds to go forward eventually you get arrested I do not recommend this game"

If you fix this i will rate 5 stars edit: you fixed it 😁👍 Thank you",
            "The app is now broken. I can only hear the music out of one ear. And I know it's not my headphones, because I tried different games and they worked fine. Edit: ok thank you guys for working so hard on this app to give us the best possible experience!",

I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",
            "The game is all about pay to play. If you try to play it for free, you'll get so far behind that it is ridiculous. The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend £95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend £95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . 👍",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

Before installing the extender the wifi signal in a room above my garage was 0 to 1 bar causing a camera to disconnect but with the extender the signal is now 2 to 3 bars. I think the wifi camera outside the upstairs room and a myq hub should now stay connected. I'll probably add another extender for my back yard to connect a camera for my dogs.",
            "This app no longer supports any of the wifi extenders sold in the stores. They phased out all the current ones and force you to buy new online. My dap-1530 is no longer supported and its brand new. You need to update this app to support last year's model. Ridiculous!",
            "This apps and router is awful. It super slow and takes many tries to configure it out. I just bought it few weeks ago anf i hated it. Im switching back to old router.",
            "Not as powerful as logging directly to the router via ethernet. And you can't change or set the frequency of the router from the app (setting it temporarily to 2.4ghz for an install)",
            "Absolutely frustrating. I followed the setup instructions 16 times before it finally connected on it's own as I was trying to figure out how to get some help from the website. The app would say the device was booting, the device would start blinking and then shut off, and then the app would not be able to find the device. Over and over again. And the FAQs were incredibly unhelpful. I even tried it using the wps button instead of the app and STILL no connection multiple times."

I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "This is by far the best dj app on gplay. You can create your own playlist and auto or manually mix your tracks. You can also use sound effects and samples to spice up your party or personal mixes. This app is perfect for house parties or college hangouts. You also have the option to use advance sound engine which enables pitch, EQ, Vinyl scratch, and sound effects.The only issue i have with it is that all the sound effects are stuck on preset, it wont allow you to add your own sound effects.",

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",

This is what happens when devs continually tweak apps. Why can't we leave well enough alone. And have working apps Works once, then it needs to be Uninstalled then reinstalled. Works great when you use it once, rather bothersome if you want to use it more. Developer's really need to fix what they broke.",

My device info:- Redmi note 8 pro (RAM 6GB/ROM 128GB) MIUI 12 based on Android 10 I hope this issue will be solved by you soon. I'm waiting for the fix",
            "App comms still keeps stopping... When I restart OR request a bridge (if NOT active) usually fixes it... But lately, it's not been helping... Also, could you try to do something about bridge requests... I get the Gatcha is to rule out bots, but lately when I run it, either I can barely make out the code or I get told NO BRIDGES are available by the time I get the correct code entered... Any chance of streamlining bridge rqsts?? TOR s/b the gold standard for VPN apps",
            "Amazing privacy. Works well. Sometimes it force closes, and sometimes it takes a minute to get a reliable bridge connection, but despite that this will cause browsers to run more slowly, I do not mind. It also works great in VPN mode. I can search for something that might otherwise be a question to be asked locally, and it comes up with a completely different location in a different country most of the time.

            "I like this game very much. I finish very few games and it is also one of them. but this game is laging but my phone is 6 GB ram and 17 GB free space. I dont know why this is happening still I close the game 3 or 4 times then it is fixed. I do this like 3 or 4 times daily. But good work in making this game.",
            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",
            "I'm not gonna lie... I love this game... It's satisfying... But some of the levels REALLY test my patience... Sometimes I think there's absolutely no way to solve certain levels... It really ticks me off... There's also a lot of ads... But i'm not as bothered by that..."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "This game is AMAZING dude. I love this game the songs the cars are sooooo cool You should also download it guys. The design of the game is so good. No ads in this game no freezing stuff, well as you can see I rated it 5 stars. My best game ever in the whole world!!!!😃",
            "Changing my review to 5 stars. I had some issues that were addressed. Which I really appreciate!! This is really a fun game!! I wish the freezing bug could be fixed. But they definately care about their customers who play their game!! Thank You!! Just had a suggestion for the weekly event that cost gems to race. The rewards are xp gas and tickets. Why not offer gems for first place winners. I use hundreds of gems in the event. You could offer the gems instead of the tickets. Just my 2 cents.",
            "I love this game! My favorite part about this app is that it always lagging the game to make you crash so then you have to buy more gems! Along with the continuous ads is really perfect for the game! This is definally the best game to spend your money on! Update: Fastlane you can stop making this a pay to win game! That is my suggestion!",
            "loving it also i started getting videos again about 75 percent of them gave me rewards a few of them timed out but im not complaining rewards are great no matter what. Ive bought all drones and have a lot of gold tickets built up with no use. Would like to see some kind of gold exchange for them that would be great.",
            "Very fun, very challenging, fast paced, strengthens hand eye coordination, upgrade prices are reasonable, obtaining resources you need is easy but not too easy, good graphics, good music. Overall a great game"

            "App doesn't provide accurate information. For example whenever I run Battery test, initially the temp shows high (40°c) & after running the test the temp shows 41° to 43°c. I don't know how is that possible 🙆? Also my phone memory was 6GB free but after installing this app(after running Junk file test) it shows only 2GB available. So goodbye to this nonsense app.",

That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

            "I've been on and off with this app for years. It's had so many changes throughout the years but this latest version has got to be the worst. The latest interface is just clunky. The old one was better. Another thing: there was two versions of this app. The original version was this free one. Now it's not free anymore? How is it that you guys are putting a premium on this one when you already made another pro version that you had to pay for? Just keep this one separate and free.",
            "Wow... just wow. Downloaded app a while back, and was pretty good! Unlocked all the fx options by watching videos, and was able to actually use the app.new update comes in, cant do anything but watch ads. Now even the previously free fx effects are now \"premium\", and whenever you click the fx tab, it brings up the subscription page, interrupting your doing. And when you exit THAT add, ANOTHER one comes up! Worst update ever.",
            "This pirch bar is a joke, can barely set the bpm right without using the sync button. You ruined it, the previous one was way better. It's nice that you can apply 2 effects on a track at the same time unlike before the update, but now they're smaller which makes it harder to use with my chunky fingers, i often screw it up because of that. The eq slides were narrowed down, bad idea. The automix button just simply shouldn't exist or place it somewhere else where you can't press it by accident.",
            "Don't even bother updating it, when you try to change the tempo/pitch of the song, its too hard to get it accurately to where you want it to be using the bar, the way it was before was way better and the worst part is they charge you for recording, they'll do everything and anything for money....",
            "I absolutely love love love this app great for beginner djs or just to have fun my only problem is that I cannot record anything I mix through SoundCloud even if I do buy premium. if there is a fix for this I would love to hear about it also would like to see more personalization opinions when you do pay for it"

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying!",
            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

Great app with easy commands and fast learning functions to users. Even my grandmother still using now :)",

Love this app 😻",

Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",

Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",

            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
            "Some of the fonts in other apps have change to outline after using this spp. I like help but not unnecessary changes. It is hard to read outline words. Hope you can look into this matter. Will things be back to normal should I uninstall this app.",
            "I have always downloaded the CM Apps...Launcher, Security, Cleaner, Booster, Locker...etc Before I activate any new phone I make sure my CM Apps are in place. I have had very good results with the CM Guys and Gals and keep up the Fantastic Job !!! Colleen",
            "Terrible, terrible app. Unlock your phone and see an app. Unlock your phone to see the weather you never asked for. Whenever you plug it in to charge, it locks the phone. More of an inconvenience than useful"

            "I like that it tells you if you have the wrong letter and if you get stuck you can ask for a letter. The questions are general knowledge. Another app had their puzzles according to different subjects so if you didn't know anything about that particular subject you were lost. The easy ones are hard enough for me but I like that you have a choice for people that might be more skilled in crosswords. (Smarter than I am!)",
            "Update: Some of the Clues & Answers seem to be aimed at the \"boomer\" generation and the C&A's are repeated often. It's still a great crossword game, It's a simple design, user friendly, it costs nothing to use hints. Which is great for anyone who wants to unwind. Not everyone knows who the star of \"touched by an angel\" is. And that's ok! You don't need to know. Use the hints that don't require you to watch ads, spend coins, wait (X amount) time or cost you money. Be free & relax 😊",
            "Used to be great, but now ads are too intrusive. Before, a simple silent ad would pop up and you could tap through it. Fairly low annoyance factor. Now, massive full-screen ads with obnoxiously loud audio FORCE you to watch videos for games you don't want. The frequency of the ads has increased too. The game is great otherwise, with a solid easy interface and good features. Used to be a lot of fun but I am sadly going to have to uninstall."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",

I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",

            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

(Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over £40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

No cross to close the add, clicking on the add doesn't work either, not does pressing the back button. Forcibly closing the app and restarting just shows the same add again...",
            "I would give it a 5 star if it had a search option. since some books do not have a cover, its hard to get a book unless you search it through other mean and then choose to open with Aldiko in which case it tells you that the book has already been added. I hate that but otherwise it is a superb app",

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "It's honestly addictive once you get the hang of it, which doesn't take long! And so far it's easy to level up and progress in the game unlike other games like this. Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant 😁😉",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

            "I just want to say this is an amazing game, as someone who frequently rides a sport bike at excessive speeds in heavy traffic, this is almost exactly what it's like. Great job to the devs you really capture that feeling and put it into a mobile app bravo. To make this game even better I would make the bikes customisable like paint jobs and bike mods. Maybe open a multiplayer race mode, that would be top notch. Great job devs",
            "It could be the best game of its genre but the rewards are lame. Getting cash to buy the right bike can take way too long which put me off. I would spend real money but everything is too expensive. Give me a good deal and im happy to pay but over price everything and i aint spending a penny. Real shame coz the physics, dynamics, graphics, all of that, is top notch.",
            "It was good the few first levels, but after a while, it gets really hard to get new bikes because they are really expensive, and it takes a long time to earn the cash. I literally bout a really nice bike, and after 2-3 missions, it said I needed a new one. I JUST BOUGHT IT! You literally need to grind for two hours to earn the cash for a nice bike that will last you more than 3 missions. the game was good at first. But now the fun is gone.",
            "It's an excellent game. Good graphics and very exciting. What I dislike in the game is the fact that some levels are just too difficult and nearly impossible to get the gold. You don't expect the bike to have a near miss when you line up 4 vehicles horizontally with little or no space to manauvre and also brake the speed immediately to allow movement. It's as if the game is programmed to dent good records at some certain levels. Overall it is good game.",
            "Smooth easy to control with great sense of speed still the best traffic game on mobile, I have been proud to buy with real money to support this game, hope they don't forget this and still keep up the updates, my wish list is small gentle corners maybe working traffic lights on cross junctions hence dodging side flowing traffic and more area's maybe since a Turkish developer add the pine Mountain forest roads two way one lane roads of south Turkey especially on a dawn morning just a thought."

It did this on three different songs. Instant uninstall. Play a different rhythm game please.",

I want to be able to play the game without looking or barely paying attention. I think sync should get fixed or allow us a new feature. I think allowing us to put the markers/beats would make it more enjoyable plz consider 1 of the options if you allow 1 of them then this will be the perfect app for music.",

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "Send SMS from your browser + basic Sync. If you're looking for a basic unintrusive & considerably lightweight app, this is it. For me this has taken over the heavily restrictive (bandwidth-wise) competitor AirDroid. Update: recent updates have disabled their site connecting to the internet. Updating my rating from 4 stars to 1.",
            "It's great to send and receive text and MMS messages from your computer or table (with a keyboard). I love the ability to download the photos off my phone for easy forwarding. I've been with the for four years and if want more features to really customize your experience, I highly recommend the Pro version. However the basic (free) version is really powerful for being free.",
            "Love this app. I spend a great deal of time on my PC and not my phone. To be able to get instant updates on text messages or even send from my PC is a great help. I also find it much easier to text back using my keyboard than my phone. Downloads images and videos sent to your phone. No need to transfer files to my PC. I highly recommend this app. There are versions for your phone, tablet, Gmail, and Facebook. I've ran across a few glitches and tech support jumped right on it. NO taking forever for someone to tell me to reboot a device which is so annoying. Nope. They wanted to know exactly what happened so they could reproduce the bug and fix it. It's not very long after when a new update is released to fix the issue.",
            "I've been using this service for many years now and it has made life easy. as a realtor texting has become a main form of communication this has made it easier to communicate with multiple clients seamlessly. I can also print out a thread for my records. Update... recently I forgot my phone at a friend's place but didn't realize it until morning. After they had both left work. Which meant I'm not getting my phone back till they get home later that day. Thankfully, I could still text!!",
            "Tired of knowing I paid to have this app work 1/2 the time. Want my money back and to find a New, more reliable app. Update: months later, still tired of having to relink the app to my computer multiple times/day. It gives out at the most inconvenient of times and can take minutes to days for it to start working again - even after uninstalling and relinking. If I hadn't paid for the app, I wouldn't complain. But since it's not free I feel I have the right to ask that it be reliable. When it works, I LOVE this app! It's fabulous! But they need to ensure it's reliable."

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

Squash that, this is that new normal, that next paradigm. So let me drop a dime, in the phone(cellular). I made this song in one night, during a fight, between me and my wife. I didn't have any time, but it came out sublime, wife'ys calling it a crime, gold it glows, but silver it shines, 9 times. Outta ten..zen",
            "This app rewards people for copying and singing over other artists vocals. It also rewards the same 10 - 15 people every week. Admin don't reply to queries and they also don't stick to the rules. The same rules they expect their users to stick to. If you make your own cover art and mix your own tracks Its like you're less likely to be rewarded. They also judge tracks even tho they don't make music which means they don't even know what it takes to make tracks.",
            "Not bad! I like the concept of the app and it's pretty dope. Wish there were more functions. I've been waiting to relaunch my YouTube channel and music too so this was a pretty good idea to start networking. Try it out. They have samples and demos and easy to use",
            "I love this app but right now its giving me a hard time trying to use special features like I usually would it does not even let me see the words at the bottom to apply it... whats going on with the app??? And yes I am a Suscribed member for the year.",
            "The app is decent, still room for improvement though. How about adding a info bar so the producers can give details about the song structure, bpm, and instrumental etc? I have been wanting to write songs for the longest, but without that info i cannot do it."

            "Really good game, I been playing it for two days already and I love it. But something happened: it lagged in my home and it's seems I can't move. The screen moves, I can craft and destroy blocks but I can't move. I made a new world and it works just fine, I'm kind of sad that I'm losing everything from the first one, since I made a lot of progress and I had a lot of things. I will try to play again in the new world but if the problem happens again I will rate it lower",
            "I FOUND THE GAME FINALLY. This game was my whole childhood. When I couldn't afford Minecraft, I would play this, and I remember spending hours building things. If for some reason you can't spare 10 bucks to get Minecraft, this is definitely one of the better rip-offs out there. If I could recommend one thing however, maybe implement a feature that would allow you to transfer worlds? I would be very curious as to what the world I spent hours making looks like.",
            "Very good game, good graphics. D game is cool cuz u can go to other dimension its so cool like this is d best game ever. But am rating it a 4 star bcuz in other mine crafts u can fly but this one u can't fix that and also make a setting to on/off d zombies and creepy things so u won't be scared when playing. If ur reading this download d game cuz its cool download u won't regret it.",
            "Excellent Game . But there are some problems- 1. The blocks are disappearing whenever i am visiting the snow fields 2. Today i have brought a empty milk bottle from the shop at day and went to get some milk from cow , but after going a distance from my house the game had automatically cutted ❌🚪 when i again start the game it is night ,I was in my house and there is no bottle with me ! Please let me know why it is happening🙏🙏",
            "Old Minecraft gamer- Needs auto filling in the chests so you don't get left with 5 things that can go in one stack, the bow is pretty useless even if you get amethyst bow... It doesn't shoot far enough and takes too long/awkward to draw. Other than that it's pretty awesome, although a world map would be very very useful along with having the compass."

Maybe its just me but if not I hope that can be fixed and if so, it deserves 5 stars Edit: Have had response really quickly, deserves 5 stars! Thank you...problem solved I think it was just me",

I simply cannot get into the game and it is SO frustrating. Please fix it Ludia, because I know it's not my computer.",

If you wait long enough the game kicks you out. Please fix this glitch. I wanted to skip sometime to quickly get my dinosaur. Last thing, anyone reading this, try to avoid the ads as they might crash on you. I have a S9 so it's weird how the game is crashing on me."

Also one of the things that irritate me the most is that it has an extremely noticeable lack of a replay button I have to quit the level I'm trying to restart it which is frustrating and severely irritating after a while maybe if you can tone down the ads and add a replay button this game won't be so frustrating and annoying to try to play",
            "I've been playing this for a while now and finally bought the ad free version, to support the developers. Despite closing and reopening the app though, it's very much not ad free which means I paid $3 for nothing. Each level still requires ad views and each special box does as well. No clue what my $3 went to, but certainly not what it was advertised as.",
            "First off, it's had so much lag since I installed it, it's ridiculous. I have never played anything in my life with more lag. Secondly, there are so many ads that I feel as if I spend more time watching those than playing the game, EVEN WITH IT TAKING LONGER BECAUSE OF LAG. This app completely isn't worth it. Don't waste your time.",

While it is a deeper Linux experience it only accesses its own environment. Thus you will want to keep both apps as Terminal Emulator actually accesses user internal storage. On multiuser devices The owner has an extra group membership which enables them to do admin things and write to removable storage.",

Not being able to CTRL+C out of a ping has driven me into the arms of another. I will look back with fond memories. Rest in peace, my sweet. *Throws dirt on coffin*",
            "Every coding app in every store is full of back doors, remotes controls and server tunnels. It ridiculus. What happened to the security of downloading from playstore? I laid my phone down for 15 minutes.. this app disappeared along with all of my developer tools. My passwords were change, my personally built repositories are missing from four email accounts I use as cloud storage. 2 phones wiped clean of anything that had value. These crooks running around in here don't want to do the work.",
            "Was great for earlier versions of Android. Recently, I had to update phones to Android 10 and found that i couldn't access functionality that was previously usable. As someone else stated, ctrl-c and all of the other hot keys do not work. Can we expect an update to allow these?",

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

            "Meh. In the beginning it's great but now after 2 years it's completely stale. I've dropped enough money into the game to see it go no where. The rewards are lacking, the amount of time, energy and money you need to tier 3 characters is laughable. I'm tired of timeline battles and old story modes. Everything is just repeating... It's no longer fun. I will play once a day and then move on to better things and eventually just stop playing all together. Not dropping anymore more money into this.",
            "Been playing this game since 4 years now and these are the things that I've realized...they never listen to their player base; rewards against your hard work are just peanuts; used to be free to play friendly, but over a period of time, it has become more paywall friendly. No improvement in rewards but unnecessary changes in the game to grab your cash. So, if you wish to play this game coz of your beloved Marvel Characters, you need to be filthy rich. I used to support this game but no more.",
            "I have played this game for 5 years on different accounts. Never have I ever felt cheated before. But the new system introduced in the latest update has broke the game. If you pay, you win. Its that simple. The cost has increased exponentially (to the thousands) and as such I cannot recommend this game. I loved this game but its finished now. Find a better game to invest in.",
            "Playing this game is like collecting good looking models. That's it. Oh, a number of them, you need real cash to get them, and a few of those are not worth it gamewise. After years of playing, I find it not enjoyable anymore due to the cost it demands every update. I feel sorry for my investment to this game up until recently. If you, reader, want a Marvel game to play, this isn't the one. Hard pass.",
            "I've been playing for a long time but this latest update is horrible. Confusing and redundant systems being added that do not enhance the game but seem to be geared to force players to spend money. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a game LOOK ELSEWHERE. Even veteran players are boycotting this game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "Been a loyal user for many years and now the app has gone downhill, can't make collages anymore - I go to add pics to begin the process and it just hangs from there and never loads. I'm even paying this, worked better when it was free 🙄",
            "Not good. Too many glitches. Too many bugs I think. Keep stopping in the middle while doing work. Very unstable. I'm afraid not worth for money if buy premium. Reconsider my purchase. Try to look to other app which more stable",
            "This used to be my go-to editor until it switched to a subscription model. Now it only sometimes let's me even use the software, insisting I be online... even when I am in fact online. Searching for a replacement app now. Edit: Dropping from 2 stars to one... the devloper responded with \"make sure you have a good network connection.\" I'm three feet from a router connected to a fiber optic network connection, I am very very very connected to the internet. This is not my issue, this is yours.",
            "I used this app for years. I get it, people got to make money to survive and using an ad model is pointless these days. Yet, I personally think it would have been nice to have a warning about moving to a subscription model. Maybe like the popup that occurs now that blocks me from any edits, a popup for a month prior that said, \"Hey, we appreciate you but times are tough and in a month's time we will be moving to a subscription model.\" Instead, suddenly I cannot use the app.",
            "Honestly used to use pixlr all the time, not even thinking about the possibility it would lower the quality of the image. Recently however, I have looked closer and realized it makes every photo extremely pixilated! I'm not sure if this is a recent thing, or a thing I somehow missed, but it's extremely disappointing from an otherwise great photo editing app."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",

It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "Edit 5/10/2020: This used to be such a beautiful app, always used it in place of the regular Telegram. Downgrading the rating for two reasons 1. It hasn't been updated since May 2020 and 2. It still hasn't received the Video Calling update that the regular app has had for two months. What gives? I thought this version was supposed to receive newer updates sooner.",
            "It's great! But when i uninstalled and reinstalled, it seems to not work on my mobile data anymore. All my other messaging apps still work so the problem isn't with me. I've tried all the solutions on Google, like clearing cache, but no use. It only seems to work on wifi which is such a shame. Is there a way to fix this issue? Has anyone else encountered this too?",
            "Definitely lightweight and hogs way less resources in background compared to the official app and it's forks like Plus Messenger. Faster? maybe, the animations in TGX are slick but overall it's the same speed as official app. All I want to see is this app getting updates atleast once in 2 weeks to keep up with new telegram features, then it'll be perfect!",
            "This app is a very general and decent one to use for chatting to people anywhere in the world. The calls are typically much clearer than Discord, and I love the fact you can send videos of any size, unlike Discord. The reason it only gets a 3 star is because there's no option to delete/block contacts on the mobile version of the app. It's a hinderance to need to get onto a computer to remove a contact you don't want.",
            "It is very good app for sharing bigger file. At first it downloaded the file properly. But now it's not downloading.... It's a big problem. It's very difficult because I 've to reinstall and install every time so please rectify this problem. If it can't download any file and it seems very useless. So please rectify this problem as soon."

            "Worst texting app for many reasons, first of all I earn credits but it uses them if I receive messages, but worst of all it makes bots to text you to use up all your credits, I've had over 60 credits and now all gone because they put bots to take your credits for receiving messages. You sometimes dont even get your messages on time at all. The offers never work. Worst texting app and if you wanted to text or call you might as well pay for a carrier service. Dont install or waste your time....",
            "This app is really great if you know your email password. But, I finally found mine, and used it, and this app is great! You can call and text. obviously. But you just watch videos to get credits, and watchibg videos to talk to people isn't bad compared to paying each month. This app os great. LOVE IT!!!!",
            "Typical Wifi texting App, filled with Ads nonstop and left to right. I forgot when I re-downloaded this you have to have \"credits\" that expire every 48 hours to text anything or call anyone which is so stupid. To get more credits you have to, you guessed it sit through 15 second to 1 minute adds for half a credit to 1 full credit each. I would've skipped the download button and tried remembering which other App is the REAL free one and doesn't use credits. Don't download, find other free one.",
            "I accidentally un install the apps, I tried to install again and log in my email address but I can't log in even if I click the forgot pass word. Please help me. This is my second time, before you don't take an action about my problem on this apps. All my credit I didn't use it. Waste of time.. grrrr. I will rate your apps if you fix my problem.",
            "I'm only giving 4stars easy to understand and set up, but I haven't tried calling with it, and have not received any calls yet, I'll be sure to edit the rating for you, 🤞,ok I have had this app for a while now and I absolutely love it, clear calling, easy to use and understand, I have shared with many friends and family, keep up the good work and THANK YOU 😉😉"

            "The extra filters keep disappearing after a couple of weeks or so. I am fed up with constantly having to reinstall them. Am uninstalling. Haven't the time or patience. A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

            "Awesome game. I think the developers are flat earth believers. Try going into the river and drive to the right. The truck goes upto a 1000 kmph. Looks really fun but you end up losing $200 game currency as the fuel runs out. 😂",
            "Great game, well payed in the game currency, but you need the street lights on the opposing side of the street, and an american map, and it would be nice to have different sirens, and to have a red and white lights, with a fire dept. Symbol you can edit please.",
            "Really good game, but I think it could be better if it had a few different scenarios instead of the same options on the GPS buttons but they should have different countries where you can see and use"

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"

            "I've been searching for an app that gives me the key and bpm of a song and be consistently reliable and easy to use and this app is the closest I've found. However it doesn't detect the key correctly on most of the minor songs even after buying the upgrade. So until this is fixed it's only getting 2 stars from me.",
            "It doesn't completely mute the lead solo, the only option is to reduce the lead sound which affects almost everything. I really don't know what this app is for but I thought I can create backing track from the original music. It's not usefull",
            "No minor scales! I wish this would read minor scales. Instead it only gives the major options to find you key. This is an incomplete app. 2 stars off. Now I need to go find a real app. It works great, but missing a whole half of the program.",

            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",

I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that.

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

Levels just go higher, but not harder. Coins mean nothing, points you get for pushing people off mean nothing, achievements mean nothing.",

            "Interesting game, graphics and sound good but, inability to move to the next stage though I was qualified, by winning in the previous stage and also investing the needed amount, is a put off... So please I hope you would work on it ASAP. Then I will give 5 stars",
            "Well the game is petty good but when i get a wide open 90% it misses and i cant stand that and when you go for a dunk it automatically just like looks like you're doing a layup but like why does it have to be in slow motion and when I go to unlock character I mean a new ball it just new ball action or or closed it just says new ball a lot and then he doesn't even show nothing like the game and then I'll give you a 5-star rating because this game should be like NBA 2K 20",
            "This is great, but I don't like the graphics of this game ,I'm dizzy by it's movements and the worst of all even I'm gonna dunk,shoot in 3 it won't shoot please fix it. So for now I'm giving it a 3. Until you fix it.",
            "The game is good and enjoyable but when ever I want to pass I will send it to my men but it will go to the other team please fix it but it is a good game i am sure that people will like it"

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",

It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "This game is addictive! Since I have only five lives I can't get bored of it, and I love the new challenges they continue to add to the game as I get further and further, there are however flaws as well, there aren't many things to buy with your money, so now I have tons of money but nothing to buy with it except powerups which I rarely use. Another flaw is the ads, they are SO FREQUENT! I think the game could use more customization options for your trail and character color, good game though!",
            "Ads, ads, ads. Ya don't want 'em? Too bad. If i'm reviewing the concept? This is a fantastic game, somewhat a mix of escape games and pinball. The little sprite is cute, and the graphics are simplistic, but very well-made. If I'm reviewing the gameplay? (For summary, see title.) This is an awful game. Lurking behind these \"honest\" ads is a whole mess.",
            "One of the best games in my life this game is very amazing I never had anything like it I played it when I was three to four me and my little sister we do challenges pretending that we are grown up and we have children and then if we lose we die and then we staying to the game forever we play this game a lot in her basement I hope people like this game and I hope this game is rated 5 stars I love you Tomb of mask🥳💗",
            "Change is good because it's like a board game but it's very fun and it's very funny you get lots of coins and stuff and I'm already on a level 69000 I'm very good and I just stopped playing 5 seconds ago is very good",
            "There is literally no ads at all and the game is good. There's a bug that you sometimes get stuck in arcade mode to where you can't even move. But, alas, the game is still pretty good. 1 out of 10 I'd say the game is an 8."

Plus creates much more intensive study of \"hundreds\" of unlockable characters and their superpowers. The opt-in upgrades are cheap enough, and for about 20 dollars I unlocked about a dozen characters in under three weeks, including Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Bane, Green Arrow and both versions of Deadshot!",

Only one request please provide hero fragments for other heroes in the Red Alert battles such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc. And please do something to spend the essence and to earn legendary essence.

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing.

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant. Auto-Fire is Good but, enabling aim-assistant automatically with auto-fire is really a Bad idea.",
            "Best game. Sensivity of this game is best. Graphics are best. Easy to push our rank. And the best game under 50 mb. And their are more than 6 map in this game. The new update is awesome. And one request can you change the clan war settings.",
            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

If it doesn't for some miraculous reason then this is a ten star app . 20 stars. \"The Catch\" has not yet made it's appearance and I'm an hour and several hundred songs downloaded into it. My experience in life keeps me jaded and certain that soon I will learn once again - for perhaps the 459,000th time - that \"You Do Not Get Something For Nothing\" , yet I admit to an unfamiliar sensation fluttering faintly in my chest: the flicker of Hope...?",
            "I like this app, and use it frequently. If I had a complaint, though, it would be that as it reels through the playlist, alot of the time, after maybe 4-6 songs, even set on \"shuffle\", it gets stuck in a \"rut\", and starts playing the same songs over. Not a deal breaker for a free app, by any means, but an annoyance, nonetheless. I had a little trouble finding \"my\" music at first (I'm old), but am finding more and more to be available.",
            "Just got it, but so far SOOO GOOD! Downloads are very quick and I have already unlocked some boosters, which means my downloads are even faster, and I can listen while I download...😊 I have only had the app for about five minutes.. it does suck u have to keep app open and on the screen or else your download stops...but I think it's well worth the wait and undecided attention... it literally took me less than 3 minutes to download a whole album of about 24 songs.. I'm excited😜👱‍♀️",
            "When you skip a song, you get the same 5 songs even if you have 30 or more. This app does not have every song you're looking for and there are some songs that are \"Coming Soon\", but you check months later and it's still not there. The only things I like about this app is that there are unlimited skips, no ads, and you can pick any song you want to play from your playlist(s).",
            "It's a really good app, no ads while playing music, can choose what you want to play, completely free but I have one issue. The are 3 songs I've looked up and didn't find anywhere, I couldn't even request them. And they are missing a lot of my favorite songs right now. Just hope they can get some more music on the app. Other wise really good app."

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

            "This app is great. Lots of options. However, it irritates the friggin piss outta me that even though the app has been around for years and they're mostly known for their TV shows, they still don't have a Skip Intro option! If I'm binge watching a show, I don't wanna have to watch the intro every single freakin time! Disney+ has it and they haven't even been out for a year yet! Like why hasn't that been added yet!?",
            "Commercials commercialscommercials Maybe it is deliberate to drive you to buy the ad-free option. It just makes me despise Hulu. It makes even Netflix seem like a good app. If you want to rewind, it triggers commercials. Fast-forward? Commercials. Not infrequently, you get to see the same set of commercials. Sometimes, you get to watch them three times in a row. Over and over and over. Yay. (It's maddening.) And avoidable. And inept programming.",
            "I've never had an issue with this program in all the years I've used it, however, NOW I DO and I need to uninstall and reinstall, but there is NO way that I found to do that, yet.... What a serious pain and it shouldn't be. This is my home computer, and this shouldn't be a national secret how to do this! I'm soooo damn annoyed. The program loads just fine, but soon as I click a play arrow it freezes everything. I looked at the tools/inspect page, it clear shows the play path has been altered somehow. I don't do computer coding or maybe I could fix this myself, but it should be a simple fix to uninstall and reinstall like you would on your phone. I'm 65 years old, I am running Windows 7 because I like it. This really shouldn't be happening.",
            "Very convenient for listening to my news programs on ABC while out of town or otherwise away from home. But \"watching\" my shows on the Hulu app mean I can't multi-task on my phone. It would be nice to adjust settings so it continued to play while my phone is locked or if I go to another app. Like I do with audiobooks. And when I put my unlocked phone in my pocket with the app running, it always seems to bounce to another show on my \"next up\" list before the show I am interested ends.",
            "I love Hulu I will always have it on my phone! I usually never have a problem and if i do, the app some how fixes its self. If i disconnect i just reload and its fixed. I have never had a issue that prevented me from watching my favorite adult cartoons. The price is good the content is awesome! I can always find something to watch for what ever situation. Hulu is doing everything right in my book!"

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",

            "I absolutely LOVE this game. The only criticism is that some pieces dont fit into the puzzles and when it's part of a timed event, it can get a little frustrating. Otherwise, the puzzles are really fun and the graphics are pretty good. I really like the events, and find myself playing this game every day. If you like Puzz-3D you'll LOVE this game. I enjoy learning about all of the different places created, and that new places are a available every week. I hope it is supported for a long time.",
            "I wish there were more room to describe in painful detail how much this game relies on ads. I like ad-based games. Do NOT get me wrong. But when you need to play a 30sec ad to start AND finish a level and to move from screen to screen and to play in the timed events, it takes away from the greatness of the game. My major prob is with being given a choice: ad at the end of a lvl to get more coins or no ad for fewer coins. Easy, right? Except you get an ad either way. This app is dreadful.",
            "The puzzles are fun but the ads are pretty insufferable in the free version. Even when clicking on a puzzle without the ad sign next to it you will have to watch an ad. When closing a puzzle you will have to watch an ad. I'd give it 5 stars if only there were fewer or less irritating ads.",
            "I love this. I don't even care about the adds. I LOVE THIS !!!!! I just wish that I could update more often. Thats how much I play. It says \" bug fixed \". Sometimes it will say that it updated when it didn't. I do play it ALOT, PLEASE FIX THE UPDATE BUTTON. I am addictive to these puzzles. I also learn alot about the places that i did not know. Keep giving me more. CAN I GET AN UPDATE PLEASE DAMN.",
            "I love this game it is amazing how it challenges your brain to fix the puzzle. There is one problem though. The events are hard to do as the cost in game money. And to usually get that is to do puzzles or to get the amount to do the event is real life money. That is all that needs fixed don't make events to expensive. All in all great game."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "This is a fun game when you got no internet like me. I don't get ads cause i'm offline. The reason I give it a four-star is because the game is slow. When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

The characters are expensive and the guns are also expensive you can, you spin paying only cash but you don't get alot cash and you also don't get cash for killing zombies and completing missions I think you only get when you purchase it when level up. Guys I think you add something in the new update of this game to allow us to earn cash more easily. This is a good game it's just hard and I recommend it hope y'all enjoy",

            "Horrible , this is basically a copy of Flipaclip. I don't know how people rate this 5 stars. I'm disappointed even if this is 3 stars. I got in it and I zoomed in and it zoomed in way too much, that's fine one mistake okay? Then I tried to zoom out and all it did was draw, annoying. But that was the 3rd thing. The 1st thing was that when I looked at it before I got it, it looked like a copy of flipaclip.. like bro? Cant u get your own ideas!?!?",
            "The app was okay? But it was difficult to navigate. I couldn't figure out how to change canvas size, its near impossible to get any video that's more than five seconds, and the pre-set amount of frames is restrictive because i don't know how many frames I'm gonna use when I first start out. Please upgrade because Id really like to see this program get better..",
            "I logged in on my tablet just fine which is on desktop mode. I downloaded the app to my phone and it refuses to log me in. There is no option to log in with google on the app. The app was also EXTREMELY buggy on my tablet. The opacity/brush size bars kept changing on their own, my frames would switch themselves, the sensor reading for the app is HELLA glitchy as it wont draw at all at times, and MY FRAMES DELETED THEMSELVES MINUS THE BACKGROUND. I cant even change my password! This app SUCKS!!!!",
            "Because of the newest update, this app is actually tolerable. The layout is much better, it looks a lot cleaner, and it's not nearly as glitchy. It's still not the best, but so much better than the old version. It does bug me that you can't have a pallete without paying for it anymore, but you do have the eyedropper tool, so i guess it's fine. It could be better, but actually seems usable now. It is missing a lot of features though, such as a line/circle tool, and maybe some more brushes.",
            "It was a very confusing app to use, for example the settings are a bit wierd and the fact that say I have my brush on level 5 and I want to erase something I have to change the thickness of it every time. So overall it wasn't a good experience"

Help the citizens, complete collections, find Ectoplasm and get the grand Forsaken Abbey! <br><br>Fixes and Improvements<br>* Added a plane purchasing animation!<br>* Now bonuses are all in a separate store<br>* Fixed the bug with the Campus Park",
        "comments": [
            "4 stars only because planes can back into each other, bump into each other and sometimes go through each other depending on what planes and how many planes are in que. Also, making enough money to expand or upgrade is way too slow. The more I ply, the less I like this game. Getting what you need is really based on how much time you play the game at one time. Two stars now. This game is no longer fun to play. It's a chore.",
            "This game has improved it is still slow going unless you spend real dollars but now the bonus is that every 14 days you get one game dollar so there is the chance to advance even thought it is slow, it is now possible. Bad thing for me is now I am tempted to spend real funds to get to my goals quicker.",
            "I'm glad I didn't spend any money on the game for 2 reasons. 1)it really is not necessary to spend money if you're just a little patient. It does have advertising which you can watch instead of spending on the game. 2)I've got a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which is an above average smartphone in terms of its capabilities but the game frequently glitches necessitating closing & restarting which is a problem. Worse is that the developers don't acknowledge issues when reported. It's fun & addictive tho",
            "Since the latest update I'm not able to use my own comfort classes, only the free ones in every few hours. There's no possibility to use mine outside these free times. Also hawk planes often get stuck at the end of the runway and I have to close the game to make them go away. Takes an awful long time to collect coins.",
            "I LOVE this game. It is so involved and there is so much going on that once you level up a few times and you've got say 3 ore more planes and a couple of helicopters, you can literally stay busy constantly collecting passengers, money, exp. points etc...... that you can actually \"play\" the game for hours and your eyes and fingers never leave the screen. The special collections are so cool!! The only thing I don't like about it is a cost a lot of coins to upgrade buildings, buy aircraft etc."

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

Other than that, The game is fantastic!",

Then it wanted to download an extra 140 odd mb before I could play. It would have been useful to know that beforehand or, you know, have that included in the original download. I didn't bother beyond that point, didn't seem worth it.",
            "This game has a nice set up. Comparing metal slug attack, but before you actually downloading this game. There is important information regarding the game. Ads, Ads, Ads, and Ads. Seriously... This game has too much Ads. Want to look at the shop? Ad. Want to go back on a Misson? Ad... You fail that mission? Ad.... Get done finishing up that mission? Ad. This game has TOO MANY ADS! I know this is hard times, but you don't need to shove ads down our throats. Seriously. This isnt Cable TV!Reducesit",

            "I would have given no stars had this option existed. Forget playing the game I couldn't even start playing. To download 1% of 146MB data it took 5 mins. I am on 50Mbps broadband connection."

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "It's been quite the ride for me with this series and it all started with Blitz. Seeing how it evolved from its humble \"Temple Run-esque\" style of gameplay to racing against fellow Beach Buggy characters and making it to the top, now racing with powerup decks, a leveling system and chest rewards. Honest, I want to see things that are in the current game added to this classic so there's more of a reason to come back to this \"oldie, but a goodie\". More vehicles, more customization options, etc. 😁",
            "I remember playing this game when I was 5 decided to play it again and hearing that guitar filled me with nostalgia. The game is addicting and the controls are great. And also to the people who are complaining about racing in the game and how the drivers start before you, they made 2 racing games about that. All I want is more themes like night, rain,snow etc. Other than that amazing game I loved it to bits. Also RIP the 800000 pelicans I ran over",
            "I think the game is pretty cool. But it would have been better if there were stages to unlock. Because playing it is like playing a temple run facing game but it's alright. I mean, the graphics are ok and the racing 8s really fun. It brings the experience of actually controlling a cartoon character in racing.",
            "In this game we explore good places, the music is excellent ,we have goods power ups, good contols, good characters, good cars .We can paint cars . This game is very very amazing. We can never be lonely with this game",
            "Perfect for Android cheapies just the first one a bit like Street fighter two just keeps an eye on ya and it makes you play better. Another great game good bad and the coolest and best game, sometimes when I'm training I like to turn the volume down and listen to some choice music.🤠"

            "Developer please reply. HD camera CAN'T BE TRUSTED FOR EMERGENCIES 😡. I love this app but it opens PLAY STORE FIRST!!!!! and I'd have to switch opened apps severally before I use it. After viewing a captured pic, I'd have to go through the same problem as though I'm now launching it. It makes me think the boot time is 💩. I thought I should update it, I did but same 🙄😏",

            "Everytime I want to take a picture and it's a once in a lifetime shot, it shows an ad. That's crappy service! 04/06/20 If I could give a negative I would. Camera over rides location settings and keeps taking them and storing them with photos. :(",

Normal fixes (clear cache, reinstall, etc) do not work. Worked fine until just recently. All other apps on the tablet function, as intended. Only one does not, Verizon.",
            "While the app itself can be useful, please don't allow yourself to fall for the Verizon Up reward program that the app will nag you about incessantly. You essentially agree to allow them to spy on everything you do with your phone, and harvest all kinds of your personal data in the process, by signing up for it. They aren't trying to be your pal, they just want your consent to profit even more off of your account.",
            "It does not save my login credentials - I have to re-log in every time I open it, even when I have \"Remember Me\" selected & permissions on. Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",
            "The app keeps me up to date with my data limit, I can pay my bill, look at my bill, and get my $3.00 Amazon gift card every month with the app. Make sure you take advantage of receiving and using your $3.00 gift card every month to offset your bill. It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",
            "Very buggy along with their website. I been trying to fix my billings, plans, add-ons for the longest time and still seem to be getting the run around. App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

            "This is my favorite truck driving game, good controls, challenging, lots of fun, the only bad thing is while you're driving the ads that pop up at the top of the screen and stay there while you're driving makes the game lag so bad you can't hardly control or play the game ,So if you could Please fix this problem, I would Definitely give 5 stars",
            "The game is okay. But there are a lot of ads. The controls are hard because they are so small. The triangles for turning are okay but they are tiny so it makes it harder. Half the time i try to hook up to a trailer the truck and trailer collide causing damage on the truck and it wont hook so i have to exit out of the game to reset it so hopefully the next time i watch 5 ads to get in it will hook to a trailer. The game iver all is fun but every time i stop to get fuel, at the scale, or to sleep",
            "When you try to hook up the load most of the time it acts like your hitting something or your truck just goes right threw the load, very frustrating!! And you can't see the red lights even when zoomed in, please fix these problems! Other than that great game, I will give 5 stars, when fixed, thanks.",
            "The gameplay is superb. But needs some improvement in graphics and make it a bit more realistic. The game also needs 6-lane roads and new places in the map. Overall this has the best handling among all the other simulators. Also, everytime I go to Nashville, I'm charged with a speed ticket, no matter how slow or how fast I am. I have been playing this since 2017 and still cant get enough. Although now a little bored with gfx and maps.",
            "Couldn't play the game for more than 15 seconds without an ad. And why would I want to pay for an ad free experience if I haven't had an opportunity to try the game. Also, the game requests access to contacts, and wants permission to make and manage phone calls which seems odd for a game like this."

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

            "Very nice game, I always wanted a game that 1. Was like salt 1 and salt 2 2. A game with no ads and doesn't sell personal information. 3. A developer that supports the game and the people who play it. 4. A game that only takes 2MB! However, I do wish that you could after saying Never to that prompt for the membership, you could still have an option to buy the membership without re installing it. Thats my only complaint, other than that, the game is fun and enjoyable, I recommend installing.",
            "I really like it, but there's some things that really annoy me. The uranium shouldn't always go critical and explode as there's plenty of options in game to keep it cool (specially in small quantities) and when under pressure liquid nitrogen as well as other liquids should remain there instead of simply disappearing. I would love to provide better feedback and help you improve this engine. It's really fun, but frustrating.",
            "I am obsessed with this game. It's so relaxing and gives me so much creativity to do whatever I want. I can cause absolute chaos, experiment with different materials that correspond with real-life physics, cause more chaos after getting distracted from my experiment. And it is so relaxing and satisfiying. Not to mention ad free, bless these people. 10/5 stars if I could",
            "When I was in 5th or 6th grade my friends and I were all obsessed with a game similar to this on one of the popular flash game sites of the time (this is over 15 years ago, like before Numa Numa Dance). I haven't seen another game like it since, so it's a really nice to see someone bring it back. We used to kill hours with that game back in the day, and I can see I'm going to be doing the same now! There's some suggestions I could make, but the dev is well on their way to perfection as-is.",
            "As a kid I just loved playing in the sandbox. This sandbox is even better than the one that I played in as a kid, all the different elements for one thing are so much better. And I never even found one cat turd. Thanks for omitting the cat turds, although I would like to see what the reaction would be between cat turds and crud oil mixed. And exposed it to a flame. Thanks to the developers of the game and the fact that you have no ads. Thanks again, Big \"D\"🙈🙉🙊"

            "I love this game very much. But I need a game where there is more than 20 countries. There will 1 airport on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One country to another country. (Suppose that I will go from Japan to USA then I will need to buy ticket, like $1100). There will minimum 3/4 railway stations on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One area to another area . (Suppose that I will go from New York to another one then I will need to buy ticket, like $110)",
            "I liked this game so much but i want new job places like a bank,a post office, a office,a police station,etc.And why is not there any fire department,bus station,etc from where we can take the job.We shouldn't be able to take parked vehicles without its keys. There should more of job like buildings which we can go inside to take keys of the vehicle(for rent) parked for the job.After any job is done we should only be able to get money by collecting it from its departmentbyparking itsvehicle back",
            "I rate five stars not because it's a generally good game, but because it's very janky and it's just perfect. But add more houses, a larger open world, and melee weapons. Thanks!",

Because when a car crash you can finish the race with your crashed car. It has many tracks and you can travel to other cities. The game is goooood!!! I need to see the \"lynkan hypersport\" in this game that is my favourite car",
            "I am only 12 and I wasn't really that much of a 12 year old kid that really liked to play games until I downloaded it and it is so fun you get to customize your vehicle like the engine, tires, paint, and other things. And the derbys are so fun to play you can have up to 11 or 12 cars with you in the derby. And the best part is it is offline. One last thing could you add a 1970 dodge charger with the engine sticking out of the hood please.",
            "This is a awesome game! Really love this game. I gave this game 5 stars! Because the controls is alright, the gameplay is awesome and the graphics is very good... What I love is that, this is not just a demolition derby, you can do racing as well! That makes it more fun to play and addictive. Keeps me busy and I enjoy this game alot! Would give it 6 stars if I could ;-) I would love to see my favourite car 1969 Volkswagen Beetle!",
            "It's a good game and everyone should get it. I like the game it's a fun game to play I have made five or six cars completely upgraded and they are really cool cars and I rely won't to now what car is under the torp I bet it a good car 🚗. I always make my car red whith red wendos and white flams it's rely cool . They also have red and white tiyers.",
            "This game is really fun but the down side is that it gives u a little bit of ads when u finish the racing on but over all it is really fun. Their is so many cars that u can buy and wheels so many things that u need to check out but I really wish their was a monster truck in the game it would be so much better."

            "Oh no here comes the infamous me on when I believe when something is not good to me or to my liking. The reason why this gets no stars is because it keeps exiting for no apparent reason. I keep trying to make a video. But the app itself keeps exiting out and telling me the app has stopped! Someone needs to de-bug this quick this is a vet in the google app store!🤬 Ps. And I love \"video fx\" But it needs to be fixed Needless to say I already done an upcoming famous video to it. Please be smart."

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "I LOVE this game and have become SO addicted! I love how it's an offline game and it's simple but entertaining for when I'm not connected to wifi, and even when I am. The only thing I could say could be improved is the amount of ink you get. The bosses have GIANT vehicles and I'm on level 550 and dont have much ink. The ink cost so much after you buy about 5 lots and it doesnt give you that much. Overall, I love this game!",
            "I like this before. But now I dont like how the players are cheating and ruined my game so I give this a one star. And I really hate it now!",
            "So in the top left corner you can see how the opponents car and figure out what you can make to destroy it best this game is amazingly good 👍 👌 💯",
            "It reminds me of robot wars. Draw your car and destroy. Glitch where car flies into the sky and you cant tell what happening is a little annoying. New enemies and bosses in the future would be nice. Maybe harder difficulties with them having cannons and a smarter AI that moved on its own.",
            "It's pretty simple and addicting. I just wish it were more challenging. Right now the AI reacts to whatever you're doing. It won't charge on its own or anything, you basically control both your car and the other car. You can also overpower yourself to the point of almost everything being too easy to be any fun. Wall-less maps are pretty much worthless because you can just ram the other car off immediately. Stronger and more intelligent enemies would be a great addition."

            "Sept 28, 2020 MetroPCS by T-Mobile changed to the Scam and Spam app . Updated January 6, 2020 from 2/25/19 Absolutely the best $2.50 a month ever! No more Telemarketing, scams, or annoyingly winded people. Blocks Telemarketers! This particular app has worked for me over a year now. Still working like a charm. Ha, Make it year 3!The best company in the States for service is MetroPCS by T-Mibile. Service, connection, and the people are great. X 💚🐢",
            "I have appreciated this name id blocking unwanted calls until today when it blocked a contact of mine. Now I'm wondering how many other contact calls have been blocked without knowing...I hope this glitch gets fixed!!!",
            "I like it very much, however the 1 thing I don't like is the list of numbers stay forever. Also the old way 1 could check a number if one got thru. Is there anyway to clear the numbers in the activity sectipn? I have a list that goes back over 8/9 months. I use it often however still have the same problem with the ph. nbrs. Is there a way to delete some of the old nbrs?",
            "I'm so glad I have this! With so many scams I've gotten where I dont want to answer any calls but now, stopping them has been easy. Although, I wish it included text messages as well.",
            "I am a maintenance supervisor and I'm busy all through the day and it's really nice to not be getting a lot of unnecessary phone calls to interrupt me while I'm doing things I truly appreciate this app and all that it does for me thank you so very much."

            "This game is repetitive, but start winning & collecting more money it'll get addictive. Been playing 4 quite some time. Keep coming back 2 try 2 get a new car which takes a while. The most u can win, even in 1st place, is like $450 & that's if u watch an ad. The car I have now cost me $150,000. Had 2 watch many ads lol. 😄 U can buy $$, but that's cheating.🤥 I do really like this game, but PLEASE MAKE NEW TRACKS FOR US! This GAME is 2 GREAT not 2!! MUCH LOVE & HAPPY HALLOWEEN! ☠🎃👻",
            "This game is awesome 👍😊😊. It has less ads which other game don't have. It is the best game. The only problem is that it has only 20levels and the same tracks. But it is a very good game. Thank you...🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️",
            "This game is great. But just one problem that it gives few coins, for this I can not buy a new car and please change those old tracks.",
            "The game is fun you can stay there a whole day... The problem is with ads but let me just be frank, i can not afford to purchase the ad free app😂",
            "This game is so fun I can't stop playing it I just wish that the cars will little less harder to get but other than that I really like the game and please make more"
