            "I've tried a few migraine trackers, and I think I like this one the best. Its relatively simple to figure out and I like that I can add my own descriptors for pain/symptoms, location, and triggers. I wish there was a way to kind track possible triggers as I'm not always sure what has caused my migraines. However, I just list all the options possible for that migraine in particular in order to try and figure things out from there.",
            "Useless, tried it once and deleted it. (Better off using migraine buddy instead if u have migraines or diagnosed medical issues) This is completely pointless-for example, there are no migraine/headache medications listed under medications other than asprin, tea & coffee??? There are not even basic triggers listed under triggers. Completely and utterly useless.",
            "Seems to lack an important feature...or maybe I just don't know how to use it. I'm talking about recording the progression of a headache. For instance, it stars off as a three but within an hour, it's 6. But all you seem to be able to do is to change the number without keeping the old score, which means that your final record will show that all your headaches started as 6 and did not develop gradually. Please tell me if I missed something as otherwise the app is really easy to use and v. good",
            "I just used this app for the first time today. It was relatively easy to use and self-explanatory. However, at the end of the day I needed to edit that particular migraine and I could not find a way to edit what I had posted earlier in the day. 🙁",
            "I really like this app. It tracks my headaches, but I also keep track of what I eat every day to see if food might be a trigger. The only reason why I didn't give this app 5 stars is that I wish when I record a headache of 0 severity it would be counted as not a headache...otherwise a great app. Highly recommended!"

It's hard to rely on memory alone or write when having an illness so this is a really quick way for me to record for all my doctor's.",

And I wanted so sign it, but not sure how beneficial it is? Help will be greatly appreciated.",

            "Great app but I have seen in some other comments how people were not happy about the logging of past headaches.... it is possible but they didn't know how to use it. I would like to see an improved version of the pain location. That for one headache you could logg in more than 1 pain evolution and add the time which would make the reading of the time line of the pain intensity more effective.",
            "It lost a lot of information I entered about a headache because I hit the wrong button. It has some features that are easy better than *migraine buddy* but in some cases the app is difficult to use. The developers should design it with the idea in mind that people with migraines might not be feeling or thinking the best when they fill out details in the app. It should be harder to lose details and data, easier to enter times and days, and easier to side scroll the timeline of symptoms to specific points and see where you're at. If you change the start time of a migraine it competent screws up the pain levels timeline."

            "I have tried several binaural/isochronic tone apps. This is the first one I've had success with in dealing with a migraine. I bought the premium pack to support the developer but prefer the tones without music. Thank you",
            "couple ads adds to headache annoyances but is not bothersome when the app does as described for free of course there are extra addons which I find unnecessary when it has what you need to release your migrain pain very easily and simple. I love being able to combine the 4 different tones after my pain faded away I played around making a beat which sort of felt like it was opening up certain audio canals that had been clogged idk? did make me yawn alot. placebo or not , it's free and helped. S8",
            "I believe it helped sooth my small headache I feel better and now I don't have to worry it will turn into a migraine. Good app.",
            "Works on my headaches, migraines and, as a bonus, helps me to fall and stay asleep. Full-on debilitating migraine doesn't go away, but this app does at least help soothe my pain. Paid so I could access all tracks so I could see if any help more than others during any neural pain episodes.",
            "I'm in the military and sometimes I sleep in the barracks during training with sometimes 30+ people. When I can't sleep from all the snoring, I turn on this app inside my headphones and go right to sleep! Works great for mental therapy and focus."

Did you visit a health care professional...well, given that we're in midst of a pandemic and can't get to see one unless you are quite literally dying... This app needs work.",

            "This game is great, and I love to play it, but two things really get on my nerves, 1 definately more important than number 2. 1: Crashing. Every 5-8 minutes of playing the music will start to cut out (every single time it crashes) and then the game will close/crash. I have, so far, only seen 1 other review for crashes. 2: Slow pace. I don't like how slow the game progresses, it seems that it takes FOREVER to get the the next level, especially the more levels you climb, but that's just me.",
            "Edit: servers are undergoing maintenance, apparently. This is the first time this has happened for me without a notification popping up. Sigh. The game refuses to connect to the server despite me being on WiFi. It simply says \"unable to connect to server, check your connection\". I have checked, and my connection is fine. Please fix this. It's one thing to lose out on bonuses after activating boosters if I forget to log in, but another if I'm prevented from logging in altogether.",
            "Game crashes too easily nd issue is almost 50% reproducible. Suddenly, the application gets stuck and stops. Would like to have this fixed. Also, I have noticed sometimes, it gets blocked in a place for a few seconds probably 1 or 2 which always doesn't end up in an ANR but yes there is a big issue in this that the app crashes frequently",
            "This game is great i used to play it a while back and i recently started to get back into it, one main issue thats REALLY ticking me off is the nonstop crashing of the game. I don't remember this being this bad and as i read through the comments on the reports I'm not the only one please do your best to fix this issue",
            "This is a great game, I love supercell but there is a problem for the S9. ( well it happens to me) So I will be playing the game and collecting my crops, then I will put stuff on sale, then I would start to create things. But no matter what I do the game crashes every single time I play it, I know it's not my phone with supercell games because I have clash of clans and it doesn't crash at all. It's only hay day that crashes so supercell please fix this and I will give you a five star review!"

It appears to assume you're logging after a migraine has happened and that they don't last for more than 24 hours when in fact some last for days or even weeks. Additionally it assumes that medications are only used as an abortive measure instead of as maintenance to prevent. Will be seeking an app that better fits my migraine patterns with more in depth tracking abilities.",

It is a little clunky to understand how to customize them, but easy to do once you find out. I like that you can track very easy and the graphs you can get with it. All with the free version!",

This app is EXACTLY what I have needed but never knew existed. It is 100x better, user friendly, has more pinpointed options, and I love the dashboard. Only glitch is active migraines button text is garbled. THANK YOU FOR THIS AWESOME APP! 5*s!",
            "I've been using the app for a few weeks now, just long enough to start getting feedback from it on my migraine trends. It's fairly easy to use. I would really like to be able to record headaches while offline, but I've had no success with that. Editing the pain location, medication use, and intensity is also very difficult if not done in real time - part of the reason that offline use would be great.",
            "I needed to track just how many headaches I was getting to try and pin point the triggers. I was very surprised to find I actually had headaches on a daily basis. This also will help my doctors to hopefully assist in getting rid of them",

        "description": "Headaches happen. The good news is there are several simple things you can do to ease the pain without a trip to the doctor or drugstore. Try these tips and get to feeling better fast.\r\n\r\n1. Try a Cold Pack\r\nIf you have a migraine, place a cold pack on your forehead. Ice cubes wrapped in a towel, a bag of frozen peas, or even a cold shower may lessen the pain. Keep the compress on your head for 15 minutes, then take a break for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Use a Heating Pad or Hot Compress\r\nIf you have a tension headache, place a heating pad on your neck or the back of your head. If you have a sinus headache, hold a warm cloth to the area that hurts. A warm shower might also do the trick.\r\n3. Ease Pressure on Your Scalp or Head\r\nIf your ponytail is too tight, it could cause a headache. These \"external compression headaches\" can also be brought on by wearing a hat, headband, or even swimming goggles that are too tight. In one study, women who loosened their hair saw their headache disappear.\r\n\r\n4. Dim the Lights\r\nBright or flickering light, even from your computer screen, can cause migraine headaches. If you’re prone to them, cover your windows with blackout curtains during the day. Wear sunglasses outdoors. You might also add anti-glare screens to your computer and use daylight-spectrum fluorescent bulbs in your light fixtures.\r\n\r\n5. Try Not to Chew\r\nChewing gum can hurt not just your jaw, but your head as well. The same is true for chewing your fingernails, lips, the inside or your cheeks, or handy objects like pens. Avoid crunchy and sticky foods, and make sure you take small bites. If you grind your teeth at night, ask your dentist about a mouth guard. This may curb your early-morning headaches.\r\n\r\n6. Get Some Caffeine\r\nHave some tea, coffee, or something with a little caffeine in it. If you get it early enough, it could ease your headache pain. It can also help over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen, work better. Just don’t drink too much because caffeine withdrawal can cause its own type of headache.\r\n\r\nTOP PICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Practice Relaxation\r\nWhether it’s stretches, yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, learning how to chill out when you’re in the middle of a headache can help with the pain. You might even talk to your doctor about physical therapy if you have muscle spasms in your neck.\r\n\r\n8.Try Massage\r\nYou can do it yourself. A few minutes massaging your neck and temples can help ease a tension headache, which may result from stress.\r\n\r\n9. Take Some Ginger\r\nA small recent study found that taking ginger, in addition to regular, over-the-counter pain medicine, eased pain for people in the ER with migraines. Another found that it worked almost as well as prescription migraine medicine. You can try a supplement or maybe brew some tea.\r\n10. Take medicine in Moderation\r\nPharmacy shelves are stocked with pain relievers for all kinds of headaches. They may work, but to get the most benefit with the least risk, follow the directions on the label and these guidelines:\r\n\r\nChoose liquid over pills. Your body absorbs it faster.\r\nTake painkillers as soon as you feel pain. You’ll likely beat it with a smaller dose.\r\nIf you get sick to your stomach when you get a headache, ask your doctor what might help.\r\nAsk your doctor what to take to avoid a rebound headache -- pain that sets in after a few days of taking pain relievers.\r\nAnd be sure to talk to your doctor about what headache symptoms you should not try to treat at home.",

            "Great app! Nice and simple, great for tracking my bouts of CH. Would be great if you could set custom default values (i.e. my treatment normally is the same and takes the same amount of time so no need to enter it every time) and if there were some more in depth graphs you could create from your data.",
            "Didnt need to use this ap (thank God no cluster headaches with the season change) .only issue I had was the outrageous amount of battery it used (that is the only reason I finally have to delete this app my battery charged all night and in a matter of 5 hours my battery went from 100% down to 40%.I am not tech illiterate, I know to do my phone maintenance and I know to keep programs closed when not using.. it was just this app for some reason. Otherwise cluster headache journals is a smart tool.",
            "No option for demand valve oxygen in treatments. That's my only gripe",
            "I am very disappointed today. I had a first stroke of this year today at 1 a.m. I remembered it was started on March last year. When I opened the history , nothing was there as few days before I factory reset my phone. This is really frustrating. Without online back up to drive it is useless.",
            "New to this. Glad there is something out there to help me keep a diary. My cycle started one week ago and its been hell. The pain tends to go easy on me at about the 3 week mark. Can someone help me me advise on meds. The doctors here just keep sending me in circles. Please and thank you"

            "Good basic app. I need the ability to edit medication and to track possible triggers on pain free days. It would be good to track weather and geographical location automatically. The effect of stress and sleep is difficult to measure. I suggest to track the level of stress and hours of sleep. I would also like to be able to track attacks according to weekday. I would like to get the paid version but do not understand the advantages of doing so. Do you have clinical results of the tests &brainwave treatment.",

            "was promising for awhile, then failed. it no longer keeps track of the data recorded and only measures the air pressure when I open the apps. and yes, my settings are all correct. it has permission to run in the background, and to have my location, etc. etc. etc. I'm disappointed. I've only ever had one (ONE) alert come through notifications since I started using this a couple years ago. and again, yes. the settings are all correct. i use the app to monitor chronic pain, but it's useless now.",
            "Great app, I've always been fascinated by air pressure, no idea why but I've tracked it on the BBC weather for years. Now I have a barometer in my pocket, a log of data and it all plotted on a chart. Minus one star because the notifications bear little resemblance to the recorded data! Like zero use whatsoever it's comical. Update: I now have 6 months of data and my graph is looking rather cluttered. It would be good to archive this data and start again afresh",
            "My migraines can be triggered by weather changes so I paid for the full features, set up My Places and set up Alerts - but the Alerts don't ever come through and they aren't saved anywhere so you can't check. Think I've been sold a lemon. **all fixed, thanks!**",
            "Good barometer app. Does what you want from a barometer. Wish there was a little more customization for the widget. I also want to see the the type of weather that the barometer is at, maybe with an icon.",
            "This app is exactly what I've been looking for!! I purchased the premium to unlock my local places and the pressure reads about .9 too low. Is there an adjustment or calibration that could correct my readings?"

I did like that I could turn off tracking for all the things I don't need to make it quicker and easier to use when I have a migraine, but without being able to track medication, it is of no use to me.",
            "The notes section is horrible. It always says \"something went wrong\" when I try to save my notes. So frustrating, especially after I write and then I cannot save them. How is this supposed to help me when I cannot even go back and read my notes? Notes are really important when trying to track my migraines! I only use this app because of my neurologist. I used migraine buddy app before and never had this issue.",
            "Overall a good app, but there are a few limitations which need to be improved: 1) No capability to track actual mg or # pills taken for preventative or acute medications 2) The \"Get Report\" function doesn't pull in all of the acute medications listed in your profile (for me it pulled in 5 of 11) which defeats the purpose of the report 3) The \"Get Report\" function automatically checks \"Aura\" off for every day you have a migraine and includes \"Menstruation\" even if you aren't tracking that",
            "Very useful app, there are some issues with it that others have mentioned. One quality of life improvement would be to remove the Ok dialogue box after setting a migraine free day. There should be no confirmation dialogue box as the day has a visual colour change.",
            "It's pretty good. The impacts on your day only talks about work so doesn't apply to us retired folks as well. Perhaps some additional descriptors would help. Also my attacks kind of wax and wane throughout their 3to 4 day duration. I hadn't thought of each recurrence as a new attack but I can record them that way I guess. Also I have postdrome that lasts for a day or 2 and would love to be able to track those symptoms, treatments, activities that help etc. Love to have this record!"

        "description": "Up to 90% of the general population reported experiencing headaches at some point in their lives. Headache is a complex phenomenon. Many migraine attacks are caused by stress triggers.

            "Can't enter what time you took medication. Who doesn't need to know that? It's also very slow, like it is syncing after each thing you enter instead of after you've finished an entry. I did like that I could turn off tracking for all the things I don't need to make it quicker and easier to use when I have a migraine, but without being able to track medication, it is of no use to me.",
            "The notes section is horrible. It always says \"something went wrong\" when I try to save my notes. So frustrating, especially after I write and then I cannot save them. How is this supposed to help me when I cannot even go back and read my notes? Notes are really important when trying to track my migraines! I only use this app because of my neurologist. I used migraine buddy app before and never had this issue.",
            "Overall a good app, but there are a few limitations which need to be improved: 1) No capability to track actual mg or # pills taken for preventative or acute medications 2) The \"Get Report\" function doesn't pull in all of the acute medications listed in your profile (for me it pulled in 5 of 11) which defeats the purpose of the report 3) The \"Get Report\" function automatically checks \"Aura\" off for every day you have a migraine and includes \"Menstruation\" even if you aren't tracking that",
            "Very useful app, there are some issues with it that others have mentioned. One quality of life improvement would be to remove the Ok dialogue box after setting a migraine free day. There should be no confirmation dialogue box as the day has a visual colour change.",
            "It's pretty good. The impacts on your day only talks about work so doesn't apply to us retired folks as well. Perhaps some additional descriptors would help. Also my attacks kind of wax and wane throughout their 3to 4 day duration. I hadn't thought of each recurrence as a new attack but I can record them that way I guess. Also I have postdrome that lasts for a day or 2 and would love to be able to track those symptoms, treatments, activities that help etc. Love to have this record!"

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

        "description": "Almost everyone has had a headache. Headache is the most common form of pain. It's a major reason people miss days at work or school or visit the doctor. The most common type of headache is a tension headache. Tension headaches are due to tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp and jaw. They are often related to stress, depression or anxiety. You are more likely to get tension headaches if you work too much, don't get enough sleep, miss meals, or use alcohol. According to Ellen Drexler, MD, director of the headache center at Maimonides Medical Center in New York City, \"Avoidance or management of stress, relaxation exercises, yoga, meditation, and other alternative medicine treatments can certainly be effective for many people, since stress is such a common headache trigger.\" According to guidelines published by the National Headache Foundation (NHF), once you have an accurate headache diagnosis and have been assured that your pain is not related to any other serious condition, your headache treatment can be improved by the addition of alternative therapies. Traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in getting relief from their headaches with alternative techniques. This app is an ultimate solution. This is a Wellness app which you can do it yourself. However one may need Medical or Expert advice for certain protocols. We have protocols for Acupressure, Acupuncture, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Bach Flower Remedy, Color Therapy, Diet and Nutrition, Exercise, Herbal Therapy, Juice Therapy, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Shiastu, Sound Therapy, Tai Chi, TCM, Vitamin Therapy, Yoga, Sujok, Auricular Therapy, Hydrotherapy, Rife Therapy, Visualization, Rekhi, Magnet Therapy. These protocols when used under proper guidance gives more better feeling and as all the protocols are complementary / alternative therapy it comes with no side effects on application.

This app allows you to create your own labels for symptoms, so you can be very specific with tracking your health issues. Also, the app creates a nice graph for visual representation of your symptoms. This app is exactly what i needed.",

Had to read 100+ reviews to find developer comments to learn how to use, how to edit, etc. A \"how to/help\" in the dropdown menu is missing. Also, haven't yet figured out tracking >1 person. I got this to track my kid but would like to add myself. Overall it works well so far. Also, I haven't upgraded. Access to the full version (3day trial) would probably yield more upgrades.

Head trauma is very serious and you should seek medical treatment. You will also notice that the headache could simply be a part of your menstrual cycle, because you are fluctuating in estrogen levels. \r\n\r\nAs for treatment you will be able to take some of the over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen or aspirin. This will help you to get rid of the headache, but you will want to avoid some of your triggers, if you are able to identify them. Things like stress and even particular foods should be avoided in order for you to avoid having a headache. You will also want to seek medical attention if you feel that your headaches are persistent.\r\n\r\nMost of your headaches are going to be nothing at all, however, you will still want to get checked out so that you can avoid having it manifest into something that is very serious. You will need to keep in mind that you will want to keep a headache journal. This way you can identify if you just have some specific trigger. Often your headaches will mean nothing, but it is always safe to jot down what you were doing when you got the headache and rather or not you have anything in common with other headaches. This way you can simply avoid the food or activity that makes you get headaches.",

The Raag Darbari works to relieve my head, however the Raag Ramkali does not. On a side note, some of these sitar tunes remind me of The Beatles Help album where there is a really upbeat sitar tune that always puts me in a good mood. Maybe the sitar has a gift. I wish I understood it more. Anyway, THANK YOU developers for the app and the relief it has brought me. Many thanks!"

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

        "description": "Relieve Migraine Headaches Naturally\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many new migraine headache treatments available that can be both safe and effective. Natural treatments for migraine headaches are usually safer and cheaper than traditional pain medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in many instances they can relieve pain just as well or even better than prescription or non-prescription drugs. The possibility of a negative reaction to a safe and natural migraine headache treatment is still there, but it is less with most natural treatment methods than it is with pain-relieving medications. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery person on the face of the earth is unique. Their body chemistry is different than anyone else’s. One person may find relief from their migraine headaches with one type of treatment while someone else may try that same treatment and find no relief at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo two people will experience the same reaction from the same treatment. But why is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery body is made up of a mixture of chemicals. Every person produces certain chemicals in their body so that they will be able to function at their best. Histamines will increase gastric secretion and dilate the capillaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsulin is secreted by the pancreas and helps regulate the blood sugar levels. Hormones are produced by the body for many different functions. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is produced in response to stress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery body is unique and produces different chemicals in differing amounts. When a person takes aspirin (a chemical) for their migraine headaches it changes the chemical make-up of that person’s body. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou’ve always heard that when two chemicals, in the same amounts, at the same temperature, etc. are mixed together they will cause the same reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat may be true, but when one chemical (such as aspirin) is taken by two separate people their reactions will never be exactly the same because no two people have identical chemicals in their body. One person taking aspirin will not have the same reaction as someone else taking aspirin. And it’s the same with natural migraine headache treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince no two people are identical no two people will respond exactly the same to a treatment method for migraine headaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo just because one migraine headache treatment does not work for one person does not mean it won’t work for your migraine headaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many effective alternatives to taking medications when it comes to relieving migraine headaches. You just have to try one for yourself to see if it will work for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne natural and popular treatment method for migraine headaches is chiropractic care, or chiropractic manipulations. Studies have shown that over 80% of headache patients find some type of relief for their headaches with chiropractic treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd chiropractic treatment has been shown to be extremely safe. Spinal problems cause headaches and when these spinal problems are treated by chiropractors a high percentage of their patients experience relieve from their pain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother natural way to relieve migraine headaches is biofeedback. This is a safe and potentially effective way to eliminate pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiofeedback is not actually a treatment, but a training program designed to help a person develop the ability to control their autonomic (involuntary) nervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctions that are normally automatic in the body, such as blood pressure regulation or heart rate can be controlled voluntarily. This technique makes it possible for a person to control their own heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature or relaxation of their muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s no secret that stress causes muscle tension. And nobody will deny that muscle tension causes pain and headaches. And it’s also a fact that by relaxing this muscle tension, especially in the neck and head, it is possible to relieve the migraine headaches or neck pain that is being caused by the tension.",

            "Content is great... When I can access it. If I pause a recording it is very hard to get out to open again. I have to try repeatedly and don't know if it will work. I've given up and read the transcripts for some things but that doesn't work well for a meditation. Please fix these bugs!",
            "I think this is a brilliant app and my pain is so much more manageable after only a month. My reason for only giving 4 stars is that an awful lot of the work is going back to childhood. I have done years of therapy and I just don't need this so a lot of exercises etc are useless to me. Some brain training exercises and the somatic taking is really helpful... Building new neural pathways.",
            "As a musician, RSI has had a significant effect on me for years and finally now I'm able to play again. The app works on the premise that after the source of pain has healed, the sensation can remain because the brain gets stuck in a pain loop, exacerbated by anxiety and anticipation of the pain. The app is based on valid (and relatively recent) research and I'm delighted to say it has worked for me. Thank you Curable.",
            "Great concept but app needs some fixing I love curable and what they do. The content is great but sometimes my meditations stop playing somewhere half way and it ruins the whole meditation experience. Another thing is sometimes the shortcut for the meditation will stay on my drop-down in which nothing will make it disappear unless I restart my phone. Just a bug I'm assuming hopefully the developers fix this",
            "This app may help you. You will need to be able to tune your body to certain unknown frequencies and believe that the MRI study they refer to was not a flawed study from the start. If you are easily brainwashed this is the app for you. Worth a try if you are in constant pain. Good luck."

Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",

So some frustrated migraine patients have ventured into natural remedies for help within preventing migraine attacks or minimizing their pain once a frustration hits.\r\n\r\nNatural Headache Remedies\r\n\r\nThe good news is that your handful of supplements have proven to be effective in a number regarding small studies. Though supplement makers don’t have some money to do large scale research, smaller studies have convinced some specialists—and many patients—that a few of these alt meds are worth an attempt, especially since they come with a low risk of side consequences. Caveat: Always discuss your treatment with a doctor, and don’t take these products without consulting a doctor in case you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nSome Natural Headache Remedies \r\n\r\nFever-few and Ginger: Fever-few, an herb with a long history of use for migraines, has been combined together with ginger, a known anti-nausea remedy, in a sub lingual tablet named LipiGesic. A recent study, published by Cady, found that 63 percent regarding migraine sufferers using LipiGesic found some relief when compared with 39 percent of those going for a placebo. Of those taking LipGesic, 32 oercent were pain free at two hours following onset of a migraine, when compared with 16 percent of those upon placebo.\r\n\r\n“These are very respectable improvements and certainly worth an attempt, ” Cady said.\r\n\r\nButterbur: Butterbur, another anti-inflammatory herb, has also also been fairly well studied, but for preventing migraine attacks. It’s not really effective for treating an intense migraine once it starts, stated Dr. Frederick Taylor, adjunct professor of neurology with the University of Minnesota. You need to take 75 milligrams twice each day.\r\n\r\nMagnesium: When taken daily, magnesium may help reduce the frequency of migraines. The mineral helps to quiet nerves, which tend to get overexcited throughout a migraine. Some studies have found that migraine sufferers are usually deficient in magnesium. You’ll likely need a lot more than the average multi-vitamin contains or about 400 to 600 milligrams each day. Look for amino acid-chelated magnesium (many brand names contain magnesium oxide, which is not absorbed as well). You may also greatly increase your magnesium by eating dark greens, nuts and seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nFounder & Author\r\nMaximiliano Meza Cruz\r\n\r\nThanks for visiting naturalheadacheremedies.org!\r\n\r\nOn this blog you will find useful information and insights on Natural Headache Remedies .

I would risk waking up the others with the glare from my un-dimmed screen I would pay 10 times over for the pro version.

I turn on the Med setting with the first symptoms and change to Dark mode as they get worse. If you buy the app, there's a super dark mode; I rarely need it, but if you tend to have severe light sensitivity, you'll probably want it. Overall, this is the single best app I've ever gotten.",

        "comments": [
            "I can definitely see the difference in tint of my screen when the filter is on and I like the notification bar widget that lets you control whether the filter is active with a single tap. It also only requires two permissions to draw over other apps and the OS to keep the whole screen changed and it's easy to schedule it to turn on. Although, the filter stops working after awhile and I'm not even sure if the schedule works or not.",
            "Easy to use and toggle. Unlike other apps I've tried, it has the option to keep the on and off option at the top of the notification area so it is always accessible. I also like that it supports more than one intensity of overlay; having options is much nicer than not having options.",
            "Was the best night light filter out there but since I updated to Android 11 it bugs every time I watch a video on full-screen (the filter only covers a square in the center of the screen while two big sides of the screen so not have the filter). Other than that it works well. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars. Also, don't push premium on me every time I turn on the app, allow users to choose \"no, thank you\" instead of \"later\".",
            "Honestly, this is really a good app which helps us prevent the exposure of blue light of the screen for better eye health. But, sometimes all of sudden it stops working, especially when I open some apps like sticky notes, YouTube, VPN, etc, so I have to open this app and turn it on again. Rather inconvenience sometimes. I hope there will be some improvement about it. Thanks in advance :)",
            "Some bugs, like occasional it stops working, and when setting up a new filter it will revert to full brightness during the set up, but potentially this could be one of the best blue filter programs I've tried. I have light or medium on during the day and dark at night. It would be nice to be able to set up a schedule for this. You can set up your own filters too, or adjust the pre-sets to get it how you want it."

        "description": "Millions of people suffer from painful migraines. So, what can you do when an excruciating migraine strikes all of a sudden? Following are some great home remedies for migraine headaches that you can apply quickly and get fast relief.\r\n\r\nA migraine is an acute headache that is extremely painful and can even be a disabling condition for many. Migraines are common among the population as a whole. In the U.S., 18% of women and 6% of men report having had at least one migraine headache in the past year. Migraines affect about 30 million people in the United States. They may occur at any age, but usually begin between the ages of 10 and 40 and may begin to diminish after age 50. Some people experience several migraines a month, while others have only a few migraines throughout their lifetime. Approximately 75% of all migraine sufferers are women.\r\n\r\nSome people complain that visual problems accompany their migraines. These visual symptoms include; bright shimmering lights around objects or at the edges of the field of vision, zigzag lines, wavy images, or hallucinations.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms may include severe pain in the area of the temples, around the eyes or in the back of the head. In addition, migraines may be accompanied by nausea, fatigue or tiredness, and mood changes a day or two preceding the headache.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, migraines appear to run in families. If one of your parents suffered with migraines, there is a good chance that you will get them too.\r\n\r\nSo, what events trigger severe migraines? In most cases, migraines are brought on by the following triggers; stress, anxiety, fatigue, certain medications, alcohol and certain foods. Monosodium glutamate (also know as MSG), is thought to be a factor in the cause of severe migraines for a number of people. MSG is frequent used ingredient in Chinese and Asian cuisine.\r\n\r\nConventional home remedies for migraine headaches focus on trigger avoidance and symptom control. If you find that eating certain foods or situations are frequently followed by a migraine, avoid it in the future. This is common sense, but many people do not make the connection between the two occurrences.\r\n\r\nAnother one of the good home remedies for migraine headaches is moderation in your consumption of alcohol and caffeine. These are common triggers. Home remedies for migraine headaches should also include getting adequate sleep, eating meals at regular intervals, and drinking plenty of fluids. Dehydration is also a very common trigger for severe migraines.\r\n\r\nMassage therapies are often very effective forms of home remedies for migraine headaches. If you feel a migraine coming on, get a massage. Headaches and severe migraines are frequently caused by stress. When you are stressed, your muscles tighten up. A massage works to delicately stretch these tight muscles and help alleviate the accumulated stress in your body. By working the muscles in your neck and shoulders, as well as those at the base of the skull, muscles relax and the discomfort will be eliminated. Ideally, this technique works best if someone else does it for you but, if that is not an option, it is possible to give yourself a neck and head massage. A massage is one my personal favorite home remedies for migraines.\r\n\r\nSome people get some relief by applying either a cold or warm compress to the effected area. Most people report that a cold compress works best, but if that is not effective, try a warm compress.\r\n\r\nAcupressure is also one of the good home remedies for migraine headaches. Like acupuncture, it is a well-known alternative treatment for many medical problems that has been used for thousands of years. To get headache pain relief, squeeze the fleshy area between your thumb and forefinger for at least five minutes for one of the quick remedies for migraines. Many folks also can relieve migraine pain by gently rubbing [using small circular motions] the little indentations just in front of your ears.",

Primary care is the frontline healthcare and primary care physicians are those providing health care delivery at this interface. This app is designed for primary care physicians to be used as a  manual at the point of care delivery - which is the medical consultation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis app also has the following important features :\r\n\r\n1. All the common patterns of presentations for a given symptom is shown\r\n2. Red flags analysis by excluding the common causes\r\n3. Required investigations for a given disease to be diagnosed are shown\r\n4. Short text on management is given\r\n5. Fully integrated with the primary care clinic workflow\r\n6.

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

The time of day is just as important as the date itself and a pretty standard question providers ask when asking patients about their symptoms. I have to keep a time and date log while wearing a heart monitor so they can correlate the two but I don't see how to do that. I will be requesting a refund.",

E.g if you use the app and enter data you have an animal that grows as you enter data every day. Once that animal grows you get another animal or plant or a garden or something that you'd care for while caring for yourself.",

I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

            "Go to mood tracker: depression, bipolar, anxiety, etc. Simple! you can input at any time. 1-10 mood and different tags (sleepy, happy) also create tags. It tracks when you take medicine or drugs. This is the simplest app without losing functionality. Exactly what you want if you are trying to work with a psychiatrist OR manage mental health on your own. (screw moodpath lol)",
            "I love this app for tracking my moods. With bipolar two disorder, I can combine the info I track here with my fitbit sleep tracker data to provide my psychiatrist with a comprehensive look at my progress with respect to hypomanic and depressive episodes. My only complaint is the graphs. I would like to be able to change or customize how I see the data so I can better analyze trends.",
            "Exactly what you would expect it to do. Log your Moods. Edit: I have used it near every day since I downloaded 2 months ago. They say to gain power over your demons, you must name them. If you make it a habit to recognize your feelings and label them, you will feel better. Just taking the time to jot a few things down will help tremendously. I cannot suggest this app enough. And the custom reminders are beautiful. A notification to be mindful for two minutes? I couldn't ask for more.",
            "best app for recording any time of sessions: gym, Studio, study. The best by far.",
            "I love this app because in addition to the default moods and physical aspects, I can add my own that best reflect how I feel. It's in a quick, easy to use, yet sufficiently detailed format. I best love that I can put in my own notes as short or as long as I want. I don't need the complicated graphs I saw in other apps. The simple words that I use to describe myself in this app best meet my needs and allow me to more clearly convey my life to my doctor and counselor."

In such a situation, people do not pay attention to their health and the resultant body becomes the home of small diseases. Even if these diseases seem normal, but take it seriously afterward. Headache is also one of these diseases. Many times the headache gets so high that people start taking up the headache medication. Later these drugs have a bad effect. Therefore, it is better to take medication that home remedies for headache are made. Today in this article we are telling you home remedies for headache and headache.\r\nWhat is headache?\r\nBefore knowing the symptoms of headache, it is important to know what is the headache and what is its symptoms? Headache is the human nervous system i.e. the nervous system and the neck related problems. Usually when you undergo any emotional or physical stress, then this problem appears as a physical reaction. In such a situation, not only the head, but the neck and the back also cause pain. Nowadays the headache is a very common problem, but if the meditation is not given during the time, then this problem can increase.\r\n1. Tension headache\r\n\r\nThis is the most common headache. In this type of headache, the person feels the acute pain on both sides of his head, like someone is pressing the rubber band from both sides. Due to such headaches, neck and shoulder muscles become very tight and feel swollen.\r\nReason: This kind of pain is caused by stress, lack of sleep or injury to the head.\r\nNote: Stress-related headaches can also be exposed to cold air. When the winter comes and the cold air moves or the air comes in contact with the air condition, when the air appears on your neck and head, this condition can also be a headache. Physiotherapy can be quite beneficial in tension headache .\r\n2. Migraine\r\nThe pain in migraine occurs on one side of the head, which is also called alfalfa. In this headache, the patient may have trouble with nausea, vomiting and light. In this, the patient feels pain like sticking something in the head.\r\n\r\nCauses: This headache can be due to the sharp aroma, changes in gold currency, changes in hormones, consumption of alcohol, stress or even loud noise.\r\nNote: Apart from this, this headache is also done with the consumption of certain foods, such as chocolate, dairy products, fruit of groundnut and citrus.\r\n3. Cluster headache\r\nThis type of headache is quite acute and painful. Cluster headaches can occur several times in a day, but do not occur for a long time. Sometimes it starts at any one time, like - if it starts in the morning, then for some time it will be in the morning only. This pain can occur at one side of the head and one eye, because it also affects the nerve of the face.\r\nReason: It can be due to heat, exhaustion, smoking, alcohol intake and more or faster light.",

When headaches reoccur we begin to look beyond the ease of\r\nsymptoms for the root cause. Many times the cause of a headache is stress, muscle\r\nfatigue, spinal alignment, digestion issues, body temperature, lack of oxygen in the\r\nblood stream, dehydration, or a precursory sign of infection just to mention a few. One\r\ncould almost conclude a headache as an early warning device of malfunction within the\r\nhuman machine but then aspirin should merely be considered a temporary fix while\r\ntransitioning through the repair. \r\n\r\nChronic headache often is one of the many symptoms associated with Fibromyalgia but\r\nFibromyalgia seems the mime portraying a spectrum of symptoms as an impressionist\r\nportraying personalities. It is the vast arrays of symptoms that go and come, appear or\r\ndisappear that seem to make Fibromyalgia difficult to diagnose and treat because as a\r\nwhole we are a society that treats the symptoms first; much like taking aspirin for a\r\nheadache.

If you are of the belief that the body was designed to heal itself than you must\r\nalso embrace that the power of the mind is in essence a major factor in that healing. If\r\ncommon sense tells you that a scale equally weighted is considered balanced than\r\nconsideration might be paid that equality between mind and body would symbolize\r\nbeing balanced as an entity of one. \r\n\r\nRelief from the symptoms of Fibromyalgia is a huge progressive step but without\r\nexploring the cause behind the symptoms and effort put forth to elevate or better control\r\nits causes it becomes a vicious circle of painful insanity. \r\n\r\nFrom Pain to Freedom is an eye opening guide to the possibilities of a life free from\r\nthe shackles of Fibromyalgia. Obviously I state “Guide to the possibilities” not a cure to\r\nFibromyalgia. Learning different pain management techniques as well as the triggers\r\nthat entice the painful symptoms could be considered the avoidance of Fibromyalgia\r\nsymptoms and without symptoms or pain----well, you judge the name to that outcome. \r\n\r\nYou will learn the medical side of study into Fibromyalgia as to its suspected onset\r\ncause, diagnoses of prevalent symptoms and symptom and pain management as well as\r\nthe naturopathic method to Fibromyalgia management which takes in an entire\r\nspectrum of all methods not encompassed by modern day medical science. Naturopathic\r\nstudy lends a hand of enlightenment to modern medical science but modern medical\r\nscience is not often as accommodating to the study of naturopathy. Ignorance is closing\r\na blind eye for a blind eye has no advantageous purpose to being closed.",

If<br>common sense tells you that a scale equally weighted is considered balanced than<br>consideration might be paid that equality between mind and body would symbolize<br>being balanced as an entity of one. <br><br>Relief from the symptoms of Fibromyalgia is a huge progressive step but without<br>exploring the cause behind the symptoms and effort put forth to elevate or better control<br>its causes it becomes a vicious circle of painful insanity. <br><br>From Pain to Freedom is an eye opening guide to the possibilities of a life free from<br>the shackles of Fibromyalgia. Obviously I state “Guide to the possibilities” not a cure to<br>Fibromyalgia. Learning different pain management techniques as well as the triggers<br>that entice the painful symptoms could be considered the avoidance of Fibromyalgia<br>symptoms and without symptoms or pain----well, you judge the name to that outcome. <br><br>You will learn the medical side of study into Fibromyalgia as to its suspected onset<br>cause, diagnoses of prevalent symptoms and symptom and pain management as well as<br>the naturopathic method to Fibromyalgia management which takes in an entire<br>spectrum of all methods not encompassed by modern day medical science. Naturopathic<br>study lends a hand of enlightenment to modern medical science but modern medical<br>science is not often as accommodating to the study of naturopathy. Ignorance is closing<br>a blind eye for a blind eye has no advantageous purpose to being closed.",

            "I tried using this app about a year ago, and it was very rigid for being a social app. Other social apps are more encompassing, having a place where you can post to everyone and anyone, others then scroll through the homepage of these posts to easily see who is around & who they relate to. There's usually also a feature to search for friends by age, gender & country which is very helpful in finding someone to comfortably connect with. This app lacks those features as well as private chat. :/",

            "It's a great idea, except you need to be 18 to use it. I'm not sure why since a lot of social media has the age limit at 13 (I'm 16), so I would like to know the reasoning behind it. I was excited to use this app since a lot media seems to cater to adults that suffer from migraines, and I usually can't relate because of that. I thought this would be a great for possibly connecting with others in my age group, but I guess not."

            "I just downloaded this app but I already love it! I love that it doesn't count calories and focuses on the way food makes you feel instead. I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",
            "Paid premium, and didn't recieve. Sending questions and suggestions via email, and Facebook. No answer because they are closed on weekends. This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

It has given me back some hope that my quality of life will improve which is priceless. I'll update the review after a few weeks, maybe even pain free!",

I know I tested the old 10 free sessions & loved them, but was not ready to use the app & now everything change. As well as why can't your app be moved to the sd card? It takes too much space on the internal space when you are low on space. The app keeps crashing because my phone is low on space as there is no way to move it to the SD card."

            "The service is AMAZING! I have no regrets using this app to chat with a doctor for something quick. The reason I knocked 2 stars off though is the AI at the start of EVERY chat. It only lists symptoms and takes you through a very thorough, automated chat session. If you are someone who doesn't know what you're dealing with it would be really useful, however in any case where you know your issues, such as Asthma and you're in need of a simple prescription/refill - it'd be nice to skip it.",
            "These doctors are awesome! They listen to you and help you! I didn't think it was real at first. But I had an ear infection and a doctor wouldn't see me for a month. So I tried this and they called in ear infection meds instantly and they said 3-4 days before your better but I started feeling better in an hour! Excellent app!! Thank You for having this available. Highly recommended!!!",
            "My experience was great!! I'm so glad this worked just like it's promised to. I paid for the service of $19 and was given a receipt through email. After downloading the app I answered some questions about my issue, took maybe 10 minutes, and was then directed to a certified doctor. She asked me a few questions and sent the prescription I needed to the pharmacy of my choice. I called to verify if they'd received it and sure enough it was and being filled. I highly recommend this service!!",
            "Its okay, but it always takes you to worst case scenario. Like I have pain in my ribs. Localized, no fever, no headache, no chills, no sneezing, no coughing, no shortness of breath, wasn't near anyone sick... It told me I either had an upper respiratory or pneumonia. I actually somehow tore the cartilage between the ribs, likely from lifting something too heavy. Bruised ribs wasn't even a suggestion.",
            "Very user friendly simple AI. Very cool AI also asks your symptoms to help diagnose incase one is a closet hypochondriac.suppose one could get a subscription monthly and just see what one might MAYBE could sorta kinda have. If that were the case just saying cause I thought it was superfluous knowing already what I had and what I needed medication for but for real diagnosis there is the option to speak to a dr. And if possible they prescribe a medication for you and send it to your pharmacy"

Keep improving 🥺🥺🥺",

Therefore it comes as no surprise that those affected frequently reach for painkillers. However, this can have serious consequences, because the frequent use of painkillers may result in drug-induced headaches - a true vicious circle!\r\n\r\nAlternative methods are often more effective and efficient for getting rid of the annoying pain of headaches and migraines - especially in the long term! They not only relieve the pain, but also treat the problem at its source. One example is the hypnosis program \"Get Migraine-Free! Headache and migraine relief by Hypnosis\".\r\n\r\n\"Get Migraine-Free!\" is based on the healing power of hypnosis and supports the relaxation process which is particularly essential for the treatment of headaches and migraines. It works like this: your subconsciousness activates your „inner doctor“, the awareness of your own needs raises and you learn to listen to your own rhythm again - with noticeably successful results! \r\n\r\nTension disappears from the blood vessels in your head, irritability diminishes, frustration over the constant pain fades away and exhaustion is replaced by targeted relaxation. Special voice patterns and goal-oriented suggestions lead the psychotherapy practitioner through a visualization process which allows the body and mind to relax. The music developed for this programme promotes the relaxing effects of hypnosis and contributes to the success of the audio program.\r\n\r\nABOUT KIM FLECKENSTEIN\r\n\r\n„Get Migraine-free!“ was designed by well-known German Hypnotherapist Kim Fleckenstein. Kim Fleckenstein is a certified alternative practitioner in psychotherapy, a clinical Hypnotherapist and NLP-Master-Coach. Based in Munich she already published a range of best-selling self-help and hypnosis programs as Apps and MP3s under the label GET ON APPS!. Her unique technique and self experiences have helped to create the special character and heart of her recordings. Together with professional and native speaker Cathy Weber she also publishes her programs in English.\r\n\r\nThis special hypnosis program was developed in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Ralf Herwig according to the latest knowledge of medicine and hypnotherapy. Prof. Dr. Ralf Herwig is Head of the Andrology and Urology Department at the Vienna General Hospital.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET\r\n\r\n• A highly effective 25-Minute professional Hypnosis session using the latest hypnotic and relaxation techniques – suitable for both, beginners and more experienced users.\r\n• The professional and warm voice of Cathy Weber, which leads you into a deep state of relaxation and change.\r\n• A high quality and state of the art recording.\r\n• Professionally composed background music for every program by CSW Music.\r\n• Customize your settings and discover other useful features.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n\r\nDo not listen to this program while operating a motor vehicle or during any other activity that requires your full attention.

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "I like this app. The sleep features are good. But I wish I could edit what sounds are in the audio. For the \"sleep\" audio which is 20 min long, it has a great rhythm that helps me get into a sleep state. But those bird noises end up pulling me back from the sleep state. I find it distracting and I wish I could have that removed from the audio.",
            "It really works, I was a little skeptical in the beginning, I originally used the beats for studying I was having a hard time with memory and focusing and would have tried anything for it to help me with my homework and once I notice I was working I use them for relaxation and sleep and I am even going to start doing research on the extrasensory beats as well...Please try they will really help you!!",
            "Loving this app so far. Had some great meditations with it. Deducting one star though as it keeps running in the background. Even when I properly quit it turns itself back on and I have to go into phone settings and force quit - could this get fixed please as it's a battery drain :/ Update Edit: 5 * now - new update with notification that brings you straight to settings to turn the app off. And the new interface is lovely. Much happier, great app",
            "The app was great until I updated it today... it doesnt even give me the ability to have a favorites list! The set up is horrible!! Harder to use and certain sounds aren't available anymore. Went from 5 stars down to about a 2 star I'd give it now",
            "I love the app. However, after recent update Chakra meditation duration mentioned in the description is 90 min(which the audio too was) but the audio now is 30 min. Can you please check that?"

They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",

When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "It used to be a good game until the last update. Instead of the usual 25 diamonds reward players usually got, now it's only 5 diamonds. The most ridiculous thing is that now you have to watch ads in order to apply lipsticks for every single client. What is this? I've watched ads and paid gems for many of the lipstick colours before but now?? Basically have to repeat all of that but now it seems endless. This game becomes kind of unbearable to play now. Please bring back the older features.",
            "Fantastic and creative game but why so many adds?! Adds are too much, every 30 sec. and they cause the game to lag. Please consider our time too. Recently, I finally paid up for no adds and now my game is locking up constantly. Newest updates cost too much money and you don't win diamonds like we used to in tasks. Not happy with the direction this game has gone. Used to be my favorite fashion game. So, so sad. 2020.",
            "Very wonderful and my favourite game of all.....💐💐🧡 I am playing super stylish from many months . Last year I downloaded this game I reached till level 21 or 18 but the game was hanged it wasn't loading . So I had to delete my favourite game. Then again I wanted to download it this year then I was feeling angry I had to start now from level 1 again!! Then now I have reached level 10 . Please ensure that this game should hang once again !! Please! See to it .. but it is my favourite game!",
            "I love this game so much fun especially since I love fashion games and dancing games the adds are a little crazy but not that bad. It is a lil annoying having that in app purchase add pops up everytime u level up but that's ok I still absolutely love this game no doubt about it. Another thing can u do is make it so ur character has a name please. But no other complaints. :D",
            "Omg where to begin. I've reached level 80 and no longer get any clients and it's hard for me to get any collection. When i tried to install and play other apps recommended from the app itself and decided to uninstall the new game, super stylist got uninstalled as well and i had to start all over again and lost collections i used to have."

Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her.

            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

On top of all that, I recently ran into an issue with it and emailed the developer -- they got back to me right away and had a fix ready in just a few hours! Great app; give it a try and you won't be disappointed! Now, back to sleep...",
            "Nice app with a lot of excellent quality sounds. The price is reasonable and not subscription based--unlike many other, similar applications. I had a problem with a full page ad that popped up and did not have the usual X to close it--at least I didn't see it where it usually is. Since that really wasn't the developer's fault and he responded promptly to what happened, I decided to give the app another try and I ended up purchasing it. One thing I would like to see added is to have an option on some of the sounds to adjust how often they play. For example, it would be nice to hear the train sound but less frequently. Very few apps allow this unfortunately.",
            "Before I started using this app I used a loud fan to focus on, this is so much more relaxing and soothing, I just love it, I'm so happy I decided to buy this app. I'm happy but calm lol you'll love it@",
            "I downloaded the free version of this app years ago along with a bunch of others to try and find the best realistic rain sound. This one is bar far the best and most versatile, and I have since upgraded to the premium version which is even better. You can layer up to 10 different sounds and create such atmospheric and relaxing combinations. The premium version also transferred automatically to my new phone which is a bonus. I link it to my echo dot at night to help me sleep.",

PMR is a - scientifically proven - very effective relaxation method. It is recommended by doctors and therapists for many symptoms that are mostly stress-related, such as:\r\n\r\n• tensions\r\n• migraine or headache\r\n• inner unrest\r\n• sleep disorders\r\n• back pain / pain\r\n• states of excitement,\r\n• anxiety and panic attacks\r\n• high blood pressure\r\n• psychosomatic complaints\r\n• burnout \r\n• stress and much more\r\n\r\nWith regular practice, you will always find it easier to get into deeper states of relaxation. Once you have enough practice with the long form of PMR (Basic Form: 17 Muscle Groups), you can switch to the short forms with 7 and 4 muscle groups and finally to the Mental form: Body Scan. Then you can relax your body even mentally.\r\n\r\nALL COMMON 4 FORMS OF PMR\r\n• Basic Form (17 muscle groups)\r\n• Short Form I (7 muscle groups)\r\n• Short Form II (4 muscle groups)\r\n• Mental Form (Body Scan) \r\nfor Beginner, Advanced and Experienced are taught and practiced in this app.\r\n\r\nBASIC FORM: 17 MUSCLE GROUPS\r\n1. Right hand and forearm\r\n2. Right upper arm\r\n3. Left hand and forearm\r\n4. Left upper arm\r\n5. Forehead\r\n6. Upper cheek part and nose\r\n7. Lower cheek part and jaw\r\n8. Neck\r\n9.

Right foot\r\n15, 16, 17 (-> left side)\r\n\r\nSHORT FORM I: 7 MUSCLE GROUPS\r\n1. Right hand, forearm, and upper arm\r\n2. Left hand, forearm and upper arm\r\n3. Forehead, cheek part, nose and jaw\r\n4. Neck\r\n5. Chest, shoulders, back, abdominal, buttocks and pelvic floor\r\n6. Right thigh, lower leg and foot\r\n7.

Chest, shoulders, back, abdominal, buttocks and pelvic floor\r\n4. Both thighs, lower legs and feet\r\n\r\nMENTAL FORM: BODY SCAN\r\nGuided relaxation through the whole body, starting from the head to the feet. This guide is the last stage of the PMR, in which the perception is directed to individual parts of the body without tensing them. The relaxation is now only mental. Soothing imaginations will help you.\r\n\r\nMUSIC TRACKS & NATURE SOUNDS\r\nFor all exercises, you can select among 5 relaxation music tracks and 22 nature sounds. The volume can be adjusted individually. If desired, the music & sounds can also be used without voice to relax or fall asleep.\r\n\r\nFOR SLEEPING OR RELAXING\r\nAll exercises can be used to fall asleep or to relax.\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TENSION & PAUSES FOR RELAXATION\r\nSet your preferred duration of tension and relaxation between the muscle groups.\r\n\r\nTIMER FUNCTION\r\nAfter the end of the exercise an unlimited time for the music / sounds can be set so that the soft music / sounds will deepen your relaxation. \r\n\r\nIn very rare cases (may be: Galaxy S6)\r\nIf there are any sound issues in standby (timeout), please use the KeepScreenOn mode. This is initially preset and can (should) be disabled, if not needed.\r\n\r\nLISTEN TO A COMPLETE AUDIO SAMPLE\r\nA complete audio sample of the entire exercise \"Basic Form\" with 17 muscle groups (Beginner status) is available with the app's default settings on YouTube - 27 min:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iJe_5sZ_iM",

None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different. Plunge into a whole series of adventures, going down into the city subway, traveling to the mountains and national parks on the edge of the city, and venturing through the wasteland, all while shooting your way through hordes of the walking dead.\r\n\r\nRPG AND SURVIVAL\r\nPrey Day is one of the most dangerous zombie survival games full of players who may have different goals and methods of survival - run, shoot, defend, team up, target, and fight real players fighting for survival just like you. Shooting games challenge your skill, speed, and reaction time, and when you're fighting for survival, you'll do everything you can not to die.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "First of all, I frickin love the aesthetics!! I love foxes so much and the layout is just- <3 The sounds are amazing and once I get something hooked up I'll get the other sounds! I'm especially fond of the ones that have to do with water... I'm weird, lol. I hope there are more sounds added soon!!! I am not deleting this app for a long while, it helps me to sleep!! I totally recommend :3 Sounds of nature comfort me. This is the best app I've come across so far! Say goodbye to the fan in my room! Again, totally recommend!!! Go at it, person who made this app! I support your project whole heartedly!",
            "Very good but it can be improve by adding more sound of nature, Like some soft sweet birds tone. The piano🎹 tones are nice, I suggest cool guitar🎸 tones should be included in the next update so as to best complete it usage for all age categories. Once these are included, this app will be the highest rated and downloaded of its kind. One more advice from me is that once your aim is achieved, don't let much advert to downgrade your stars, 🌟 I wish you the very best of luck.",
            "A very lovely app!! I'm quite wary about giving apps certain permissions, but this one has very much gained my trust. It's has zero ads and plays while the screen is off. It uses free audio, so some of it may not be of the highest quality, but I still personally find it wonderful, as it can play in the background while using other apps. And of course the blue light reducing festure is fantastic and has saved my eyes lmao. Overall this is a wonderful app! 10/10 would recommend. 💖💕💕",
            "No ads, wonderful sounds and music, background changes, blue light filters... what more do you want? Hands down helps me sleep. Accidentally leave it on? It stays on all night. That, personally, is amazing. I'm so happy with this, and you should get it! Sweet dreams~🌙",
            "I use this app to help me sleep, and I find it to be very effective, soothing and peaceful. My favourite choice is the ocean waves/tide option. I really like that it plays for the duration of sleep hours, ie 7-8 hours overnight without interruption. I also really like the night light filter option. Thank you for creating and sharing this.

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

        "description": "Migraines are one of the most common neurological disorders experienced by millions of people everyday. This ailment causes severe headaches on one or either side of the head, spreading out from the eyes and can last for several days. In some extreme cases, the pain is so severe that it hinders the affected individual from performing tasks or functioning properly.\r\n\r\nThe sad truth is that there is currently no known cure for migraines, but there are a couple of known home remedies for migraines that provide immediate, effective relief. If not to prevent, these remedies can work wonders for you in the onset of a migraine attack, and help steer you away from potentially harmful drugs and medicines. These can trigger side effects, especially if used continuously. What's more, your body may even develop immunity to these medicines, leading to look for new ones. Home remedies are usually inexpensive and generally easy to make, with most ingredients and components being a part of your everyday life.\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective home remedies for migraines is the wet towel. Wet a towel, squeeze the excess liquid, and pop it in the freezer for about 5-7 minutes. When it's cold enough, lay the towel over your eyes and over the top of your head. You will notice that this brings immediate relief, especially to the area around your eyes. Another one of those good home remedies for migraines is getting a scalp massage. You can have this done by a professional massage therapist, or if one is not available at the moment, you can try massaging your own head. Apply gentle, circular strokes to the affected areas to relieve the pain.\r\n\r\nDowload this app to know more.",

            "Great, perfectly functioning app. My review used to be 5 stars, then I noticed they caved like all other app owners and decided to take and sell your data. This app does NOT need precise GPS location nor be able to listen in on my phones microphone. EDIT: Notice the reply does not bother to say WHY they need to know where you are and WHY they need to record you. Liars.",
            "Update - 2 years later, and I still love this app for sleep, studying, and writing! Original post - I love the customization of this app and how easy it is to find new sounds to download. With so many to choose from and try out, there really is something for everyone. I'm not very tech savvy, but even I can create my own combinations of the downloads to get just what I need to help me focus. I rely on this app to help me tune out the rest of the world and concentrate on my projects, and I imagine it can be just as useful for people who wish to meditate, sleep, or just drown out surrounding noises with something more pleasant."

            "I really haven't played it long enough to judge how good it is. I'll need a little longer. Now that I've played more I really enjoy the the variety of games. I would've given you a five but the bonuses are small and that's what draws me to a game. Hi I'm back and starting over my pad had a melt down so I had to clear it. I have some favorite games now but I still find it strange that the bonus`s are so small and at times you get nothing from the free spins. So bonuses are a waste of time.",
            "Very entertaining incredible. Love to play. Best of the best slots. Hard to stop playing. Wonderful. Great. Best slots.whaving lots of fun. makes me happy. Enjoyed. Keep it up. Extremely interesting. wonderful. Captures my attention. wonderful. Makes me happy. Love it. Great. wonderful. Look forward to playing 😊. Great full for the fun. More games please.very entertaining. Lucky to have such a great game. I play every day. Hard to stop. Incredible. Excellent. Fun. wonderful. Fun. FUN. Swell. T",
            "Fun game but glitchy. More often than not, when I attempt to access the \"Winner's Club\" screen, I'm greeted with the message, \"Sorry. There is a temporary issue with Winner's Club. Please try later.\" When that message is the norm, \"temporary\" is a misnomer. This issue has persisted over several updats, hence my reason for deducting two stars (playing over wi-fi with a strong signal and a fast connection)",
            "I've been playing DUC for several years. So addicting! I do have a couple of suggestions: A \"Collect and Send All\" button for gifts. It takes forever to collect gifts each day. It would be helpful if you could tap one button to collect all gifts and also return gifts that were sent to you. An \"Accept All\" button for friend requests. Would be another time saver...could spend more time playing the slots.",
            "I'm just wondering why the old downtown slot has been removed. There has been several new slots added but for the older slots like the old downtown slot game there hasn't been any new ones added like those types for a long time. I like that game and was very disappointed to it see it gone last night. Why was it taken down and will it be put back up, if not I may just remove this app and find another one. Very disappointed 🤔 so for now I am dropping the five star rating to three stars."

            "This game is really fun I have been playing it for a while and I love it. You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwU🥰🤩",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",

            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "This used to be my favorite game, now I downloaded it again and I'm just disappointed, there is no story mode, you can only go a limit in every round till you finish the mission , and where did the story's go , and the record breaking games, and what happend to competitions, and the super silly fun land with the rollercoaster, I'm just disappointed, I hope you can fix it and undo the last 10 updates, and go back to the original game, cuz this one sucks. Very sadly uninstalling.🥺😩",
            "Game is enjoyable but once you complete all the levels you can't progress further. Also there should be a proper character categorisation . There are only 3 types of characters; common ,rare and epic. But some characters can be found by special missions . So they should be categorised under legendary or exclusive . Further there should be new rooms and new powerups for minions.",
            "I have given up trying to play it. 5 updates later and still no resolution to my loading issues, and I see from other comments I am not alone. Shame as otherwise it was for me one of the best games. Edit: thank you for your answer but it still doesn't work. Not sure of my Player ID as I can't get into the game, after the initial video it gets stuck on downloading 0mb of 0mb 🤷🏽",
            "great game but wow ive had problems. they have this new update and now i cant play anymore it just says downloading. for a week. i contacted help got a ticket but no fix. and then years ago i played this spent a ton of money but my progress wasnt saved. now it says i should be able to get my current progress back thru fb but i have my doubts since I cant even get into the game at all. so great game but dont play. edit: weeks later and still nothing from help customer assistance. Edit: better now",
            "Honestly, im rating this game 4 stars, all the progress i made in the good ole days of Minion Rush in the Story Mode was lost, and i genuinly miss that satisfaction of passing levels and seeing that a new part of the lab gets made and unlocked by filling up the containers with jelly, honestly, its easier to get minions now compared to before and currency is WAY easier to obtain compared to before, all that its missing for me is that story mode it had before, but still, this is a great game!"

            "Works well, with many useful options. It's just too bad it covers the whole screen, hiding what you're trying to dim. You must then keep opening it from Notifications (also hiding the screen), tapping \"darker/lighter\", and returning to see if you have the brightness you want. That's tedious. Better idea: When you adjust brightness (always using a slider, not buttons), reveal the rest of the screen. (The \"Start\" button also seems unnecessary—when you run the app, you want it to start, right?)",
            "I've used this for a year and is my go-to screen dimmer. But dang, why does it crash everytime? The screen goes back to its normal light and I have to go to the main app everytime that happens—even if it means I'm watching a movie from a site (now I have to check all the captchas again). Please fix this, it's nice really. Just the bugs.",
            "I have this ap on my phone and it works great. Just downloaded to my laptop and it wont launch. I deleted it and redownloaded it. The only screen that seems to be popping up has a big round eyeball saying how this might be the ap for you but it doest move past that. On my phone I have never seen tbat screen",
            "It dims fine, but shaking for disabling does not, that made me uninstall. Because when it autostarts during bright daylight (a reboot or empty battery), my screen is too dark. I can't see my screen so I can't disable it. Until I'm in a darker environment. Or create one (looking silly with a t-shirt around my head and phone.) Perhaps a working \"shake to disable\" would persuade me to reinstall.",
            "i've been using this app for years and it's very helpful! my phone screen always seems to be a bit too bright, even at the dimmest setting, so this helps with my eyes in the dark. it also has a blue light filter on it, if your phone doesn't already come with an app similar installed"

            "Challenging and great pictures. Very clear and interesting photography. Zoom is helpful and pictures don't blur when using it. I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",

I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",

            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",
            "Have had this flashlight app for a while and love it! It does what it's supposed to do, without all the unnecessary extras, no annoying adds, and it doesn't glitch on me. Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",
            "I've been looking for this app off and on for roughly 7 years, now. All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."
