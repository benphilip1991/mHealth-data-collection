Everything, from the sort of life you lived to the relationships you had, is a complete blank.\r\nA young boy named Orion appears in front of you, revealing himself to be a spirit attached to your mind. Under Orion's guidance, you begin the struggle to regain your memories...\r\n\r\nBlunt ∙ Earnest < Heart >\r\nShin (VA: Tetsuya Kakihara)\r\nYour childhood friend and current boyfriend. He is only 18 years old, but has a very serious and cold demeanor that frequently causes conflicts with others his age. Oftentimes, he appears aloof and indifferent, but he is actually very affectionate and cares deeply for you. He is a senior in high school, and is currently preparing for university entrance exams. He is also Toma's childhood friend. \r\n\r\nAlluring ∙ Fascinating < Spade >\r\nIkki (VA: Kisho Taniyama)\r\nIkki has a unique condition that causes women to become enamored with him upon sight. He is 22 years old and is currently enrolled in a nearby university. Having given up on a genuine relationship, he lives the life of a playboy, indulging in the transient pleasures it brings. However, he becomes very close to you after he discovers his “eyes” have no effect on your emotions toward him. Despite his looks and popularity, Ikki is really a kind and sincere man. He is a good friend of Kent’s, a graduate student who attends the same university. \r\n\r\nCool ∙ Logical < Clover >\r\nKent (VA: Akira Ishida)\r\nA highly intelligent, 25-year-old mathematics graduate student, Kent sees the world from a purely objective point of view. He is normally very confident in his convictions and in the results of his relentless analysis of others; however, it seems as if he is unable to maintain the same composure when he is around you. His tendency to logically dissect every action makes him a difficult companion, especially among females.  He is a good friend of Ikki’s, who competes with him in solving overly complex math puzzles. \r\n\r\nAffectionate ∙ Intense < Diamond >\r\nToma (VA: Satoshi Hino)\r\nToma is a 20-year-old law student at the university you both attend. Being your oldest friend from childhood, he has naturally assumed the role of your big brother. Toma has always kept an eye on you from a close distance, and takes on the responsibility of caring for you after you collapse on the road outside of your apartment. His desire to protect you is extremely strong, to the point that his mental state can become unpredictable... He is also a childhood friend of Shin’s.\r\n\r\nMysterious ∙ Enigmatic < Joker >\r\nUkyo (VA: Kouki Miyata)\r\nA strange young man who appears unexpectedly. He gives you mysterious warnings, and disappears again without explanation. Whether he wants to protect you or harm you is unclear.\r\n\r\nFriend ∙ Protector\r\nOrion (VA: Yumi Igarashi)\r\nA spirit from a distant world. His outward appearance looks to the human eye as a 10-year-old boy. On his way to run a short errand in the human world, he crashes into you and becomes trapped inside your mind. He supports you in order to fulfill your mutual goal of regaining your memories.\r\n\r\nHow to Play \r\nAfter the opening movie, the title screen will be shown. To play a new game, select “NEW GAME.” To continue your current game, select “CONTINUE.” If you’d like to select another story, select “CHAPTER.”  After clearing the prologue, four different stories will become available.",

            "It is an amazing game, fully voiced, amazing art, and a an enthralling story. It is fairly cheep all things concidered of how much got put into the game! Although, I do wish they put a trigger warning for certain routes though, lots of people could really get scared by it and younger folks may think it is normal and it warp their look on healthy relationships.",
            "It's really good and all, but it tried to make me pay actual money for it. I don't have any money to pay on the game. It's B.s. if you ask me... They shouldn't do that if people have no money for games... I love the graphics and gameplay though. So, those deserve five stars.",
            "Great games are expensive.... I Always liked Japanese visual novels, This one is perfect for Romance genre. But way too expensive, But It's okay.",
            "Was so hyped to play this game but paying ~$3 for every chapter? No thanks. It's cool but frankly not that cool. The characters didn't really grip me enough in the prologue to warrant immediate unavoidable purchases to continue after like. 30 minutes of playing.",
            "I wish I could give this app a better rating because I have heard such good things about it. However I can't because the app will not open. No matter how many times I try to reload it all I get is a black screen."

            "It was nice till this happened, I had just finished reading chapter 7 then I had pressed to play chapter 8 then it said I had no tickets I was disappointed but I accepted it, the. I had pressed out of the information box cause in most apps it'd go out but it didn't I then saw their was a X at the top right of the screen I pressed it then it made me skip to chapters and I can't go back and I do not want to restart the whole book I already know whats gonna happen please help me.",
            "It has changed. Now it includes tickets and gems/diamond system. Uninstalling. New update sucks. You'll lose many fans if you keep doing this. It was good before.",
            "Oh its ended here, I really enjoyed whole storyline.. If you love simple,sweet and intensed story you should play this.",
            "Same as many other reviews. The games should go back to the way it was before update. Update sucks. No fun anymore.",
            "Ok so i really love the game, but theres something wrong with chapter 13. I finally got there and when i try to play it, it gets stuck on the loading screen and when i hit the backspace on my phone, it instantly takes me to an ad and when the ad is over, i get back to the stuck loading screen. It really irritates me because i just wanna read and play it but it's stuck. It might be because im running out of storage on my phone but i dont know."

This game caters to inexperienced mobile players very well. Im on night 11 btw. Good things to add would be a short story plot and another map. But overall very well done.",
            "Great graphics. I'm on the second night and just bacon stripped my underwear! That thing is creepy and fast. It would be better if you were able to leave the bed and explore the house. But after that scare I dont think I would anyway. To quote Shaggy from Scoobie Doo. \"ZOINKS!!!\"",
            "You must play. I nearly peed my pants from jumpscare 😂 😂 😂 Honestly improvements would be-1) new map 2) torch lasts a slight longer or battery refill slight faster. Good game. Damn that's scary!",

            "I love this game so much I love how you can change the character when ever you want,yes you probably would have to watch an ad but in all the other live story games you cant change your character for free. There is so many different love interests in the game although when I was trying to go onto a new chapter it freezed and wouldnt let me play it but I emailed them and they sorted it out in less then a day. best story game ever I would hightly recommend",
            "It's really great! I love how it doesn't use tickets or diamonds!! But the constant ads, are really annoying! But otherwise, it's reslly great! The animation is wonderful! Nothing like the other games I've played! I also love how different choices doesn't cost money or diamonds!!",

That's not fair and that makes me don't like it like outfit cost 8 and 16 diamonds and I get only one diamond at end of chapter and when it comes to spend diamonds on some decisions it gives me anxiety...... Worst one ever..... 👎👎👎👎",

            "It's very interesting and loving. But i have a little bit problem. It's not very easy for me to get to the next levels. It's like you have to go through some difficult procedures before you can get there. And there's no enough diamonds too. Please fix this. We need to get enough diamonds in order to get the best and interesting answers and reply.",
            "Can't explain my feelings for the person who make this! It's just amazing just amazing but one thing I don't like that others might say you that you have to look stunning in front of others but they didn't change their clothes that's really annoying. I love the people's who make this game I played all of games you guys made and all are just amazing every game is more better than next one....",
            "Loved the story so much but the buying aspect was making me uncomfortable but in all I love the story and the ending. But feel too lonely, I pray I one day find someone who will make me laugh again"

            "I love this game because it reminds me of my old RPG game. This game is great because it has CGs which represent certain scenes that can be replayed, full voice acting, and of course background musics. I love Saito and I choose him. His story, so far, is both heroic and dramatic. Hopefully, in the future, there will be a 'Hakuoki Fighting Game'. ^.^",
            "I thought this game was absolutely stunning, the art, the music, attention to detail, there were very very few mistakes in translation which is amazing! I didn't get any of the official endings, but I did get the one with Kazama, and it was actually really cute? The story line was amazing, Everything was so beautifully done. Props to every single person who worked on this, they deserve it! Thanks for the amazing game! I wish the companies who worked on this the best of wishes! -Sincerely Beffey",
            "Really nice looking game. Great story. But i refuse to pay $3 per chapter for it.",
            "Not really free: pay per chapter. Around $15 for a story line or $23 for Premium app. Either way, too much for a 10 years old game port. Really nice controls. I like that it has an affection meter, but not sure how that works with purchases. Can't judge story, only the prologue I read, and it kind of failed at showcasing the characters. It was obviously thought as a full game were you slowly get to know them and find their routes, not one where you immediately have to choose which route to buy.",
            "I absolutely love this and i do understand that you need to make money but having to pay for every chapter is really upsetting. Is it not possible to have to pay for certain things and get the chapters for free instead? Genuinely curious here. The visuals are stunnig and its well made from the one chapter that i saw but. ya. I feel like it would be better if you guys didnt make the app free if u have to pay for everything else. Its a little misleading and disappointing when u do find out."

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",
            "One of the Best scary apps in android..but u guys have to do some new challenges or new maps i mean bigger maps ..like if u got 20/20 money u go outside and u keep playing to get a car to run away or somthing like that"

I bought the game on steam so that I could have the whole story unlocked, but the game didnt work (even though my pc meets all requirements). If I buy the scenes, it'll cost a fortune, because there are over 400 scenes. I wish they would just allow whoever wants to buy the full game to do so on mobile.",

            "This game has good story by the way but it can stuck everywhere so, you should keep going for the rest of the game. I probably don't have any problem with this game but it had stucked and after that it didn't open i mean when you have to find ridless that time it stuck there IDK if this happened with everyone or few people's. I waited a long time but it didn't work so, i deleted this game for forever. I might say you should play this game but if you guys can solve then please do 🙏 I don't know",

            "I really like the game but there is a MAJOR PROBLEM: All. The. Talking. One time, I got so tired of it all, that I just kept of skipping all the talking, just tapping the device for five minutes straight, and I STILL didn't get through all the diologue for that one scene. Delete a few lines from the game, because this is enough to take two stars off my rating.",
            "Its definitely, without a doubt, a 10/10. I first discovered this game when I was 9, I was very fond of diary games at the time, and I stumbled upon The Letter's spinoff and fell absolutely in LOVE with Little Becky's and Ash's story (which is probably why I ship them later on) when I finished the whole game, I found out about The Letter from the ad that they have in the game, and I decided to check it out. Since I was only 9, I waited for 4 years and installed it! Bought it, loved it!",
            "Part 2 please! (Or at least make games similar to this masterpiece!) I have finished the game for like, alot of times already! Experimenting on different endings and working on the characters' relationship with each other. 💓 I'm so glad that I have achieved a good end when I first played it tho. 💓 And I've seriously had mixed emotions when I finished playing it's true ending. 💓 All the characters are great! The girls are my favorite, specially Rebecca 💓",
            "It's pretty good, but the best but I don't regret buying it. Not very scary unless you're paying it alone in the dark at midnight. It gets a bit boring at parts and there's a glitch with kylie in two of the scenes where she's 'possessed' but the pictures are switched which ruins the effect a bit. I just started my second playthrough and i live how different everything is when you make different choices. I look forward to getting everything.",
            "Like the game. Only played the first chapter, because I don't have money to pay for this game. From what I did see: The writing has some issues. Story has pacing issues, and characters have consistency issues. A character will forget who they are for a second to move the story forward at times. Game is okay, but have to pay around 10 bucks to play this game. Not sure I blame them for this, monetization for a visual novel seems tough. That being said, I give this format 3 stars."

However, they recently implemented a ticket system where you can \"complete tasks\" to be able to read ahead. DO NOT DO THEM THEY DONT WORK. I legit signed up for Disney+ and got nothing in game. Its a waste of your time, money and effort.",
            "The art is amazing and love the voice acting. But I played very little... I uninstalled it because in the beginning of the story Leo was always sending me ads. I know you need to make money, but it was pathetic that everytime he would send me something. Still the biggest reason I uninstalled it was because the button for \"All Eps\" was in front of text. I dislike the layout of the game, it's poorly made... and I could not take out the button in front of the chat. Sorry but I didn't like it...",
            "I just finished episode 13 and I'm really excited! This story makes me so curious and it always leaves me wanting more. And that's what I call a good story! To be honest, I haven't paid anything to play this game, I didn't have to. I can always just watch adds. I usually get mildly infuriated when i see a grammar issue but this time, I'm really calm. As long as I get what they are trying to say it doesn't matter! This game legit is fantastic. I'm looking forward to what is in stoke for me :)",
            "So awesome! I really love Leo's voice 😝 I'm addicted 😳 too bad I can't purchase all episodes. 😔😢 Nonetheless, Leo is INSANE! He's words are poetic at times, like yoh, he is mysterious and sexy (not gonna lie),. The way he looks at you, stares!!! 💙 😍💗 I really love this game and absolutely well done to you for making this game! It's a HIT!!! 💙 He makes me feel REALLY SPECIAL!!! 💝😇🌹🤗💘❣️💞💋",
            "How can you like a game when you can't even play it... The starting eps were really fun and I really wanted to continue but as I'm broke and can't purchase the eps with money had to get the free tickets but then I realized to get em I have to complete some annoying survey that doesn't offer me ticket even after completing em... I really really do want to play it but unfortunately I can't....im really upset (╥﹏╥)"

            "Most important thing: I got thru the entire story and unlocked 2/3 (almost 3/3, I have 50 Affection left for Hansol 😖) special endings ABSOLUTELY FREE. MayMem's not a game that requires money, though if you're not a grinder and/or don't like watching ads for free stuff, it may take you longer to progress. It's got an interesting story, MC is hilarious, and there's a good balance of serious drama and banter with your potential love interests. Very fun otome!",
            "Very creative and well written story. All i can say is: This story game 100% better than 2 other lucydream game : dangerous fellows and heavenly. ( i just finished 3 of them and this story is the best splendid.) Better than in movies drama. I would say this storyline is better than most of K-drama or comedy we have now out there. A shame this is not a drama series. It would be very entertaining if this story is remake in drama form of presentation. I definitely recccomend ths story for all.",
            "Amazing story, well written characters and good ost and gameplay is good. Loved everything about this game. i have played lots of otome game but not a single mobile otome made me cry. This one did. Lucy Dream did an amzing job in this one. Hope we get more games with such an well written plot and character like this. Good job Lucy dream.",
            "I really enjoyed playing this game! I like the length of the chapters. Just enough for a study break. The energy recharge upgrade rates in the shop are also fairly reasonable, and I like that it doesn't take much to farm gems as well. What I enjoyed the most was the ART. It's so good! I'll reread chapters just to look at the art again. The banter between the characters is also a major plus! Took me a while to get the purpose of missions tho.",
            "This is an interesting game. It has all what I like about otome game. The characters are not too shallow and the plot is centered in mysteries (which I love). Edit: this game is great. I would recommend it to those who seeks better quality otome games and those who love a well-thought plots and nice character developments."

The previous games you made never ever required wifi. If you guys could go back to the way you used to design games, it wouodve been so much better. Im so upset since this was my favourite game channel on playstore.",

            "You've gotta be kidding me I have to wait 6 days for the next chapter, but I get what are you trying to do by this way you gonna make the readers pay money to get the coins in the game so they can move to the next chapter easily 👏👏👏👏👏wow great, good luck with that 🙂"

            "This game is based on an AP system but it's terrible. You get 500 AP which appears 2 be higher then some other games, but it's actually less. Every tap on the screen u lose 20 AP, basically u only get +25 sentences. This also is skimped cause the game always starts you about 2 - 3 sentences backwards. U can get more AP from 1 Ad for 60 AP which is only +3 taps. Also, the navigation sux, if u watch the ad vid, you get locked into a replenish screen and u have 2 close the game an reopen 2 continue",
            "For people who are giving this game a 1 star: I'm sure you've never played an otome game before because then you would've know that you get 500 coins everyday and you can get 60 coins every 5 hours. The coins aren't the problem at all. The story line is great. It's a great game for people who has patience. If you get through the 2nd chapter, then you'll start to really like the game too",
            "Honestly I REALLY love the story. Its easily one of the best stories ive gotten into BUT... 1. You go thru the AP WAY too fast...if you want to have enough AP to do chunks of the story at a time? Well... 2. The game makes it impossible from a free standpoint. I had the idea of trying to stock up on the 'daily' 500 AP bonus, plus the 60 ap per video but GUESS WHAT- EVERY TIME I LOG BACK IN, THE AP HAS RESET. I end right back with 500 AP. You lose your 'daily' AP EVERY DAY if you DONT USE IT.",
            "The story seems like it COULD be interesting, however it takes a long time to get there with the ap system that is put into place. Its pretty annoying to only be able to collect a few aps a day, and play 1 ad for 60 aps when every sentence is 20 aps! That and you can't just log in and collect your aps for later use so that you can have a longer play time. They just overlap. So say you collect 500 one day and dont use it and then log in thinking you'll have 1000 aps you will still only have 500!",
            "I really love the story. He is almost like me the youngest, can't control himself, always say sorry... I loved the story more than Vladimir's but, I really want to play Ethan's story so badly!"

            "Has this game have any ending? IDK, but , When I enterded room number 999 . I saw there was a puzzle and a hint. But, I don't know even what will be the answer of the puzzle ? so, I enterded the room number 419 and some eyes started to appear on the wall and there was a sound started to come from the door and the whole screen became black and there is writen that \"GAME OVER\" THIS GAME WAS TOO CHALENGING. I love this game.",
            "Didn't get anything of the story, never died once except the soft lock room. The monster appeared thrice and vanished within seconds. What did I just waste my time on. Would not recommend, super boring, the story is not at all detailed, only tried it because of the low size of the game, but now I know why because the game has absolutely nothing in it, Just keeping walking left to right.",
            "It started out interesting with the notes but got pretty boring when you couldn't speed up the walking back and forth. The one time the creature jumps out was good tho! So 3 stars, I would have gave it 4 if you could walk faster and 5 stars if u had some eerie background music and more room design. Otherwise not too bad 🙃",
            "Great, game offline no ads but, one thing is it is alot of back and forth from room to room. Including floor to floor you really have to look tap around the screen. Another is I wish it was more to the story it's a very great plot but, I feel it deserves a little more entanglement if you know but great game👌"

            "The characters and the storyline is good, my only complains are the AP and the coins. It's too difficult to get some AP and coins. My suggestion is you should give the players a daily log in bonus like 100 AP or 50 coins per day. 20 AP per day is not enough and the mini games isn't even that helpful. If you don't improve this game you will lost alot of players. You should mind that not everyone is willing to spend some real money in games. If you improve the game, I will give you 5 stars.",
            "This game would've been so much better if it wasn't for how little coins and PA we get every day. Increase the number of daily rewards. Make it at least 50 coins and 100PA per day.",
            "I remember enjoying this game when I played it when I was 13 or something. But the action points got progressively more annoying... Back then, when there was only highschool life, you needed action points to move locations. Which was sometimes annoying, because you would end up searching for the person for 5 days sometimes. Now, even PROGRESSING THE DIALOGUE USES ACTION POINTS, which is really annoying because you lose track quite quickly throughout the days WASN'T GREAT BEFORE, NOT WORTH IT NOW",
            "It's a good game and very entertaining. But characters randomly pop up to drain action points which is annoying when we get so few action points to begin with. If there was a way to watch ads for action points I would really appreciate it because I cant afford to buy a bunch of action points",
            "I have played for years and the story and characters are amazing, however like many other players it does upset me that we only get 20 ap per day making it really difficult to motivate myself to get on everyday and play for just a bit, also I like others do not have that much money to spend on games, I really love this game and I know that I can log in everyday and not play and keep getting ap but it is really tiring to have to wait to really enjoy it. Please take this into consideration"

            "It starts off good. Scary, and decent albeit easy puzzles. My other gripes in the beginning are it's easy to avoid enemies, there aren't enough of them, and the lack of enemy variety. After a certain point, the game just becomes an interactive movie with a few mostly weak puzzles thrown in. If you aren't into the story at this point, it's tedious. The story is, however, creatively and artistically expressed in many details. It's a good game if you enjoy stories over gameplay.",
            "It was like I was in it every time the game switched characters and like wowwww the ending just hit me different that any other horror game it just I had no words to Express the way I felt so please if you have more games like this keep it up your doing a awesome job at making these games thank you for the experience .",
            "Intriguing and intense! Starts off as a seemingly paranormal horror that turns into something more psychological. Amazing graphics and creative use of scenes and storylines. I appreciated the Tawainese history and spiritual side. Puzzles are a mix of straightforward to complex. It's a very heavy game (Maybe borderline depressing to some) I finished with the true ending and it was emotional. The breath-holding double tap parts are inconsistent and awkward, but that's all. Overall, well done!",
            "A true work of art, at first its a bit scary then its a visual novel. It made me cry, with the music, the visuals. I hope they keep creating more games. ♡~",
            "I love the game, really the cutscenes, the gameplay and the Storyline is a masterpiece, the game deserve more than 5 stars, I love that they give you more than one ending, I really recommend to download this game."

It's an amazing game especially considering it's free, for me it just really makes me feel so invested in the story that I want to support the creators and unlock everything there is to achieve in the game lol. Loveable characters and great storylines, totally recommended. ♡",
            "After trying this and a few other otomes, i can safely say this is my favourite. Very beginner friendly. The characters are also extremely lovable, and every individual route is a new experience that allows you to see the different sides of every character, not just your LI, and I think that's brilliant. In any case, this is an easy 5 stars for me. The devs are really nice about game issues too, giving us hourglasses and all. Luv u",
            "Mystic Messenger will always be more than just a love game. The concept is to fall in love but it's like each character you pursue you literally save them from what they were going through. Anyway, this game holds a lot of meaning and you sympathize/empathize with what each character goes through. The amount of times I've legit cried so hard is hard to count. I'll always love MM and Sujin Ri thank you for not giving up on making this game, without it idk what I'd do. 💕 Cheritz ❤.",
            "It is so great that i got emotionally involved with the storyline. Love their characters especially seven and jumin. And i also love saeran for being so precious. The graphics are nice. And the gameplay is actually great except for the real time chatrooms (especially the 3-4 a.m. ones). There is nothing to complain about because overall this game is a gem. (will you add new DLCs tho?)",
            "One of my favourite games. Have been playing and replaying since 2016. Though on coming back to it recently, for some reason none of the videos will load. So miss the beginning and ending Q^Q don't know if it's a problem localised or more people having it. Hope either way it resolves itself soon. Thank you so much for this game 💜"

            "I love this game! But i rated this 4 stars because, this early morning and even until now, i can't get in to the game and it keeps on loading then a pop up will appear and say that there's error and bad connection. I refreshed our wifi, even my phone, as well as turning on and off my phone but it's still the same. I haven't played for a whole day and this has never happened. I don't want to uninstall this because I spent money on this game 😭",
            "I love this game! I know people in other reviews wrote that you can only play one chapter a day, but you bond better with the character that way, also there are five parts to each chapter so chill there's plenty to read. At checkpoints, if u dont get the premium item you still get to read the same story, the only difference is that you dont get to reread it. This app is very well done and the character arcs are flawless. I cant wait for Comte's route to be released!",
            "Overall, it's a great otome game with a unique setting and genuinely interesting characters. My only complaint is that, for some reason, after watching an ad to earn a diamond, the amount of diamonds I have doesn't go up. I'm new to the game, so I don't have many diamonds, but after watching more than 5 ads (today), I've only gotten three diamonds in total from them. It's an odd bug that's pretty annoying, at the least I hope it isn't recurring.",
            "I just started reading & I like the storyline thus far, however it would be much more enjoyable if the chapters were longer, since we only get to read one chapter a day. As with another otome; Honey magazine, you get 3 tickets but it's 1 ticket per chapter & it regenerates 1 ticket every 4 hours. Also bothers me when it flashes back to a previous scene using up slides that could be used to progress the story or start each chapter with the last 8-10 slides of the ending of the previous chapter.",
            "This game is amazing. The only downside is the pricing and how hard it is to earn currency. The prices are really high and it's proven to be difficult to earn coins and diamonds. And ONE diamond per add is really low. Other than that, the story is great and the music is too, it's really enjoyable."

            "Hmmmm... This was Different! Vampires, & \"stories??\" I didn't like the story between every game segment - too much. It was ok for something different, I guess - wouldn't want a steady diet of it, though! Thanx, jan p. Well, when I ended the game, turns out, I LOVED IT!! Very unusual & ended Too abruptly, but it was good. Was looking for a wedding, but it wasn't meant to be, I guess!",
            "I LOVE this game, I just DON'T like being TIMED when I'm trying to find the item's. I've got (epilepsy,& bad eyesight). And i DON'T like using the stars just to continue the game, it's kind of annoying. If you have to give me the stars, give me LOT'S of the star's. I also don't like doing the level's over,& over again. THAT'S (REALLY ANNOYING). And as it goes further, it get's harder. I'm not fond of that eiather. Other than that, i have no other problem with this game. 👍😤😊💗",
            "Ok, so I'm not sure which app was thr original, but there is some MAJOR plagerism going on between this app and one other that I recently installed and played and uninstalled because it was eh. The entire storyline, quotes, dialogue, was WORD FOR WORD. Idk if this app was the one plagerizing or it was the other app, but there's something fishy going on. The only difference was that this app had mini games and the other app had you choose the clothes.",
            "So i finally find a story and game app all rolled into one that doesn't require gems to do fun stuff and I'm loving it but then i get to chapter two and boom it doesn't open any more. They say I've got no \"internet connection\" even if I'm using wifi. I just gave two stars cuz i love the concept of the app. You guys should probably do a rain check or people are gonna loose interest.",
            "It is almost impossible to get to the story. You are doing more games then reading. I don't like that at all. The reason I don't like it is because ( Yoou start to read the chapter and when it gets good you have to play the game. ) Who ever thought about this game didn't put much thought into it."

            "This game would have been a good one if it weren't for greed. You can only play a quarter of each episode per day as you can only have 5 choices per day. It ruins anticipation, and delays the flow. It just wants to lurk on your money (to which I really dont have lol). This can be a good game for those who have money lol. Story is entertaining as it is like a book but better since it is as if you are writing your own. The graphics and sound also helps with the appeal.",
            "Game cheats! I was supppsed to get bonus 120 energy today for logging in days in row except after a few seconds on game it says I'm at 0. That's not even possible! I should have at least 20 left! So the extra bonus energy is a bold face lie! I also collected my energy yesterday but did NOT use it so I could play longer today. Nope game stole that energy from me today! I couldn't use it. POINTLESS game if you can't even play & it cheats! Don't bother you only get a few seconds a day!",
            "It,s a really good game and I feel like I,m actually in Paris, the animation and the music is awsome but the problem is that the energy takes a lot of time to recover and just like other players are saying I would also like to say that it would have been better if the energy would recover a little faster and woulden,t be used so quick, I hope you all will make the change since I,m not the only one complaining.",
            "When I saw the \"I've got a crush on you\" I knew I had to try this cheap copy of choices by ubisoft. They also used a smarter tactic and made all of the choices use energy so you can play 5 to 6 choices maximum and get frustrated each time your energy runs out. Just spend your time on pc games, I don't think anyone needs more games behind a paywall. Google has made sure we have enough of that.",
            "I love this app...... Just love every other episode story brought to life and making my own choices makes it so realistic... I play it everywhere its amazing..... Who woulda thought that reading could be so realistic..... Im used to Just putting images in my head but this is a totally different unexplored reading.... I love it😍😍"

            "I can't use it, because I do not read Spanish. When I change to English, it remains in Spanish, even after restarting and all standard troubleshooting. I paid the $3.49 (U.S.) to unlock all the alternate endings, which is offered prior to loading the screen that begins the game. At this point everything is in English, and it is fully reasonable to expect the content will also ne made available in English. I want my money back immediately or I will report you to Google for fraud.",
            "Every time I make a choice, the device vibrates, even though my volume is down to zero. This is annoying because I read at night and it bothers my partner. Otherwise, a great story, absorbing from the very beginning. Best enjoyed in the original Spanish.😉 Perhaps if you can fix the vibration issue I can change to 5 🌟",
            "I wanted to try interactive books for quite some time and I even bough 1 on Amazon. the sad thing is the app gives 0 explanation on how to link amazon purchase to it and just asks to buy it on Google play. It also always starts with Spanish as a main language no matter how many times you change it.. in the end I was unable to read the book.",
            "It was a nice effort. Very short and no real immersion. I felt like maybe a child/teen wrote it, due to the many syntax errors (that could have been due to a not-so-great translation too, as I think the original story is in spanish.) I was just expecting something different, but it wasn't bad storytelling.",
            "Good story. Best game for me because i choce correct choices at first itself. Others wont be lucky as second time you need to pay for playing."

            "I absolutely LOVE this story and the plot is awesome. Been trying to find visual novels that aren't centered around romance and this definitely fits the bill! I can't give it that last star tho because the grammar and spelling errors are atrocious to the point where I'm sure that English is not the writer's first language. Its fine tho and doesn't bother me that much but that's why I'm going four stars. Plot is great tho! I see it was last updated a long time ago so is chapter 5 still coming????",
            "Just started playing. The writing was too well detailed and that made me lose interest in the game. Don't put that much effort in the writing and limit your words as few as possible. You have to rely on what we imagine instead of giving full out detail because that's what makes novels interesting (full of clarity yet precise) . Every movement of mc does not have to be written out fully. That's all. 😊 By the way, the rest is good👌",
            "Amazing Vn!Most Vn's are usually story based with pretty mediocre character models or romantic and whatever stuff you could come up with, while this one, well imo had some bad character models but THE STORY WAS really good!I loved the wording, was supposed to learn a few words during the lockdown and now i did!All the chapters were amazing, i hope you guys continue working on it and create more masterpieces in the future!(tho sometimes i noticed a few grammatical errors)",

            "I am so angry right now. When I try to complete surveys for coins, there are no matching or available surveys, when I downloaded an app to get coins, I played that game for a while, waited, and when I went to see if I've gotten any coins, all the challenges for that app was suddenly gone and I didn't recieve any coins. This game is so unfair. Game developers should create games everyone can enjoy instead of being so money hungry. Super disappointed.",
            "I DO NOT recommend this game. 1. F2P PLAYERS: GREAT PATIENCE REQUIRED TO PLAY GAME. Game only allows 10 videos (10 coins a day). Just one section of the \"Royal Challenge\" requires from 400 to 900 coins. So to F2P players - it can take you 1 month just to finish 2. ID DIFFICULT TO KEEP Game ID changes with every change of device, so unless you keep very good track of it, you can lose ALL your progress. I kept a screenshot of my ID and PW in multiple places only to realise that it didn't work.",
            "I love this game! So far my favorite charicter is Giles, but if there was something you could add is maybe voices? Like the other games? You guys don't have to, but it would be a great feature. And maybe a more easy way to get coins? They're really hard to get.",
            "This is the worst game with worst graphiks and picture presentation... I don't beleive that I downloaded this game... It might seem nice at the first but it is the worst... The story isn't atractive at all... And it is filled with ads... Even the loading takes a lot of time, as much as you can't imagine... Now I'm gonna delete it... I don't wanna give extra 1mb for this game...😡🤬",
            "This game introduced me to otomes... And a minus bank balance. The stories for MidCin are innocent and light, not to thrilling but the avatar clothes are what stand out on this one. It's probably the cheapest in the series and gives the best offers for gold. I left this game for IkeSen. I did not regret leaving Byron for a warlord ;)"

I seriously have no idea where she upons to be, so I walk out of the bedroom, and BOO there she is! Maybe make it to where she talks, kind of like the game Granny. Other than that, I think it is a pretty cool and SPooKy game!",
            "Cool game! To be honest I didn't expect that this game will gives me a chill,second was I didn't even imagine that it will scare me a bit,the scary zombie like women with a knife chasing you and the scary foot steps that you hear from Her everytime she walks near you.I like also the puzzle type it looks like a SILENT HILL 4 THE ROOM.Anyway I'm glad too that you have a Pet like that black Dog that you have on the game,but sometimes it scares me also everytime that dog pops up on the door.😅",
            "After the new update its not working, I cant open the game and there is no button at the right , its all pitch black , the only thing we can see is (get the best experience with headphones)",
            "It is so nice game i suggest to my friends to play I like to play but on 22/October 2020 it's update was there I updated than its not coming only writing get better experience with headphones I used my headphones than also it is not working pls help and answer me OK and please Why it's happening like this not opening without headphones I like this game if it will do like this I will uninstall it pls do something 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭",
            "Great graphics but the joystick and learning how to move was clunky. I got bored trying to figure out how to navigate."

The characters are well fleshed out, the MC actually has spunk and guts, and her relationship with each love interest grows in a believable, organic way. A truly wonderful game. Only negative comment I have is that each character release takes SO LONG! But every time it's ABSOLUTELY worth the wait! ♥",

            "Seriously this is one of the game I LOVE. The storyline is so good! But I think the cgs can be improve though. Overall, good job for making this great josei game! I hope new story for other characters will be out soon! Can't wait!"

            "Hellow guys, this game is fantastic with the story line and the characters with their voices,the reason I gave it 4 stars is the coin thing, the chapter needs 20 coins , and after all my 200 coins where out (ofcrs I bought clothes)I can watch 4 ads to have 25 coins and I should wait till 10hrs to watch again , but the good thing is you can wait 24 hrs to read it without coins ,tehee niiice, all in all this game is amazing and looove it💓😘",
            "I like the story and plot...it goes great but the problem is how do you collect coins..sometimes videos are not available so that you can get free ones...that's really the worst part and the options for choices and clothes requires coins...how would we do that if we don't even have enough coins...don't expect me to actually use money for something that stupid -.-",
            "I like this app! It cures my boredom. My only complaint is that it takes 24 hours for you to read the next chapter and you can't get coins for free. Oh I have another complaint. Why can't you screenshot from the app? I want to send photos from the app to send to my friends(for fun). It's a great app but I recommend (for the creator of the app) to update the app where you can get coins for free, watching ads to get coins is fine by me and please change the 24 hours wait (idontwannaspend20coins)",
            "I will give this game 5 star because this game is a real fun and when u play this game I feel very happy and very comfortable and one thing u have to change is the coin problem and another the story take 24 to unlock another story and how can we buy every clothes from the story if we only have 200 coins u should me its 10k coins becoz its will help us to now what inside the lock this and make the price low of the lock thing expect the story clothes",
            "It was fun there was luv in air 😍😍😍😘🤩I just wish there were more games with voice overs 😔😔😔😔😔 otherwise I'm happy with the game and how he speaks to you you don't have to read it and it's good for people who can't read ,this game is my first game that I rated five stars👏👏👏😍😍😍😘😘😘😙☺️"

Atmospheric and surreal, Lazaretto offers a glimpse of a bizarre world beyond human consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt’s night. You’re all alone, exploring the terrifying ruins of an abandoned quarantine island. Find and collect mysterious clues along your journey. What happened before this strange island was suddenly closed down? Bits and pieces of forgotten artifacts reveal a dark, dramatic and haunted past. \r\n\r\nThis is only the beginning. You discover unsettling, living nightmares far beyond normal. A mysterious, ghostly seance from the past begs for your participation. Connection with this paranormal world leads to a physical manifestation of the subconscious. Fears and anxieties create a surreal world that you must survive if you want to see another day. You begin to wonder which of these worlds is real and more importantly, which one can you survive.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE & SURVIVE\r\nSet in the current day, you play the descendant of a man who once worked at an old and inactive facility rumored to be located on a haunted quarantine island.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A LAZARETTO?\r\nA lazaretto is the historical name for a quarantine station for maritime travelers. Urban exploration is the investigation of rare, abandoned, man-made ruins and structures.\r\n\r\nMOOD & TENTION\r\nThe eerie and decaying environment coupled with haunting sounds provide an evolving span of contextual tension. You are presented with scenarios ranging from escalating terror to sheer panic.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING HAPPENED HERE…BUT WHAT?\r\nYou are drawn into a forgotten world where a mysterious and dark history is slowly revealed.

            "The game needs more added to it. Navigating is ridiculous.the controls are horrible. Especially when you come across the invisible evil thing that chases you. What are you suppose to do when it chases you. Idk. Games needs work. As for the horror vibe of the game. It's pretty good with the background noises and random ghost apparition a. In all honesty.the there stars come from the horror aspect.",
            "Great gameplay. I didn't expect it to go where it did. No real puzzles in it but fun exploring and no fight mechanisms. Just have to hide and escape. Graphics are pretty good too. Overall, a much better horror game experience than I was expecting. Looking forward to the next chapter.",

            "I Played this game for months and i really loved it but I rate 4stars cuz since the 7-day login disappeared its hard to get crystals and money. Evrerytime I levelup, the cost of healing increases and the upgrade. Everytime I lost I need to heal them agaim and again which cost so much money. Its not hard to get money but battling everyday to get money is getting boring.Maybe dont remove 7day login and increase the money amount of everyday login then I will rate it to 5star.",
            "Simply amazing. The artwork and animatiom is fantastic and the story is quite interesting. You also dont have to wait for to long to continue playing and the battles are increadible ( as i like it simple ). I would recomend this game if you like profesional animation and is lookingfor something to pass time.",
            "Well I allowed all the permissions only to play the game though I can't find why it asked to manage phone calls. But the game wasn't opening. So I allowed all and then some stars were shining on the black screen and nothing else. I really don't know why.",
            "For everyone having the problem that the game won't start (just showing a black screen then closing down): you might need to allow all app permissions! It doesn't ask you to do this like most apps that need it do, but it fixed the issue for me right away. Go to Apps, find the application, go to permissions and slide all of them on. Hope it helps! Like many have said, it's a great game with a fun and witty protagonist, and I've spent many hours enjoying it before.",
            "I've had this game before, and it is absolutely awesome! I love this game a lot! But I tried to redownload it again, and it took a lot longer to install than any of my apps ever have. Once it was downloaded, it refused to even open at all. The screen would come up black like it normally would to start. But it then exits off and says that it cannot open. I really like this game and I'm sad that it's not working. Many others have left comments about the same issue."

            "I appreciate the uniqueness of The Mother and the overall eerie premise. Controls are great too. The eye feature is neat. While it is possible to manuever/run away from her, I wish there were better opportunities to hide safely. Having to constantly go back/forth for objects isn't grand either. And more distinctive step sounds; hard to tell how far or close she is, thus lot's of guessing of her whereabouts. Mixed feelings on the total greyness. Not in love with the game, but not too bad either.",
            "I'll be the first one download this game because of Markiplier. The game is same fun as Granny but this one had lot of potential. The design is really good along with the story! But this game is more sense than granny because you play as a child and you want to escape from evil mother that want feed her live doll with your meat. What i need is please put more jumpscare when you get catch alive or put animation on doll that move for second when you enter the room. That will give player creep ❤️",
            "Potential but sum things are missing like a flashlight some places are too dark,why show that on the screenshot if there's none.Player death is too boring no screams no nothing not even a sound of Mother when she attacks quite too simple and dull.Background music too soft even when it's maximum.Controls are ok graphics could improve.",

            "In in increasingly crowded genre, this was is just OK. I hated the story the app forced me into when I first launched it, but some of the others are mildly entertaining. If you are bored, this might be worth a spin. The graphics are mostly decent, except when your character is supposed to be embarrassed, and then they paste another characters face over yours, which looks ridiculously awful. The dialog is sometimes awkward and cringey. Some of the stories don't seem to have many meaningful choices. This app needs a lot of work. Edit: Going to give it another star. Some of the stories are pretty good. I love that they have a strong character in a wheelchair.",
            "such an amazing app truley sexy. The only thing that I would change is the amount of exposure. When the characters are nude, you can only see above the waist fot the men and depending on the story you are doing, the girls either are wearing a bra or they crop out just above their nipples. So you can't get the FULL experiance.",
            "Love these stories, need to make more LGBT options though and more ways to earn free gems. Stories are fun. Hate that it doesn't work when try to play sometimes",

            "It's one of the interesting stories I play yh, I like it...I'm just not impressed with the ticket issues and the time frame it takes to reach the next chapter....you can't shop for tickets you wait for the next day, it makes the interval between the player and the game super wide... I hopefully expect you guys to do something about it to make it the most interesting Allright??.....but trust me apart from these, i think the game's interesting , so thumbs up!!",
            "Damn bad.....am not at all getting my daily rewards...they are doing nothing but tricking us to buy the tickets by not providing the daily rewards...and there is no reply to the problem as well. I better report this game",
            "Love the game but i hate that we must wait each day for a ticket.please put videos we can watch to earn tickets please",
            "I wish we can get 2 tickets each day. I really love the story and the characters.",
            "Thumbs up to this app, this is one of the best interactive games that I have ever downloaded. This app is just superb😊😊😊"

I don't know if it's a bug or just my phone but if this can be fixed by the dev I would really appreciate it, or if the game could automatically save so I could get my progress back after restarting the app. Otherwise I highly recommend maybe it'll work better on other devices.",

So much my heart filled with amazing emotions while playing.. and frankly the controls, graphics, storyline is amazing!! but it was too shorte story is a little short and did not show some important events like when you choose who you will be with.. There will be one broken I was hoping I could talk with tsuka.. evething went smoothly an it did not have to make so much download to continue the game..",
            "Great game. I absolutely fell in love with the characters and the romance was just my type. You can finish this game in a day which is something I like because you dont have to wait to read the next chapter, and you dont have to have coins or anything like that to get a good story. The only down side is that it was a pretty plain story but I still enjoyed it none the less",
            "It's the best time game I've played not like the ones in which I have to wait until 12 am passes and gets tickets...and sometimes after a week which is super annoying if I say.....this was the best and I literally finished it on the day I just downloaded it.....Thank You for this..",
            "I loved this game.... Both of the guys storyline was great! Even though I was first compelled to be with my childhood bestie.... I just want that you guys make a second part of this soon. The story about what happened in our lives.... Thanks again for making such an amazing game. In my opinion 5 stars are even less for rating it. It surely was heart touching.... If you have made any second part of this game.... Please tell me!",
            "To anyone who's scrolling done the comment to see if this game is worth it, JUST DOWNLOAD DA APP ALREADY!There's no need to scroll in the comments cuz dis game is totally great for ppl (like me) who wants an otome app for free. There r not much of ads and r completely free of charge, which makes me feel utterly happy with da maker of dis game. So I'm givin dis app five ⭐ because it totally deserves it. I really wanna thank da maker of dis game, cuz this game rlly made my day. So thx!"

I would give it five stars but for some reason every time I play I get stuck spinning and can't move and I have to completely restart. I don't know if it's a bug or just my phone but if this can be fixed by the dev I would really appreciate it, or if the game could automatically save so I could get my progress back after restarting the app. Otherwise I highly recommend maybe it'll work better on other devices.",

            "Omg!!! Soo freaking great I hope there will be a continuation of the game I loved it!!! So much my heart filled with amazing emotions while playing.. and frankly the controls, graphics, storyline is amazing!! but it was too shorte story is a little short and did not show some important events like when you choose who you will be with.. There will be one broken I was hoping I could talk with tsuka.. evething went smoothly an it did not have to make so much download to continue the game..",
            "Great game. I absolutely fell in love with the characters and the romance was just my type. You can finish this game in a day which is something I like because you dont have to wait to read the next chapter, and you dont have to have coins or anything like that to get a good story. The only down side is that it was a pretty plain story but I still enjoyed it none the less",
            "It's the best time game I've played not like the ones in which I have to wait until 12 am passes and gets tickets...and sometimes after a week which is super annoying if I say.....this was the best and I literally finished it on the day I just downloaded it.....Thank You for this..",
            "I loved this game.... Both of the guys storyline was great! Even though I was first compelled to be with my childhood bestie.... I just want that you guys make a second part of this soon. The story about what happened in our lives.... Thanks again for making such an amazing game. In my opinion 5 stars are even less for rating it. It surely was heart touching.... If you have made any second part of this game.... Please tell me!",
            "To anyone who's scrolling done the comment to see if this game is worth it, JUST DOWNLOAD DA APP ALREADY!There's no need to scroll in the comments cuz dis game is totally great for ppl (like me) who wants an otome app for free. There r not much of ads and r completely free of charge, which makes me feel utterly happy with da maker of dis game. So I'm givin dis app five ⭐ because it totally deserves it. I really wanna thank da maker of dis game, cuz this game rlly made my day. So thx!"

            "I like it. The story is good, tho somewhat childish. I would like it more if I was a teenager. But cute and I like that it is free. I can watch an ad instead of waiting until for the nxt chapter.",
            "I've read the first story which is cute. I like all the different outfits and it's nice not having to pay for choices. However, it's irritating that regardless of what you choose the story will just overwrite your decision which feels like your choices have no bearing on the game outcome except which twin brother you end up with which is a very limited and uninspired outcome",
            "Love how you don't have to pay for choices, but the amount of ad's is horrendous and the grammar is terrible. I would also like way more customization options for the main character bc the hair and outfit options are extremely limited, and you can't change the MC's face, which I find frustrating. Also, 'our' reactions to things are super immature and it's really annoying bc most of the time I can't change them. The storyline isn't terrible but there's definitely room for improvement. 4/5 stars",
            "The story is very cute, if a little predictable. I just wish the choices would actually matter in the way the story goes, but the truth is, it doesn't, and that is the only reason I give it 4 stars. Other than that, a nice experience. The art is sweet, you can change the physical details of your character any time you want with zero costs. There is room for improvement, but overall, enjoyable.",
            "I love this game .....I love that you get to choose between two handsome looking twin brothers....the only thing I don't like is that you have to wait for quite a while to open a new chapter....but other than that it is a wonderful game ......thank you very much for uploding this game that's why I am giving you a full five star rating for awsomeness😘😘😘😘"

Reversing to the opposite directions, lagging etc The efforts are beyond appreciated, just a shame that improvements have been limited.",

I like the devs speedy and professional response to address the issues & reviewers critique; movement and controls are heaps better now with the update. I'm definitely enjoying this! If you're after quality horror give this a go!",

            "Poor handling, lazy sound design and a visual rip-off of Limbo take away from the innovative gameplay elements. Disproportionately fast movement of the character comes after a lag. The jump responsiveness is not the same as the movement controls. Needs a consistent design language, such as texture of the edges, character and special elements. Simple, rewarding, relevant mood creating sound, consistently responsive controls would improve this game which has potential of being captivating.",
            "Ux absolutely horrible. I don't understand what the problem with implementing experience friendly controllers except developers had some super deep idea how to spend time for a kinda nise graphic even if this game pretty much similar to limbo, but screwing the whole experience with silly controls. And ads, it's just wonderful. Uninstalling.",
            "Great game however the ads are over zealous. Die, ad, next level, ad, choose a level, ad. I'd rather have an option to buy an adless version. The controls are a bit finicky. Slide forward and she goes backwards, finger right on the jump and she doesnt. Considering theres ads after dying, this creates incentive for \"glitches\" or \"errors\" to occur for you to die a few times to advertise to you.",
            "For a Limbo rip-off it's still pretty fun and creative, if glitchy. I'm pretty sure 4-6 is broken because jumping isn't consistent with how high you can jump, which is frustrating since I'm so close to finishing the game but the last level is impossible with the glitch.",
            "I cant even start to play the game. Less than 5 seconds after tapping the app to open it, it forcibly closes and does that regardless of any fixes I try including unistalling and reinstalling. Uninstalled for good from now on"

The length of each chapter is not equally distributed. It became shorter in each chapter (less 1 star). The longest chapters were chapter 2 and 3. I finish chapter 5 in just 2 mins with no effort at all! Lol",

            "If your a fan of Silent Hill or the like, you should enjoy this one. The controls add a bit to the anxiety level for me, but I'm awkward with non-keyboard controllers. I would imagine that the controls are as good as it gets, without an external device. This can be played offline/without connection, which is a big plus. The sound, graphics, and gameplay are good. The voiceover is well done. This is one of my better game purchases.",

But i just wish you could add a pictur of your self and the game automatic designes a character for you in the game style so it is easyer to see the bigger picture because not every one can imagine things in their heads lik me.",
            "The game is awesome, the story line is really good, got me hooked on the moment I played it, not forgetting the three awesome guys i played with. I loved it! Thanks Genius Inc. Hope there's a season 2.",
            "I have probably installed at least 20 of your games and I love it. I do, however, dislike the amount if rubies required for premium choices and how long it takes to earn them through the mini game, but having that as an option was still nice. I loved all the stories I've read and the endings are amazing. The fact that after choosing one of the guys you can also decide whether or not you want to take the relationship to the next level and I didn't expect that, well done."

U can get more AP from 1 Ad for 60 AP which is only +3 taps. Also, the navigation sux, if u watch the ad vid, you get locked into a replenish screen and u have 2 close the game an reopen 2 continue",
            "I am getting frustrated concerning the scenes you earn by making the correct choices. 4 chapters in a row claims that I did not get the scene but try chapter again. I have done this for chapter 6 3 different times making different choices and I get the same result! This is the first game that I am not successful in regards to earning scenes, secret scenes etc...I refuse to spend anymore money repeating chapters where it seems no matter the choice the outcome is the same.",
            "It's amazing game but the ap system I don't like at all if it were fixed it's 5 stars no questions asked maybe give us less ap and do ap per episode not each tap",
            "I don't know why it says (access denied ) what is wrong with that game? That is really annoying.",
            "Everything's fine so far; Aaron's root is pretty sweet but your \"AP system\" is a problem over here as one line costs 20 AP and we get only 560 AP everyday (unless you buy them). For some reason, my game keeps on popping up with a notification saying \"your server isn't responding\" which is a problem since I'm having glitches in my story due to this problem. Regardless, the game is amazing (compared to Evan, at least)."

            "Well worth buying an entire game instead of paying numerous microtransactions, waiting to collect currency, or having to pick mediocre dialogue in order to advance the story without it. The story routes are wonderfully diverse, each worth reading and you get plenty of time for the money you spend. Somewhat new to the genre, I play through once before relying on walkthroughs, but I end up needing them for these games, otherwise my choices are just sloppy. Need more otome structured like this.",
            "I had originally put 3 stars on this but decided to give it another chance. It has a slow start but I am enjoying it more this time around so I decided to add a star for now, and hoping it will get even better. I still personally preferred \"Amnesia\" and \"The Letter\" to this one. But time will tell :)",
            "The game is amazing! I love the characters. The music and visuals are great! For anyone wondering why the other guys (shinapchi, sanan, etc...) routes aren't here, it's because this is based off the original hakuoki: demon of the fleeting blossom which only had 6 playable routes. I suggest buying kyoto winds and edo blossoms if you really want to play routes other than the orig. 6 and read a longer storyline. Overall, I think this game is great taking in to fact that this is a mobile otome!",
            "I downloaded this game thinking that I would be able to play all the available routes listed for it, however not all the dialogue options which are supposed to be showing up (according to every walkthrough I've read) are appearing. This is preventing me from getting on the routes (Harada, Shinpachi, etc.) that I wished to play the most. I like this app for the most part, but a \"premium\" version of the game doesn't do much good when it cuts out half the available options. Given the extremely high price for this app, I would request a refund, if the option were still available to me. I'm greatly disappointed.",
            "I love it! If you're like me and you hate those otome games where it's 10 easy payments of $9.99 for ONE ROUTE This game is PERFECT. A one time purchase with 5 or 6 fully voice acted routes? YES PLEASE! (However if you downloaded JUST for Tsuda Kenjiro like I did Kazamas route is..well not worth it to be honest and a bit disappointing given the amount of work you have to do to actually get it) Also not all routes available on this phone ver. But! All in all I would 100% reccomend the purchase!"

            "It was so fun!!!!! But, the Prince honestly scares me so much! And I love how they didn't rush the story! But, Some special moments I couldn't get because of the amount of rubies you needed to buy the special moments I only missed a few so honestly in my perspective this game is awesome!!!! I can't wait for more stories to come out because I am hooked to this story so Im so excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And in my opinion its so hard to choose just one guy there all so cute, Its so hard to pick! -S",
            "To anyone looking at this game the summary does not do it justice. I came in looking for simplicity and got actually good writing? (What???) Like the story was good, your character is likable, and the character all have a nice friendship that you get to see. It's so much more than what's it's branded as I would call this more of a visual novel (with choices) than just an otome game. Will say there is less Zeppelins than I would've liked so far.",
            "Very cute game. I love the fact you can casually earn gems so you can see other cut scenes with the characters you want. Story is pretty good! Art is lovely and easy on the eyes. Each character has their own quirks. It was hard to pick who I wanted to romance, since they're all so loveable.",
            "It's the best otome game I have ever played. And it's so easy to fall Iove with the 3 of them that makes it hard to choose though. Also could you lessen the time for when we could get 1-2 tickets.",
            "At first, I was confused trying to piece the puzzles together of who I was but then, the story was set in London so I took it step by step. I love the adventures and riding the air ship (imaginatively though). The prince was quite scary though. Yup, he was totally creepy but I understand him."

            "You guys are so so so so bad. I love the stories so much but i can't even play it.BECAUSE YOU GIVE US 1200 STARS AND ONE SENTENCE COST 10 STARS.I mean what the hell.I get to play 120 lines ONLY LINES everyday.FIX this.I KNOW you guys will not gonna fix this.But i am gonna tell tge truth. At least think about it",
            "Seems great. Story lines are nice, but I didn't know you have to have stars to read it. I don't want to spend so much just so I can read. This is sad and disappointing. 😢",
            "The art is nice. Story I really can't be sure. I haven't finished the first chapter and it's been more than 5 days. It needs 10 stars to read 1 line. So the free stars you get can hardly get you far in the story. Even if you watch a lot of ads, it's still not enough. I can't imagine having to pay a lot for something we're not certain of. Right now first chapter seems draggy and doesn't really get you hooked. Sorry. Also, it assumes I am a girl when I chose a guy character.",
            "The devs are great. They listen to the players which is great. Very prompt response time when something happens as well",
            "Game seems great, the writing is good and storyline is interesting, but I did not even manage to read one chapter as halfway through it asks you to use stars to continue, and stars are at 0 , you have to actually buy them. Very disappointing. It has great potential but too expensive. Had to uninstall."

            "As a f2p I'm totally fine being patient and this game really did take a long time. However, I absolutely adore Levi so it was worth it for me. It's a pretty simple long in every day to read 5 episodes otome, and while the episodes are really short, the plot itself was really good. Be warned though, you have to read the bad end before getting to read the good end, choices don't matter. In the end, you'll be able to read both ending it just really hurts to have to read through the bad end and wait another day before you can finally heal your heart with the good end.",
            "Personal i think the chapters are too short (but i like to read a lot!) I read 2 of the characters stories and will give it a third try but i honestly find this story game to be boring and Ricardo's dark ending is disturbing😐 i could have gone my whole life without reading that ending... I'll read one more story and if i find that boring too then im deleting this game😒",
            "I like the story and the characters, but every single time chose a character I always get the bad ending, which can get very irritating! that's why I wish there was a way to choose your ending, it would be good to go through all the different endings by re-playing the story. Also the stories are insanely Short and the gem feature is really annoying and stupid. Also why is the character you play as so shy and useless it's just way too cliche, just once can we have a strong female lead!?!😑",
            "I've finished all of the stories for each character. I'd advise reading all of the other boys stories before reading Lucas's. There are some wrong names (Lucia and Lucas's names got switched) and a couple places where the data says $PLAYERNAME instead of the name you choose, but other than that, it was a really good read. I almost cried!! If you have the patience to wait for recharges or set your phone aside while ads are playing, I definitely recommend this!",
            "If you have patience and you're okay with 5mins of story progression a day then wonderful! Otherwise you're going to pay more than you should to buy the story, it's way tooo expensive. I'm not supporting paying for jewels, it's a total scam and not worth what you get in the end. Be patient and play other apps like Love365 to fill time, at least I can buy an entire story there for $8 instead of $60+ to buy a bloody chapter and a half here. It's a shame because the story/characters are great."

            "I've been hooked up with these kind of games lately and so far, this was AMAZING! Everything was on point-music,graphics,storyline,characters! Thank you so much! Please do make a second part! There is serious creativity and passion put into this game. I'll be looking forward to your next games especially the sequel to this! If your looking for a whole package, this game is exactly what you need.",
            "I love everything about it. I have played it many many many many MANY times and it's really really good but it needs to be longer and have a part 2. OR there should be a series and it REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY upsets me that there isn't more and it's more upsetting when this game as been out for a bit.5 stars and A lot more on your other appas if you make this into a series! i bet it upsets other fans that there is no Part 2",
            "Loved reading the game, had a combination of different games. That's awesome. Love how it ends. Some decisions were hard and some made me regret making them but it was all worth it but my one complain is the story is to expected ... short. Over all loved to read it. Quick question; is there a nother one?",
            "It is a good game and I enjoyed it because most stories like this have passes but this one doesn't but the problem is when I dress or customize my character the screen turns black and I cant see a thing only I see arrows wich mean I jave finished so I see nothing and can do nothing if this problem is fixed I will rate it 5 stars"

            "Overall the game is just okay. There are much better games by Ciagram out there. Story and characters are fine but wording is confusing at times so you don't fully immersed in the story. The purchased special scene is short and just an additional scene, not something big or exciting. So far I've only read Mike and Johannes's route. For Johannes route, I hate every single character in there including MC except Johannes. I'll keep reading the other routes but I doubt my rating will increase",
            "This is a port of Accela's \"Forbidden Love\" with a modern interface. Don't be fooled by the extremely blurry intro video; the rest of the game is not like that. Ciagram just had to blow up the original intro, which was about 2x2 inches. This has a whopping 8 love intetests, but for some reason, only one character has side stories.",
            "I love the app! Story plot and everything is great. I want to read side story for others characters also. Please try to update that. Also the ads to watch for heart fragment is not working efficiently. Other than that it is a great app.",
            "Ok, so here's my edited review. As I play further into the game, it becomes more and more interesting. And the fact that the creators even let people watch ads for unlocking the story is amazing. Watching ads brings only a little profit to them comparing to paying for the story. I think they want us to patiently play the game and wait for it every day. I'm doing that right now and the feeling I get from that is so great. Being able to read the chapters I've been waiting for that is.",
            "I played this game since 5 years ago and i love mike's route and ended up playing his route again. I just wondering why the rating is so low xD. But im on mattews route now, i love the plot but the chapters number didnt show just go on the plot on and on so im confused what chapter where i am now but thats a little thing do deal with. Overall im satisfied owo"

But I never forgot about them(your games) my favorite guy so far that I have played is Matt all the way.

You have allot of potential I love and enjoy every minute of these games. Just wish had more energy.",

Make it more like the Chapters game or something like that.",

I may check back a few months down the line, I hope you guys do some serious bug fixes in the meantime...",

            "The story is great! I really like how you show both sides of the story. Currently I am reading a royal kiss and I like how persistent the princes are especially Prince Edward. The only problem I have Is that it takes so long to get a ticket I think you should put in adds to make the time shower. I would definitely recommend this game for anybody who needs to get away from realty.",
            "It's the best game ever!!! The stories really draw you in and actually make you feel nervous, happy, sad etc. The graphics are really nice, the stories are long and well written, but i have one thing that bothers me a lot. You can't watch more than 3 videos per day. It gives you like 100 honey stones as a gift, but you run out of them quite quickly. 20 honey stones are way too expensive. Please the game becomes boring without the scenes.",
            "This is the first game which make me fall in love with .And when I come to the end of any story I was literally upset that it finished so early. But we have to need 20 ticket for a choice and there are only 3 tickets we can earn from the videos in a day which is very less please give at least 10-15 ticket in a day from videos.",
            "I am so in love with this app!!! 100% recommend!!! The art is beautiful the stories are amazing, I get really into the stories. It makes me sad when the story gets sad, it makes me happy when it gets to a happy point. I finished one story and started a new one and the characters came across each other again I felt my heart sink because it wasn't his story... i felt a real connection with each story i read! Very well done!!!🥰💞",
            "This is my favorite otome dating sim thus far. After reading a couple stories, I can confidently say that it's definitely worth it. Sure you get 3 tickets to start with, but that's 1 ticket per chapter. Tickets regen 1 every 4 hours, & if you're like me you can read up to 5 chapters a day. When you first start they give you like 240 gems & when there's a premium choice it's always 20 gems. Only thing I wish is that it didn't cost tickets to reread books you've already read."

            "Good fun! The stories are interesting, I like all the characters. There's always a challenge to keep you coming back everyday which I do! My only complaint is that it is so hard to get points on the events. I have never got higher than the half million mark. Also its cool you can revisit past events but would be good if it saved your points progress so you can continue til you get all the prizes. It's annoying it resets to 0 if you wanna replay them. I don't bother it's impossible to rebuild up.",
            "I really enjoy this game. The story is great, the characters are great as well, sometimes there could be too many events going on at the same time so you have to choose what you are looking for. As for the otome elements, I haven't explored all the story contents but the art, voice acting and great characters will make you want to stay playing.",
            "I love this game! The story is engaging, the characters both memorable and unique. The main character is not your average boring otome game heroine who is basically a cardboard cutout. She has her own personality outside of interacting with the guys. The romance options are all unique in their own ways and their routes are all equally great. Honestly I would 100% recommend this game for fans of the otome genre!",
            "I like this game, and the different characters. However, they lose a star because the special events have direct spoilers into the main story. I can't get keys quick enough to avoid being spoiled but the eventd allow for more battles and items so I feel disinclined to avoid them. I've been spoiled so far into the story I met several characters chapters earlier. It makes it harder to attach to the story sometimes.",
            "This game is seriously so underrated! I love the story so much and unlike other typical otome game heroines, the mc here is willfully strong and not as stupid. I love the writing so much! I even liked the side characters too. The events are easy to play with too and it's very f2p friendly. Overall, I loveeeee it <3"

I chose christian the first time the stableboy ( i forfot his name) the 2nd time and oliver the 3rd hahaha. I like oliver the best . AWESOME GAME developers!!! :):):););) whoop whoop",
            "I'm rating perfect, y'all deserved it. The graphics and sound effects were amazing & the fact you can customize character is acceptable. The prob is you can't play it offline anymore unlike before. I've been a huge fan of your games, so i understand if you need ads so we can play it w/out paying. Thank you and hoping for more future games that will be free, i can stand ads and oh? I love the storyline too and i chose my beloved Knight Christian. It made me cry 😭 This game is worth to install!",
            "not lengthy enough for each character but its different boy same words, depending on who you pick, they need to be different, they need to show a reason why they've fallen for the princess in their own words and way, each suitor comes from a different background so they dont think the same, therefore their words shouldn't be the same! Also the princess has choices but not wide enough variety this story with each choice she picks should decide her future and who/how her life will be!"

            "Story is pretty nice, graphics too but ... Been playing this type of games for some time now and I am very familiar with the Mission parts where you have to gather some points to be able to move on. It is fair. But this game has mission after mission and the amount of points needed is ridiculous and hard to make. Mainly getting 10 points per try out of 15k let's say. Takes months to get. Even if adversar has lower grade you still can't beat and get only 10 pts and not 50. Too bad for the story.",

            "I absolutely love the story and wish I could play more, but the last challenge takes forever to complete. There is also this glitch that I don't have any items, like I receive it from my present box but when I actually want to use it, I don't have any items! This makes it even harder than it normally is to complete challenges.",

            "Excellent storyline and has a different format of gameplay as compared to others. Sustains interest and has a perfect combination of adventure, slight horror, and romance. It has rocked me to my core, and stands out from every other similar apps which I have tried. This is excellent work, and I am looking forward to more of such applications by Genius Inc Japan that consists of such a good mix of genres, as well as a similar format of gameplay which has multiple \"good\" and \"bad\" endings.",
            "I absolutly loved this game. It added actualy meaningfull choices, but it does have one problem. Forcing players to stop playing. To get all characters endings for this particular game means playing through the whole game. I would be okay with that but part of the problem is having no clue how to get the endings. Im not that patient tbh and would get bored quickly. So as a recomendation maybe get rid of the ticket system or make a guide for this game. Otherwise this game was a fun mystery.",
            "Amazing game good job with this one genius. I love how there are bad endings to your mistacks and how the girl you try to befriend throught the story becomes your girlfriend, not where you just choose between 3 at the end of the story. I would just like for the game to be a bit longer and for the ending scene to be longer. Other than that best game so far.",
            "This is hands down the best work of Genius Studio. Having choices that could lead to bad endings took me by surprise. This is something Genius Studio has never done. The story was absolutely amazing! I have never seen a story like this even as an anime. I spent hours trying to play detective and figure what the hell was going on. By the time I had something a ticket was ready. Characters were fantastic and so was the writing. I laughed countlessly. 11/10 is my rating. Incredible job you guys.",
            "!!!! The one game from Genius Studio Japan. where you're choices ACTUALLY DO MATTER. You better be careful about you choices because it will LITERALLY be GAME OVER if you choose wrong. This is by far the most enjoyable I've ever played. And it has replay value to see what other endings I've missed instead of just re-choosing the girl at the end. Also, you can't just choose the girl you want at the end on this one. You're choices make you end up with a specific girl. Have fun! VERY nicely done."

        "description": "■■Story■■\r\nYou’re a young woman whose childhood was always a blur for some reason. No matter how hard you try, you can never quite remember it. \r\n\r\nOne day after falling into a deep sleep, you wake up terrified in a dark, creepy world. But you’re not alone. You find yourself trapped in this nightmare world along with a few attractive strangers. Yet, they all seem vaguely familiar. Who are these guys? And why does your heart hurt so badly when you look at them, especially Licht? \r\n\r\nHowever, there’s no time to think about that when heart-wrenching apparitions of childhood begin suddenly appearing one after the other. But, before you can even process what is appearing in front of your eyes, a hideous monster shows up out of nowhere. It’s dead set to destroy you. Yet, strangely...even the monster seems to be suffering. What could this mean? \r\n\r\nYou run for your life scared and confused. Before you can unravel these mysteries, you wake up in a cold sweat. Only for the cycle to repeat itself every night when the bell tolls ten. What is going on? Why is this happening? \r\n\r\nYou agree to meet those strangely familiar young men in the real world to figure out a way to stop the cycle. It seems the nightmares are somehow connected to your shrouded past. Unfortunately, you also find out that if you die in the nightmare world...you die in the real world. \r\n\r\nWill you survive the night? Will you solve the mystery? Can you put an end to this life-threatening cycle of nightmares? Or will you be forever tormented by your past? Ready or not, embark on an emotional journey of self-discovery, friendship, love, and survival! \r\n\r\n■■Characters■■\r\n\r\n-Subaru\r\nThe first one you meet in the nightmare, calm and calculating Subaru seems distant and withdrawn. His distinctive red and blue heterochromia has you inexplicably enchanted, yet he seems to be ashamed of his red eye for some reason. Could he be hiding something?   \r\n\r\n-Ray\r\nThe self-asserted leader when you meet in the nightmare world, Ray comes off as cold and bossy. Always the voice of reason, the medical student has low tolerance for nonsense. But, perhaps there is a softer side to him? What could he be hiding under that gruff exterior?  \r\n\r\n-Licht\r\nThe most mysterious of the bunch, Licht calls you by name when you meet him in the nightmare world, but you’ve never met him before. Have you? You can never seem to find him in the real world. Why does just the sight of him make your heart ache and your eyes water? You both feel a strange connection and familiarity with each but can’t explain it. Could Licht be the key to solving the mystery of the nightmares?     \r\n\r\n-Thoma\r\nAlways the life of the party (even in life or death situations), Thoma is lighthearted and constantly cracking jokes. Everything feels a whole lot better with him around. But he sure does have a way of getting under Ray’s skin for some reason. Could someone that cheerful and optimistic be harboring dark secrets?",

            "This game is amazing! The absolutely adore the plot, the character designs and their lovely personalitys, the soundtrack and of course, the small cute scenes you can unlock using rubies, though they aren't exactly needed to be able to have your desired ending. This is by far my favorite otome game, it has such a deep and unique storyline, unlike some of the cliche interactive love stories we all know about. It wasn't all just about the romance and I absolutely adore that.",
            "This is the best game ever i have played from Genius inc. and this is my favourite game .I can't tell what i just experienced!!it's amazing!!! And I won't complain about the gems because if you can't choose premium choices the other choices doesn't insult you .This game is amazing definitely recommend to everyone. Hope more games like this from Genius inc.",
            "This is the very first otame game I played made by Genuis Inc. The storyline was great, the background music combines with the scenes (romantic or horrifying). I love all about this game! Truth to be told, a scene in this game almost made me cry for real! This game have touched my heart, I love it very much. It did made me sad reaching the ending, because the game was so good that I don't wanna end it. But I guess, stories really have endings. Everything ends in time. This game was worth it! <3",
            "The story line is amazing....though the story for thoma wasn't much. I loved the characters. The rubies...was a problem sometimes because they were some options which i would have love to choice. The ending was good and the concept/theory of the story was good too! The thing i didn't like was i couldn't skip the intro and it was irritating at times.",
            "I like the game the drawing is amazing and the story is even more amazing~ 💕 However...I don't like that my choices are useless in the story... I can't save the life of the characters no matter what i choose... I feel helpless 💔 i really hope that there's more choices that get a different ending, moreover... Why is it so hard to get gems and tickets? Even the ads that i watch only give me small amount of coins and EVERY 5 HOURS ! Make the ads give gems and let me watch as many ads as i want!"

            "I love visual novels but when I'm waiting for bus or people . So it's better if those are offline. But all the visual novels l read were online novels. So this was better than any other novels. And my the storyline!! The last chapter got me crying. I'm a bit too emotional. 😅😅 The people at the bus stop was looking at me and asked me if everything was all right. Was a little embarrassed but it was fun. 😊😊",
            "Wow! This is fantastic! I really like this even though I'm super not into horror (I get scared very easily), the aesthethic and art is pretty great, the story and the horror element is very nice together with the character dynamic that makes it so that its not just all horror, its nice. I love this VN, ngl if this gonna be anime it will be super great.",
            "EDITED: Wow. I'm actually speechless! the story is amazing! chapter seven's plot twist got me there! never knew I'd find some good stuff on the play store! but since i was not able to support the developers with money, i just watched the 30 ads so i can continue the extra chapter's story! i am really greatful that you created such an amazing VN app! i definitely recommend this to people who plays VN games. still 5/5!!",
            "Not usually into horror but i wanted to play a mystery story and i got just that. The last chapter blew my mind and through the whole game i was on edge..i have to say i kept tilting the screen away due do the effective horrific graphics😅 and had to omit the sound effects or i would not have slept that night🤭. Great game. Some chapters had less intricacies than others but they were still good as it added to the mysteries",
            "This VN definitely is something!!😍😍 I love all the characters, the stories, the lessons, even the graphics and sound fx.. everything in it is so amazing and well-made. I finished it in 1 day at 9pm and I'm so happy because I would definitely get very scared if I happened to read it during midnight😂 my favorite chapter is Chap 3 💖💖"

I loved this and I also loved the fact that you could watch the story about not have to wait like most story games and I also loved the personalities that the characters have because I feel like they resemble me and my friends alot most comments say that gigi is annoying but I think she is just so optimistic but I wouldn't get on her bad side if you know what I mean I'm sad that carter just up and left if you chose max which I think lots of people did he's just so lovable and I also loved that at the end of the story carter left a drawing of my character and it said 'thank you for a fantastic week' my heart just lit up with joy when I read that part and even though there was not many choices I really did love this story/app. Keep up the lovely work you do and I would love to see a love story between a boy and a girl like the players character could be bi and have to choose which person they love more, essentially a story about a person finding out there bi and how they get on with it😄I think lots of people would love it and I just thought because you were asking for suggestions so there's mine😊xxxxx",

Of course, all of the same smaller issues apply here as well, but this game in particular is a minefield of premium choices, sometimes even for menial things, it can really become overwhelming at times. Not my favourite but surely one of the best.",

            "It's ironic how the game is about these special paintings, yet the character designs themselves are like a work of art. I really liked them a lot! I only wish the game was longer than it was; I didn't get to try out all the Styles before beating the game. Other than that, I think that this is one of the better Kemco games. The story highly intrigued me, and the translation was near perfect and without repetitive words or phrases.",
            "Average story, not bad but could been more, the disappointing thing about it is you have alot of stragetic options and styles, but the lack of games  difficulty and longevity to build them, by endgame you would have utilised about 10% of skills gained. I would advise you keep a second save slot before the last boss, as there is no warning you will enter postgame and be locked out of 1 feature.",
            "Don't purchase points  in game shop.they will not put your purchase point in your game. I have done everything  that they said in their email sent. They just don't accept that there is a problem in their program.worst they will saynthat you have poor internet connection.thats a big lie I have10 Mbps internet.next they will say that it's your tablet. All of this, they don't have any plans to refund you. You purchase and Google always respond immediately email you of the receipt. DONT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY...........THERE IS SO FAR 2 GAME THAT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.....I DEMAND REFUND FOR THE 3 PURCHASES.IT HAVE BEEN 4 DAYS SINCE.........",
            "This game is fun, the story is good and there's plenty of skills to learn. Kemco please bring us Legna Tactics for your next release.",

            "I really like your games. However, getting gems are really off putting. I really want to make premium choices at times, but I'm forced to chose the other or \"rude\" option, which is a downfall for me. Other than that, you either have to spend hours getting enough points for gems, which really hurts me eyes from the minigame. Although, everything else is fine, gem exchange just needs work. Thank you.",
            "One of my favourite games so far! the story, the characters, and the heroine's personality especially that i relate to it, I loved all of them very much!! One thing is that it's hard to collect points and can take a long time but in my opinion it's totally worth it, the only issue is when i want to watch ad to triple the points it says ads are not available so it takes even more time to collect points, hope you fix this soon. other than the ad thing it's AMAZING thank you♡",
            "I really enjoyed playing this game a lot! I'd recommend it to the people who like this type of games and the rubies aren't hard at all to get even if you are a free player (mini games, etc) and the story itself was on point too same with the illustrations and character designs! I really hope that this game will have a season 2 soon and I can't wait! One of the best games I have ever played! Thank you genius inc for making such a beautiful game I loved it!",
            "This is another one of my favorite genius otome games. Romance is so great (really amazing and well written), characters are great, the art is great and I appreciate the extra effort adding the unique animated manga scenes. I'm good with the MC, she isn't annoying. Please season 2 soon! I'm really excited.",
            "Its great but there is 2 problem which is the diamonds each time you get points from the minigame and you have enough to buy diamonds how come you dont get the same amount of diamonds that you need to pay with your points like thats not fair we were hard to get those points.. Thats the problem with all your games. The secobd problem is the minigame. Why cabt it be a different minigame the minigame is so hard like when you get further into the story the minigame get harder."

            "It's the mind blowing game. We can choose anything without diamonds or keys... The story line is also fabulous. U must download this game and play it",
            "A few months ago, I installed this app. Enjoyed reading the story but I grew impatient when new chapters took several weeks to be released and uninstalled. Some months later, I reinstalled and read all chapters and it was quite enjoyable. Many reviews say they want a new chapter cuz they weren't satisfied with the story ending with the protagonist marrying one of the characters who had fallen for her but I think the MOST SATISFYING ending to this story is her not marrying either of them but moving on with her life. It's good that way. Overall, this was a good story. Well done to the developers. Oh, and I noticed that I can't save the time travel moments photos anymore and two (or three more photos I think) appear blank. Why?"

            "The story and artwork is great. Wish the extra characters also had artwork. The music and sound effects immerse you deeper. I feel like there should have been a \"CALL the COPS\" or \"Facepalm\" option. You DONT have to pay for the \"extra\" scenes to get a good ending. You do have to wait 2hrs for tickets to read the next episode. But honestly, I dont mind that so much. Can we get the next Season? Please! I want 'em to kick *********** butt so bad!",
            "This game is really awesome. Love it . The tickets come back at every 2 hours it's also nice we get the time to do things outside the phone. But the only problem is I want season 2 of this. Really really want it . The stories are too awesome . The person installing this is recommended to install twilight school also. That's also a really nice story",
            "First I want to say I did like this story I don't have a problem with that. My problem is with how abruptly it just ends. And I replayed the final chapter all 3 times thinking there would be bigger change and there wasn't. And I got so hooked on what's going on with all of them that the ending I wish could have had more to it. I'm left wondering so much and it's not very settling with me sadly. And I don't want to spoil it for others because they might like how it ends I just personally don't.",
            "I am in love with this story!!! Vice is so hot! My god!🔥🔥🔥The only thing is the chapters were shorter then any other game.. I really did not want this story to end! I totally recommend this one for sure. But my main question is when is the next season coming??? You cant just end on a cliff hanger like that!!!! 🤯 love it!!!!!! Keep up the amazing stories!",
            "I freaking love it but.. I'm only halfway through the story and I wanted to backread a small part I missed. I opened up the backlog and it gave me the entire story. It kinda spoiled the story for me. I'm still excited but now i know a fairly big spoiler about my character. If yall could fix that. That would be lovely. Also could yall make an all in 1 app for google play as well. Going on 3y with yall. could yall bring back the og Alice Story from 2 years ago. Ray's ending was HOT. Can't wait pt2"

            "I love the storyline, and the guys(particularly Shephe XD), but... two stars because of the gems, and how you're restricted on what to say. Sometimes, you can answer kinda rudely, but if you really really like that person, and don't have enough gems, there's just no feel for the story! Please please please make the gems no more! Or at least refill the gems everyday or something. All I want is to enjoy a good story, and you're giving me one: but you're also taking all the fun out of it!",
            "I really loved the story and the plot! It was just that it upset me knowing that i was out of tickets to get to the next story. Diamonds are easy to get, comparing to other similar games.I really apprecciate the time and effort that the creators/developers put into this game! I really recommend it if you are looking for a love story!",
            "(On my fathers account lol) This game is definitely a 5 star rating! I love how it isn't hard to earn gems, and I love the guys. (In particular, Dobe.) I definitely suggest this if you're looking for a cute romance game.",
            "I love the theme song! I was skeptical but Im glad I tried it. Never knew lowkey beastiality could be this sweet. Reminded me a lot of 'Heart of Fox'. The only issue I had with the game was that the story was hastily done in the end. Why were the delinquents vandalizing the shop? What happened to the rival shop? Also I was sure than Cain had something to with it since he was the only one who knew we were out, that route would've slapped. Hes involved. Theres tension. Build up. We bust him. Boom.",
            "The game is very well written and the gems are so easy to earn! To have the mini game which you can play blindfolded to allow us to gain the premium option is great! I just wish the stories were longer to enjoy more! Love this game and would recommend it to anyone that like me can not afford to pay for premium options and cuter stories!"

            "This story is so good . It really touches my heart . I love the charecter build of Ray. Ive cried to his sweet words and that very rare for me to do so very well written ! My only complaint is that I wish the points we get everyday was the full 40 to read the chapter not 37 it just makes it a bit annoying to have to download a game for the last 3 points",
            "Visuals are great. As for the story - please do not waste your time on Ray! Either they just dropped that story through Google translate or it was translated by someone who is not at all fluent in English. It's utterly TERRIBLE! Also the heroine in that one is just way too spineless for it to be a good read. I started with Natsume and it pretty great so it seems it depends on the story. Just don't read Ray on the English version, you will regret it.",
            "Last time, I complained that I didn't receive login bonus. I decided to give this game another chance. This time, the game just automatically restart. All my story progress and pictures were gone. I won't waste my time to play it again. This game is a mess with a bunch of errors and, well, the story line and characters were fine but not THAT fine to keep having to withstand those major errors. I remember someone complained the same thing as me, but it seems like the dev gave no attention",
            "Its a good game with worthy graphics and cute contents. Its free to play. Just watch 5 ads every day to get 5 pts to your daily login bonus. You can trigger ads by reviewing - skipping old chapters. As for the developers I'd add more branches to make it more sophisticated with several happy and bad endings in it to extend the gameplay. And the prologue could be better.",
            "I really love this app. The stories have both in laughter & tears with the MC & with the other characters. That's how much I really enjoyed this game. I don't like the factor some of the characters are teasing the MC so much just because she's a zombie, but I do love how the other characters are friends with her."

            "I generally like this game so far. I like the story telling and the characters. Yes there are ads and if you want gem you have to watch them, but personally that doesn't really bother me as much. I had games that were very needy, and now to have a game that I could play for a while and go back to other things, without missing anything is nice. One more thing is there is a little of Grammar issues or misspellings, but other that that, my experience with this game is nice and I do enjoy it.",
            "Its seems promising so far. I like the variety of options for relationships which I found hard to come by and some of the graphics are very nice too. However I find that each segment of a chapter is rediculously small. The regeneration time on tickets also seems a bit too long. Either that or decrease the length in between when you can't watch adds to get diamonds. With that in mind I'll continue to read this hopefully I won't get to impatient with waiting.",
            "This app sucks. Im not disrespecting or anything. I just dont feel it. Too much loading, adds, and even more adds! Im not even in chapter 2. In the boy×boy im reading. Its always so.... i dont want to be turned out bad in the public. My advise is just dont download it. It will just waste your time, money, and even wifi. If rating would have 0 i would press that.",
            "It has some bugs but it's playable. I think it would be nice if we get more gem fragments every 12 hours instead of only three so we can have more extra gems because honestly the story texts are short and 1 gem isn't enough. some choices are really...idk. like they both sound they'll do good results but I only get 10 impression because I chose the wrong one. And I'm disappointed with the event because I was really excited to see what was the after story and it was anticlimactic! :(",
            "Impressive with a few bugs. Ive noticed this while playing. The trust meter or count isnt really adding up with the original and the event one. I think its separated when you use gem to increase your trust. Also, When I first started the game, I gained 100 trust while the minigames but the main story count doesnt add it in. Also, Is the trust in main story and new started event isnt connected like at all?"

            "I love this game so much! The storyline was really good, also the ending was so great! Every background music combines with the scenes (romantic, horrifying, chill). I love all about this game! I can clearly remember every events coz I just finished this game today, though I made me sad reaching the ending! How I wish this story never ends, I really love it! The arts was also good! I like it! The game was all worth it, though it has a bit premium choices and a bit hard to get rubies by points.",
            "It's ok. Story is good and all but in order to choose most options you have to play a ton of mini games and I don't think the reward is even that great. It doesn't further relationship at all, it seams. You get a kiss or something and then that's it. I think if the relationship progressed because of it maybe it would be worth it. But the game just progresses without these options. It was also rather depressing seeing great options that I couldn't choose. So ya. Not for me. Art/music was pretty",
            "Everything is good about this game like graphics and characters are also very good and I really like the story too, they are perfect but the things that bother me is that it's to difficult to earn coins and daimons to earn coins you have to play a minigames and that's kinda irritating because it's difficult to earns coins in minigames too even if you win minigames you will only earns 13 coins or something like that and you can't even choose your answer because you won't have enough daimons",
            "I'm giving it 5 stars, because the art, the story, and the graphics are amazing! But unfortunately.. the heroine's personality kind of had to ruin it all. She doesn't have a grip on herself at all, she crushes on every guy she meets and she lets her girly feelings take the best of her.She's kind of cringy I'd say I wouldn't like to be like that to be honest^^\" Please don't get discoraged by that. Everything else is spectacular. Maybe just in next projects the heroine would be more put together?",
            "I loved this one so much. The story is great and I enjoyed the romancing in this game. The MC is good too, I have no complaints about her. Not having a second season is good in my opinion because my craving for more is what made me realize I liked this a lot. Most likely will rerun this in the future."

            "I love the game very much! Great characters with developing talents and stories and a great MC too!! The plot really makes you feel that you're a part of the story, but I really just have one complaint about the 5 free ads every day... It always says \"Failed to receive/send data\" and it really stops me from getting more gems. I hope this problem gets fixed soon.",
            "I love this game! The story is interesting and really pulls you in. Each character is unique which is pretty hard when you have 24 main characters. Hell, even the player character has tons of personality! Something rare in these games. The one downside in my opinion is that it really isn't a game, per say. You spend most of your time doing practices, which is literally just tapping, there is other things you can do like a cash minigame, but you aren't really playing. Other than that great game!",
            "I love this game so much! I've only been playing since September 20 and I'm already in love! Some of the characters can be so relatable! And the wide range of plays and music is amazing! Every story i different! And it's real easy to work your way up without buying gems! Would definitely recommend!",
            "I love it! it's not really a game, it's more story based, like it's not rhythm. also it's like impossible to get gems if there's no event going on so there's a limited amount of gems you can get which is hard on f2p players. I think you guys need a server upgrade too , i constantly have the problem of not being able to download anything and I miss hours of practice and events bc of it :( I really love the characters and the art though! I love the events and frequent content",
            "This game is everything and more that I'd want in an otome game. I do admit that in the beginning it was a little hard to understand on how to play but as you keep going it makes sense. The storyline is fasinating and intruging, the characters have backgrounds and stories to be told, the suspense of it all makes me happy when everything turns out ok."

I understand that app developers want money, but not everyone can afford to put money out on a game. That being said, I do enjoy playing the app and reading the stories.",
            "Honestly this game is really fun and addicting. The biggest downside would be just how expensive everything is. It's weird that you have to use gems for outfits the he apparently bought for you. You have to use diomands to flirt, have sex, go on a date; pretty much anything to make the storyline interesting will cost you diamonds, a lot of diomands!",
            "The game is fascinating I like it so much. But there is one problem that's making me to hate it.The app keeps on clashing when I open it. I've updated the app today & I've not played since morning bcoz of the problem I've spoken of . So plz help me fix it up so that I can at least play it tomorrow or the day after plz! Plz! Fix it up I don't want to end up deleting the app",
            "I would like to complain that I cant get to read Painted Soldiers (a romantic story). I have used the key to unlock but it take time to download the content. Since I'm using my house WiFi and it's speed but from today it has problems. If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",
            "I understand the world is just slowly starting to develop an open mind. But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

We’re very excited about the improvements we made to the game, hope you’ll be, too!<br>Needless to say, some bugs were squashed so you could have a better gaming experience.<br>As every week, we have new chapters coming out so time to start reading your favorite stories!<br>Install and enjoy yourself!",

            "The game is fun and addicting, I just wish the choices didn't cost so much, I realize money has to be made, but it would be nice if there was an option to get more than 10 a day for a VIP pass. UPDATE: I still enjoy the game, however it would be nice if once you played through a story, you didn't have to use tickets to go through it again or use more gems to get hairstyles or clothes or pick choices you already made.",
            "I liked the stories but it gets expensive very quickly (I could buy several books with the costs) and you can't change the gender of your character. It was set to female and that was my only choice. The ad I clicked on showed a gay storyline but none of the story choices were that type. I'm a little confused. I also purchased the vip package but saw no benefit from it. Not really sure what I paid for. Still spent a ton on gems, had to buy outfits, hairstyles, experiences, and keys.",
            "Now don't get me wrong the storylines are awesome,they're steamyinteractive but the price of the gems are ridiculous! Now I've downloaded this game I've given it at least a week before I made a judgment on it to actually post a review but it's ridiculous the amount of money that needs to be spent in order to have a good choice or a good ending........ So it keeps the reader interested, it is too much money I understand that you guys need money to keep the game running but it shouldn't be THIS",
            "I love the storyline but like others have said, it's hard to get diamonds. It gives you options but you can't afford the premium options. I think you should be awarded more than 1 diamond for reading a 10-15 minute story. I would love to finish but I'm afraid I may have to uninstall this because at the rate I'm going, I will not get finished. Plus when you click to try to speed up or add diamonds, the game locks up and you lose where you were and you don't get rewarded.",
            "So far I love this app but gems are very useful and I have barely enough for anything. And the fact that you have to buy clothes that you already have. So gems need a big upgrade like come on it really needs it. I love the story that I am in and I think that's it the best but it judges you if your clothes aren't good enough 😕 and some of the best things cost so much gems its unbelievable. So I am on Lessons on Lust or something and I wanted to do the threesome with Gemma but its costs to much."

            "DON'T PLAY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! It would be a nice game but unless your willing to spend money your not going to get anywhere. Its ridiculously difficult to get any 💎's to move along in the game. I couldn't even get past creating my character because I didn't have enough 💎's. And watching a bunch of ads to try and get gems no thanks.",
            "The app is good for casual play, I usually have a couple of books going at the one time to build up diamonds. The only criticism is things cost too much diamonds and sometimes the videos for free keys and diamonds don't work.",
            "For how expensive this game is, you would think that they would update their stories. It has been two months since some of the stories received a new chapter. Choices are normally 20+ gems EACH and you're not even given that many through the free options they keep mentioning. It will take days to reach that amount using the free gem options. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor and saving yourself a load of disappointment, frustration and regret.",
            "Fun game, but it's completely ridiculous just how expensive it is. You need a TON of diamonds to play, and there is no way of collecting nearly enough for free. You need to buy and even with that, they go so quickly it's not worth it. It's not a choice game when there are 2 options and the one you want costs you at least 20 diamonds, almost every single time. Clothing changes also cost 20 to 25 diamonds. I would be willing to pay a reasonable monthly unlimited amount to play, but this is insane.",
            "Awesome game....just not enough free options. The game is initiated with you're having to purchase."

But if go in it again it works. Number 2, im kinda sad that the part-time-workers from beggar life are not there :( But otherwise everythings amazing!",
            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",

Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",

I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

            "I played one game called 'Sentence' just like this before. I would give them 5 star⭐ but not this one. Because the content is very less as compared to it and you mostly spend your time solving puzzles which are to be fair are kind of hard. I still have to complete the game, but story is not much of moving for now at least. It's just like random chat. I think you guys should improve on content. Very limited dialogues in between puzzle like only 3 or 4. I would prefer to play 'Sentence' over this.",
            "This game is super fun , but i really have a hard time on those puzzles when i started the game . I dont know if it's just me who struggles or anyone else . 😭😭😭 But either way it super good i suggest this game if u want to play a detective like game But the main thing is the puzzles there super to hard to be able to get stars to move on to the next step. 😕",
            "It's pretty bad. The minigame everyone complains about isn't actually that hard, but this is a mystery suspense game, and you have to spend more time in the block minigame than you do solving the mystery. Easily the worst definition of puzzle since Milon's Secret Castle. Your dad messages you, \"you're a failure, son. I hoped to see you at your sisters grave today.\" And you can just \"sure thing Dad, hey I gotta go play Tetris now. Smell ya later\" what a horrible concept for a mystery game!",
            "This one's an odd mix. It's easy to navigate and play. The interface, characters and mysteries are compelling. But then the player is plunged into bizarre, glorified tetris disguised as \"hacking.\" It completely shatters the immersion. That machanic may appeal to some, but I found it too confusing. Like playing a comedic mini game in the midst of a serious drama. I got as far as the pic of the sister. I'm not compelled to go further.",
            "The developer should be listening to the 2 common complaints running through both the positive and negative reviews. The 'fit the block' puzzles just are not for everyone. I didnt have a hard time with them, but when you have people telling you that the puzzles are too hard to continue or they would rather watch a commercial than solve your puzzles,you need to listen and offer an alternative option. I myself thought that it was a lot of cube puzzle solving which I did but got bored with."

            "I absolutely love this app! It has been keeping me occupied for months now! The stories are so much fun and the amount of choices and customization are so well done! However, with the addition of the Lucky Spin, I find myself with an abundance of tickets but rarely any diamonds. I would suggest making some kind of transfer feature where you can trade in tickets for diamonds or vice versa. I have 100+ tickets that I don't use very often and it would helpful to exchange them for diamonds.",
            "I'm very disappointed. You could never reach a good ending unless you pay for all the \"right\" choices you could make. I played 2 of the stories, I liked the artwork and storyline but when it comes to picking up a choice the game was awful. At first I paid for some of the choices but not all of them and still didn't reach the good ending because of the high level of the total score in game. I'm deleting it and I don't want to play it anymore.",
            "I really like this app, I don't feel cringe with the stories and I love the animation and the way we see the character portraying the role. But I have some concerns, I hope you could lessen the amount of diamonds needed for each scene. I hope the creator of this app would give chances to people who can't afford buying tickets and diamonds all the time. Please consider🥺 I am really sad with the ending of the story just because I don't have enough hearts to be with the person I wanted to be with.",
            "I've played a lot of different interactive story apps and this one by far is the best one I've come across. First of all the stories and characters are really well written and art is very captivating. But what I like most that this app provides is if you spend money to buy diamonds to enjoy those fun little additional perks they offer, you keep that purchase. Meaning you can reread individual chapters or the whole story as much as you want and you won't have to remake that previous purchase.",
            "This is the only simulation game that stayed on my phone 😊 The art is very beautiful and diverse depending on the story you are playing and does not look repetitive.. The plot itself of the stories are well-thought-out considering that majority are based on naver series. Finally, I love how there are different ways to get diamonds without spending money by watching ads, daily log-ins, and weekend raffles and its not a minimal amount.. 😍"

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Simply impressed !! You guys out did yourselves, fantasic storyline with a dark undertone. Beautiful and haunting music, coupled with detailed and beautiful artwork. Loved the backstory and graphics, including the CGI animation. Good work on how the evidence board was compiled to move the story along with the prisoner, nothing was boring. Nice puzzles and hidden object scenes. Had fun, keep'em coming.",

Am deleting it as we speak and will NOT be downloading any of their games in the future! One very dissatisfied customer."

            "Seems cool but also seems to play an ad after every puzzle solved? Or often? Which isn't in itself a problem since I understand free games have ads, but the issue is the way the ads are displayed - there's no X or \"close\" button for me to close them. I've tried shutting down the game and starting it back up and it often puts me back before I solved the puzzle and when I solve it again I'm back with an ad I can't X out of",
            "I am so hooked on the Spotlight series of escape games! The price is fantastic, plenty of gameplay, and the puzzles are good. I would compare it to Glitch Games but without the long storyline or all the manuvering from one end of buildings to the other. Tons of puzzles and some are very challenging. The puzzles are real puzzles - not \"put random item A into weird location B then combine with hidden compartment C\" - but actual logic based puzzles.",

Also I would like to add a friends list so you could vistit your friends village. Besides that it is a really exfun game! Also can you buy things with your coins? That would be very helpful! I dont have any gems. One more thing. It gets pretty upseting when you run out of blocks. Its best if you don't level up. You really should get this game!",
            "Well Personly this game is AMAZING and you can build WHATEVER YOU WANT! So i recomend to play this game and Going to the build button on the right and clicking it, it gives you many different options when you level up you'll see more buildings and so you can build yourself your own personal house and stuff so i hope you have fun playing this game!",
            "Block Craft 3D is a nice game. You could get ideas from other's villages. You could buy pets, doors 🚪, and some others. But please 1 tiny thing. Can you fix the credit card issue. Cause I'm 10 and I don't have a credit card number. Way far from that, I love the game and Thank you!",
            "The game keeps closing for no reason and it's annoying when it gets stuck and when you are walking it makes you go through the building or through the wall. The cool part is that you don't have to build stairs. if you build a tall building and a single file building on that wall if you take out two blocks and stand under it and place on block under your avertar you will go right to the top of your building almost like an elevator",
            "Bad game You can't fly without paying, There is no survival mode, you can RUN OUT of blocks in creative mode, you have to wait 2 and a half hours to get them back. Speaking of blocks, you only get like 40 blocks for free. You can unlock a maximum of 20 blocks at a time for an unreasonable price. Bad game. Did I mention that you can't sneak?"

            "Wow, so far so good! I've never been really the type to play otome games even though i love anime and manga's so much since well, im the impatient type of person, cause it really annoys me how when i make the wrong choice i'll have to start over again and all the money type that ive been earning just went to waste ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ im yo typical cheap person you see. not only that but this game is so easy to play! I really find it enjoyable and the story is also good! Thank you for making this!",
            "Loved this one too. The three Harus are all adorable for me tho I had a hunch that one of them was a possessive one and I didn't like him that much xD but I finished all the routes. I wasn't patient enough to see their bonuses because their chibis appear very rarely and I don't have money to purchase the cookies to make them appear. But overall it's good! My fave is Haruto ^^",
            "Great f2p clicker based game that is definitely a cute way to pass time. The art and plot was really adorable too. Each of the guys were super cute and I personally really liked takaharu. They had the 3 very cliche personalities but I didn't mind I though it was still cute. Beware there is a yandere in such a cute story and the story line does have a dark end, bad end, normal end, and happy end. It gets a little repetitive but its a pretty quick game so I didn't mind",
            "Good graphics, has a nice story. Very easy to play. Just be patient to finish the story if ever you don't want to purchase. If there's a season 2 or the continuing story I would immediately download it. Hoping to have that season 2 co'z the happy ending seems a cliff hanger.",
            "This game is just perfect. The story was heart-warming and almost unpredictable, so when you get the happy ending it's so much more fulfilling. Also, the game doesn't make you buy anything (although some upgrades can be bought) the story still progress fine without it and is not dependent on them. It kind of takes time to get the fragments but its not boring since you have to tap them. Overall, I loved this game so much and would totally recommend it."

            "Love the game, please though let us play half the game instead of a intro and 1 chapter. Like the game so much though keep improving.",
            "Its a good app but after chapter 1 you have to pay to continue! At least make the game money instead of you think you dont have to pay! Very disappointing and please remove that you have to pay.",
            "You need to pay after the beginning to continue, so I gave it a try. I have to say it was worth paying since the game has an interesting plot and the story is long enough to keep you playing for a good while. I enjoyed it a lot, so I recommend it if you're a big fan of Visual Novel games.",

            "Just my type of game. Doesn't heavily rely on p2w status that heavily(yet?). Devs are pretty generous. Edit: sad to say, I have to lower the score to 3 star now. Right now, CP wars is horrible. No cash, no cp. But i understand that it's how the game get its profits. Arena, is not worth it anymore. It has become an endless grind. Not really that bad, but there's something missing. Contents, we need contents to keep players, be it P2W or F2P.",
            "I have th PC version and the mobile version, its just as good on mobile, it runs so nice and smoothly on the phone. When it first came out I had game bugs that gave me a big disadvantage, but now I have restarted the game on a new phone and the game has improved alot since then. Sadly I lost my characters but I was able to catch up really quickly and better than before.",
            "I don't like this game but i'm addicted to it. May be i got brain washed. The reality in this game is you can become stronger by spending money. You can enjoy the game w/o spending too much but once you play this game, mark my word, u'll definitely find a way to spend some to get stronger if you want to. I just put 3 stars because once u get disconnected, you will need to restart the game before you can play again and its really annoying when it happen while u're about to finish the merchantry.",
            "Generally really fun. This latest update though has me stuck in a loop where it says it needs updated. But i have it updated to the latest version in the store. So it keeps sending me back to the store then back to the game then back to the store when there is no additional update? Update 10/29/20 they once again updated the game and made it unavailable to android users. Its a waste of money on this game when they continously update it and make it unavailable for days on end. Down to 1 star",
            "At first release it was good . But now it's heavily pay to win. It becomes a slot machine game. So to new players I'll warn you it's to late for you guys to catch up on the game.you need to spend your entire life savings just to catch up with players if your only a casual player well it's to late there no content for you here the game contents is only for people who spent so much on this game to enjoy it. I'm telling you f2p way here it just a bluff. Save your precious time on something else"

            "No missions. Each heart is worth a very short paragraph. Watch 3 videos per day to get 1 whole heart. $0.67 per ticket if you buy 90 OR 135 tickets. $0.77 to over $1.00 per ticket as the bulk sales decrease ($1-$90 per purchase of hearts). No good otome apps out there but I still can't bring myself to spend these prices to read or wait a long time to read for free. --- Edit: O tried this.....the fact that I can go back and re-read chapters in the current story I'm reading has earned hearts.",
            "I'm really loving this game but a small problem, and a question. About the album photos, they are not displaying completely, appearing like a broken piece. Is it only for me or everyone else??? I really wanted to see those photos completely. Please do something 😢",
            "I like it at first but what's happening? 😂 I'm getting pretty annoyed at \"me\" there. And the plot is so simple. I'm having a hard time to continue it. I'm in Kairi's route and I don't like how the storyline progress.",
            "Not bad. I like the story. It certainly hooks you the 1st 10 chapters. I want to see how this one ends"

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

            "It's a really good game in my opinion. I love all the song choices and the story. The art is really cute too. I never knew that a music game would make me so happy and emotional. I really love some songs like \"Waltz in devils playground\" and \"I hate to tell you\" although, love all of the songs. I would tell other people to play this. I'm so happy this game was made. Thanks for all the hard working people who helped make this game. Also, thank you Rayark for making this lovely game.",
            "This game is incredible. By far my favourite game of its kind due to the high quality unique music, the stunning visuals and art, and the always compelling storyline. I've been playing Deemo since I first started college four years ago and have been playing it since. I listen to the music regularly, have been inspired to learn some of the songs on piano because of this game, and is in general a relaxing and fun game to play when I'm bored. By far one of the best apps I have on my phone. Period.",
            "Simple story, but the way it is told is superb. Just by the way the story is told, it's easily one of the best, if not the best rhythm game of all time. Not to mention how the soundtrack and bgm are well thought out, and fits the player's mood perfectly. The ending moved me so much I cried. Still get a heartache along with teary eyes every time I hear that one song. It's so good that it ruined my experience of other rhythm games as I can't help but find them lacking in comparison.",
            "My first DEDICATED rhythm game, and it slowly is teaching me, a beginner, to properly play and doesn't punish me for missing notes! Each and every one of the music is unique and has meaning. The story is told in a beautiful but short cutscenes, allowing us to piece the puzzle of the story together. I love it and I hope others will too!",
            "So, after few months after my last review which unfortunately was a 1 star, I can give this 5 stars again, my purchases came back and I can play again. If you like rhythm games this is the best mobile one out there. Great sound tracks, amazing challenge but with an easy start for beginners. Honestly you can't go wrong with this game."

            "I've played this for about a year. It's very addictive. Only reason I will not give 5 stars is because of the adverts. Although this game does not thrust adverts at you after every level like some games do, you can optionally watch an advert to get a boost. Only problem is with some adverts they start forcing you to install another app/game, or sometimes the adverts freeze, or sometimes they cause the game to restart, they have even caused the phone to reboot. This is not good.",
            "Been playing this game for a couple of years now. I like how the daily rewards don't reset if you miss a day. I love that there is always something to do. Standard mines, event mines and the mainland. It would be nice if the prestige for the standard mines wasn't so expensive. I've only managed to prestige 2 mines in 2 years although I do spend most of my time on the event mines to be fair. Nice game to spend some time on. I like how you can upgrade your miners too.",
            "The game is fun enough, but I gave it 1 star for two main reasons. The game has recently started asking me to rate it at _least_ once a day. This is incredibly annoying, but here's your review. The other reason is that I was just offered the \"no-ads\" offer for $15, and coincidentally the game now freezes nearly every time I click on an ad for a boost. I keep having to exit the game, try to watch an ad again and hope maybe it works. I feel like maybe the two things are related. ETA: I did email.",
            "great little clicker, perfect for when you have a few minutes to spare, fast user interface and heaps of things to do, lots of freebies and a steady (if not a little slow) way to make premium credits however some of the in game purchases are fairly expensive, but honestly they're not necessary to progress in the game.",
            "The game is designed to kill time, it does that. Puzzles are my favorite, but when I'm on hold and still have to pay attention to my world this kills the time. Don't expect to be grabbed by how in depth or awesome this game isn't. Just click to fidget. Do I love it, no. Does it work as planned, yup."

            "Story doesn't seem to bad, but you can't read more than 20 lines of text a day, that's only around 1min a day, and while you could get a bit more by watching adds and playing roulette, the max award you can get is additional 10 lines, which takes less time than to watch an add, and you might not get any points to read a story at all. And prices are just ridiculous, like 5$ for what would be 5 min of reading top, so this is a complete scam dumb people out of their money system.",
            "Some text bubbles won't pop up, and then it'll show \"english gap frase 0006 Primer Capitulo Parte Cinco Frase 0015\" but the numbers will change with each line. EDIT** Switching my review to 1★ because when I uninstalled the game and tried to reinstall to fix the text bubbles, it tells me that I cannot reinstall the game, but it pops up on my home screen. When I click it, nothing loads after 10 minutes. Please fix this bug because I really love this game, and I don't want to drop it.",
            "This game is a joke. You can't even play the game for 30 seconds before you run out of energy. I kid you not that you will only get 2 or 3 lines of dialouge before energy runs out. I guess the only good thing about it is the costumization and art style. I would rather pay for a full game or atleast a ticket system. You developers should be shamed of yourselves. I am so sick of the gaming industry being ruined and scamming people out of money. I get you guys need revenue but this isn't the way.",
            "Cute character design and CG, nice addition of animation anf character customization, but hell it seems like selling a literal heart for the Heart to progress on the story (it will be also feel worthy or not depending on how long the narrative would be). AND it's still Season 1 in which those 2000 Hearts can't even get through two whole chapters.",
            "The storyline and graphics are nice, but the \"heart\" energy system is brutal at 10 per section of dialogue. I considered redoing chapter 2 when I realized I missed something (didn't click the flirt option when available) but the heart cost is outrageous so I decided to try a different character instead. Not optimal. It would be nice to have a \"back\" option for cases like that so you don't have to redo the entire chapter. But even better would be to make the energy system less expensive and refresh more quickly than 200 per day. More chapters would be nice as well, as I seem to have reached the end of the current content. (I suppose I should load up on hearts with roulette and the free daily hearts.)"

Is not worth it $11/months for premium. I don't know where i need to tell this. If I'm not wrong crunchyroll promise in 2014, they want to make all anime available in my country. In reality, until now maybe less than 10% anime available in my country compare to U.S crunchyroll",
            "Amazing app, there's loads of anime to choose from. But there's WAY too many adverts. I feel like I only get to watch half of the episode, because the rest is advertising different series.",
            "I love the app and the selection, but I think the app would benefit from a request board of some sort where people can go once a week or something like that to request a new anime they want to watch, instead of contacting you through social media or the help center. Other than this feature I do love the selection and the app and I hope you all are doing well.",
            "The app was never that functional to begin with, but recently became completely unusable. I have high speed internet, but I can't watch a single episode without buffering every 15 sec and being automatically switched to low quality. Rest of my streaming apps are fine. Casting to Chromecast was bad to begin with: it would disconnect regularly or refuse to sync, but now the video quality makes it impossible to watch on a larger screen. A video streaming service that can't stream video. Incredible.",
            "This app is really good never really had a problem with it till now, everytime I tried to watch something it always says that it can't connect to crunchyroll. My internet is high speed it has nothing to do with it, i've tried resetting everything from my phone to reinstalling the app but it always says that. I really hope I can get some help to fix this problem."

However considering all the functions of the game I dont get why it needs an active internet connection to play. Even if it does it should've been mentioned on google play just like many other games.",
            "It is an enjoyable game nice graphics and physics.my only thing would be to make the dpad floating and so can uused by either hand as I have no use of my left it would make it. Easier if all controls could be used by the right.",
            "Love the game so far,it better then alot of the game out there, but having so difficulties with the store right now it not letting me use my gold or gems. Hopefully it will be big free soon.",
            "Needs more character customization other than costumes. Graphics look like a PS2 game. Aspect ratio is messed up on my device with no option to adjust. Creature design is pretty good",

Other then that I really like this game have it for the ps3 ,and now for this it keeps me besy . Hope this helps",
            "Oh this is the really really good game if you get to know it. That's a pretty good game I gave it four stars I would give it five stars well because I'm on Android and I can't get achievements and I can't see my friends when they're online :(. I wish I could earn achievements so I can get points too will be a lot easier for me. I hope soon Android can earn achievements if you do let it please and let us see our friends online too. If you can fix that.",
            "Really an amazing game. I've never found a game that's better than minecraft! I love the fact you can play with your friends, enable TONS of resource packs and let your imagination run wild! I think this game should be free so younger children can experience it themselves, and help their creativity improve! One glitch I need to report, though. Whenever two of my friends are on my friend's realm, I can never join, and never can my friends. I hope you can help with this, thanks.",
            "I love this app. I have played it for many years but recently it hasn't been working. Everytime I try to sign in my xbox account it takes me out the app and tells me the app stopped working. I reset my device 10 times. I even asked my friends who play it if it was working for them. It wasn't. This started happening after the recent updates.",
            "I'm very happy with this game it was worth my money, but every time I open minecraft it doesn't work and I have to close the application. This is although the first time it happened and hopefully the last. The problem isn't fixed yet so if someone could help me please do. UPDATE Even with the new update it still doesn't work I hope you guys will fix it. It freezes every time I open Minecraft . EDIT: it works again. If you have the same problem watch a YouTube tutorial. Worked for me."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I like what the app offers, but I cannot get it to stop freezing up. I've used it on my smart TV, laptop, and phone. It will freeze and the whole app has to be rebooted. Usually at least 2 or 3 times per episode. Very frustrating.",
            "Don't get me wrong for rating the app with one star, I do love this app but, the problems are the ads, and when I tried to subscribe, it said I can't do it at the moment, so when I checked the app store for the apps that are (subscribed) the only one that showed up was viki. And guess what? I still have got few weeks until the subscribtion expires but still all the shows and movies are locked, so please tell me what is going on and what is the problem here",
            "Im unable to fastforward drama or backward it,each time i leave the app to do something when I'm back i have to start the same episode from the begining pls fix this,i appreciate your efforts on this app but still needs to do better,it is really annoying.",
            "I really like this app! My main concern is the advertisements. Okay, I'm actually not too bothered by how frequent they are, I'm a patient person and I understand that's how the app is able to run, but sometimes the ad has trouble loading and freezes. A 30 second ad will have me wait two minutes bc it takes so long to load. And I know I can get vikiplus to avoid ads but I'm poor. Besides that, the quality of the dramas are clear and the captions are well made!",
            "It's really wonderful application .it's help to find lots of drama here. Am satisfied with this.but the problem is with resolution because we can't adjust what we want, sometimes network can't help to watch in that time we only can help with adjust the resolution but here there is no adjustments in this application!. can you fix with that others wise it's a good app👍"

The cloud save included is helpful, and the touchscreen interface, and movements are smooth and perfect on the phone. Feels as good as a modern RPG. Best of all, unlike other FF games it doesn't require alot of data to download upon purchasing.",
            "Being that FF 5 was my very first Final Fantasy Game I ever played, this port is spot on. I originally played FFV GBA and got to world 2 as a kid but could never beat exdeath, until years later when i replayed it when i was older. Its great essentially having the FF 5 GBA version ported to the mobile devices, so i can easily play on the go. Even with the simplified sprites and artstyle, i really dolove the character portraits a lot more then the GBA version.",
            "Overall just extremely disappointed.... Things were fine UNTIL about a week ago it crashed and I thought huh... And when started again it wanted me in install the data, okay so I tried and no matter what I do with it's \"guides on how to bypass\" the bug/fail I still can't. This is utterly disappointing and to all looking to buy this I say don't until this is fixed...",
            "5, 6, 7, and 8 are my all time favorites. Just bought 7. Buying 5 & 6 in hopes it prompts you to release 8 for mobile! Thank you! No regrets rebuying all titles. Worth every penny!",
            "Game is great but the font for almost everything on the game is fuzzy, bright, and almost unreadable. Would've rated five stars if this wasn't such a big issue"

            "Very very very very slow. I only need to complete two birds and six dinosaurs. Figured out how long it would take. Gave up. I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over £200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

            "The story is unique, and the characters are amazing! The makers truely care what their fans think and incorporate our ideas into the game. I am truely fortunate to have played this game and i hope there is a second one. It also has english or spanish, the english can be a bit off, but for the amazingness of this game i am more than willing to work with it",
            "I love this! Also there isn't an ad that pops up every 5 minutes, but you do have to watch an ad to get coins. Though that hasn't been a problem for me. And I can't wait for the next update!!!",
            "Really great otome game, one I've been waiting for. I absolutely adore the characters and their depth. Feels like I'm playing a shoujo manga",
            "A nice game with wonderful art. So far the storyline is good and the characters are likeable. My main gripe is with our MC. Her personality is well, not the best. I see the other reviews also agree with me and that she can be a bit rude and childish at times. It majorly affects the game since she is a big part of it and personally makes me feel disengaged at times with the game. There are a few grammatical errors but they are very minor ones. Overall, it's not a bad game but could be improved."

            "I like this game alot! Its very fun to make vlogs and other stuff. I got this app a couple days ago and I already am starting to love it! There is an issue with the ads but that doesn't really bother me alot I don't find it a problem.. you can create vlogs, dress your avatar up, make vlogs, and more! Other than the ads this game is amazing. The way that you can comment on peoples vlogs/videos is AMAZING! Its really fun how you get 10,000 subs in one day. I hope the future updates are good too!",
            "I love this game! Its amazing and has so many things that are cool! One thing that would be better is maybe if u could comment on other peoples videos just like in real life!! Other thann that there is a really good game that every one should install as soon as possible! Make sure that u dont have ads though because there are a lot of them! Makers if your reading this please cut back on all the ads they are kinda annoying and ridiculous how many there are! But overall its a really AMAZING game!!",
            "I love this game! I would give it 5 stars but there is a lot of tapping and the more videos you make the longer it lakes to make them. I wish you could comment on other people's videos and comments. You should make it so you can interact with different objects like the swimming pool and basketball hoop and maybe even control what you are doing in the videos. Like you say your going to do sports as the topic and then you try and shoot hoops for the video. I do recommend this game, it's fun!",
            "Amazing game! I love playing it. I would recommend it, has fun rewards, you can watch a stream, etc. But one thing that bugs me is when I got more then 5,000 subscribers, the box thing didn't unlock. Please fix it and I will get a 5 star rating for you.",
            "It's a pretty fun game I've been looking for something like this for a while. The reason for three stars is bc to post a video all you do is just pick a topic and done. Like you can only TALK about something not like do a challenge. I wanted to do a WoF video but you can't do that."

            "I love every single Genius Inc. game, the stories are very different, interesting, and engaging. But I feel as if the token to gem thing was just to stop people from talking about the fact that the best way to get them is to buy them, you'd have to do minigames for days to choose one special option. Also, I'm getting same character syndrome vibes from the characters lately, the guy in the thumbnail looks like the one in Lethal Engagements and several other characters look too much alike.",
            "I love the game and all but i just can't get over the amount of gems you have to spend in the game, i hope atleast it'll be lower. I love the Mc, she isn't annoying,stubborn & 'thirsty' i like how she's smart,confident,& understanding. I also love the characters designs, I'm looking forward to your upcoming games.",
            "The artwork is amazing, very well desctipted. Now I have to do it two more times to see what the ending with the other charactars are like. Well done it's a great game. They all are, they all give me goosebumps at the end and you really feel like your the girl in the story.",
            "Too difficult to choose! The male characters are all stunningly gorgeous and have their own charms. It is too difficult to choose one! Amazing!",
            "Once again the story is amazing it makes sense, the artwork is truly beautiful and well honestly You all are one of the best story telling apps on the app store. You always seem to be better then the last story and honestly you all have come a long way since you first started.. Thank you and keep up the amazing work🥰❤"

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "I really loved the atmosphere of this hauntingly beautiful game, and the gorgeous soundtrack really helps the immersive quality. I must admit, though, that most of the puzzles were too hard for me to solve without outside help. There was one glitch for me on my samsung tablet. The inventory boxes were directly over the symbols at the bottom of my screen that allow me to go to the tablet's main page or go back one page. Had to touch the very edge of the box that held the item I needed.",

I found it quite a challenge but I slogged through relentlessly until I got to the stained glass window that featured angels. I have a hard enough time with puzzles of this kind with one free tile, but for me this is impossible to solve and I cannot advance further since there are no skip options in this game. So unless I am given a strategy for solving this puzzle, I must request my money back. 🙂",

Had to try very hard to avoid hitting it by mistake and stay put in a scene), to the meandering sequence. I didn't bother to pay to continue (required very early on, how can they call it free?). Oh and no hints. At all.",
            "I really liked this game. I would have rated 5 stars if not for the few glitches that made progressing impossible. A few of the minigames/puzzles just wouldn't work, even with having the clues to them and doing them correctly. The safe in the office being one of them! I just had to keep exiting the minigame/puzzle and going back into it, trying over and over until it finally decided to work. Other than that, I liked the game!

            "This was adorable! It had really cute characters, art, cutscenes, everything! It was so adorable! I also really like the idea of Kamilla not being sure of what people will think of a Demon dating someone, especially of the likes of Eleni, it's something that people can really relate to, which makes the plot so easy to latch on to. It's amazing in every way possible!",
            "The game was really wholesome and cute, despite not being able to do anything, much less, being too short, it's still a 5 star for me nonetheless. The way of delivery in each dialogue was humourous and perfect, the art style is utterly adorable, the story in general is kind of silly, my personal opinion of course, yet it's still effective enough to be included in my favorites. Wish there was a continuation of this in the future, huge thanks to the developers because this is a Job well done!",
            "So, my main issue is there is not much going on in the story to me. To me, it wasn't as intriguing as all your other stories so far. But it was enjoyable nonetheless, despite not being as good as your other stories imo. Pretty neat story",
            "Oh. My. God. I love this! The premise was great, the art was adorable and the music was on point. My only complaint is that there wasn't more of it. I've downloaded some other games by this developer (her tears were my light, Disaster Log C, etc.) and they're all awesome! KEEP IT UP!!!!",
            "This was pretty fun! I enjoyed the art style and the story was pretty funny and it was an enjoyable experience. My only little nitpick is it was a bit short for my tastes,but for something that is free and without ads that's something I can respect. I have really enjoyed this read and it was certainly uplifting."

            "Been playing this for a while now. I really want to keep playing and enjoy it. However, stay away from this. It's so horribly optimized it's basically unplayable when there are more than a few things on screen. I have a Pixel 3XL and this game is not playable at the lowest setting. To make matters worst, dungeons and bosses are basically one to two hit kill in most cases. Good luck dodging anything at 10fps",
            "Good game. I got into it late and had a struggle when I was level 20, took some time and learned more about the game and started playing with friends and now I'm almost level 200! With my day to day life its hard to play everyday, but when I get back into it I don't want to stop! There is a lot going on in the game aid hard for ms to keep track but always have a good time! If you haven't downloaded yet, give it a shot <3",
            "This game looks fun, that is if I could actually play it. I've downloaded and installed nessesary files required to run it. I've had to clear space up and then reset the game in order to fix the download process. Yet the funniest thing is I still can't play it. I used to play this on a LG Aristo. And now I upgraded to a Stylo 4. Sadly even with a upgrade it seems this game won't work. All I ever see is a screen of blackness and the repetitive music playing in the background. Feels bad man.",
            "Love the game, but its pay 2 win. Played for about a year, fell in love, realized its potential, realized how much money i had to spend to keep up. Played world of warcraft and got more mounts then i can ever get in this game, for 1000x cheaper. Thanks for the fun times, but save your money. Please save it.",
            "Hm... after 3 years of plaiyng il fell like il leave game. Crashes, disconnects , lags, slow moving engine and so and so. Beside that they got the a very bad customer service if you are ftp user elsewhere let's give money to netmarble . Done guys . I think il start playing super mario back again beacouse of you're attitude to the game . Il say it again ! GAME SHOULD BE PLAYABLE NOT PAYABLE."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "Just started playing beat 1st mission and then it bring me to my amour and say tap and hold to see details and nothing happends when i do. I played the 1st mission 2 times because when i beat it the 1st time the whole app crashed.",
            "Game sucks now. You upgrade your gear for nothing. Even if you you cannot beat the top strongholds. It's a total RIP off now. Have fun spending your money for nothing.also the event sanctum is a RIP off. You get nothing but evolution material. Have played sanctum for water wing armor since it started. Like 7 months ago. Never got wings from sanctum. Am going to quit. Rather spend 500 to 1k on a game that gives you a real upgrade. This game is casino to take your money that's all.",
            "Great game. But the lengthy introduction takes me from one mission to the next without a break, I try to explore while I'm doing the missions, but end up getting mission complete and get forced away to next mission before I finish exploring. For first 20 minutes of game, I am forced to choose the actions it directs me to, and not allowed to take a moment to asses my items, equipment, abilities, etc. Need time between missions to organize my character as I see fit. Needs free roam option.",

            "I love it! It's just as enchanting & relaxing as the original! 😍",
            "I love this app!! Its so fun and gives you goals. But I wish there was a way to make friends, as in having a friends list with others who play the game. It would be so awesome if we had friends we could share pearls or trade friends with. Idk how hard that would be to add to the app, but it would make it so much more fun!!! Again, love ❤ love this game. Thank you tap tap!!",
            "I love this game! I have only been playing it for 15 minutes and it is SO calming. Would recommend ☺️",
            "Really enjoy the game and it's pretty relaxing. My one issue is I saved up 2,000 pearls to buy the white Arctic fox. When I created it, it didn't show up. I can't find it anywhere on my iceberg or in my animal inventory. *Update* I was compensated for my purchase and was able to create the Arctic Fox. Thank you!"

            "You will see s lot of comments from people in regards to logging out of the game with a healthy chip balance only to log in the next day for them to be gone. I'm afraid this is common with huge, many people I know on the app have had their chips stolen with no reimbursement, myself included. 3 years ago they changed the lottery. When they did, I had 3 gold and 1 silver. Today, all that time later, I still have 3 gold and 1 silver. Do not waste your money on these in particular!",
            "Things are looking up. Still hard to get Gold puzzle pieces, but maybe that will change too. I hate the pop ups, but I gotta admit, I do love the games. I recently had an issue, and usually if you complain, nothing get solved, but FINALLY, Huuuge took care of it. Like I said ,things are looking up. I believe in giving credit where its due. Keep it up. Diamonds are useless, I wasnt looking or asking for them. GOLD PUZZLE PIECES is what I was talking about. I havent finished a GOLD PUZZLE.",
            "Even with fake money to be won you'd think the slots would at least keep it interesting so you can play for a bit. It's a major rip off if you spend real money. Also they've tightened the frequency of acquiring a bronze,silver or gold puzzle piece. You'd think they wouldn't be as tight as real slots since,after all...it's fake money. So for that... I'd give it less than one star if possible.",
            "Everyone do not even waste your time on this game, Its fixed. Its designed to make you spend your hard earned money and there is no getting ahead in this game. The very start you win a lot and then once you get into it, they take all your coins. You bet $200. Spin 3 times and win $5 ..its so obvious. Then if you email them and or write a review, some homosexual will respond with something so retarded like, keep trying maybe your luck will change.. trust this review and just run away. Its trash",
            "If you want a real view of this app doing its job look on YouTube for huuuge casino (huuuge ripoff) it is designed to prey on individuals who spend money make in-game purchases. If you spend a dime on this game youll regret it. It has good games but the expense it ridiculous and idiotic. Based on real slots well real slits pay REAL MONEY you dont but your game requires its players to pay to play. Or you could use your 2 spins worth of (freebies) a day.... dumb!"

And when asked if you'd like the information repeated you get the disgusting option of telling the character it would be better if he raped you! They try getting past it with a content warning for \"adult humor,\" but it's just a poor attempt at an edgy joke that's horrifically unfunny.",

            "Update 5.0 replaced most battles with \"skips\". Turn the game on, Skip 700 battles, auto-pvp for 10 times in 2 modes, turn it off. As for guild war, the same pay-to-win guild has been #1 since the game's launch. The devs really need to balance things so other people have some chance. Anyone who tries their best to get that gw win just once will be sorely disappointed and might as well go play something else. Same people are always #1 in all other modes too. It's a joke.",
            "Played this game for a couple of years. It was fun! But, I slowly saw it go from time2win to pay2win. I used to just let my phone run so I could grind the best 6 star armour. Every now and then they have specialty characters I would purchase for a couple of bucks. Nothing expensive though. But now I can't even fight bosses w/o paying for a \"skip\" token? I can't even get the option to choose valor like I did before! Welp, guess it's time to move on to another mobile game.",
            "I really enjoyed this game for several months and it was the only one of these types of games I spent money on. it has been a generous game and the one experience i had with customer service was good. The latest patch however 5.0 i think, was a disappointment. It took the fun out of it for me. Adding new features is generally a positive, but not when you overwrite other features. It made it ungrindable. I haven't really been interested to play after trying the new update.",

I consider the developers need to give us the option to chose between skip and use valors. Thanks",

New unit every other month that is broken so they can release the next one to control it, rinse and repeat since the beginning if the game. Now with 5.0 update they completely gutted the game of what made it unique. Add in the worst type of content in gacha: gear/rune crafting. Materials for this type of content dominate drops from gear/rune dungeons, crafted gears/runes are notoriously worse than farmed version"

            "I love the story so far, but the amount of free game play you get is ridiculous! To play a 1 minute scene, you have to watch 6 adverts, the ads are longer than the game play you are given!!!! You then have no free game play until the next day! This is slowly making it boring. You should provide at least two free passes every 3 or 4 hours like other games so we can enjoy this or its going to have to be deleted which is sad as i want to continue, but its going to take too long!!",
            "I do wish we could read more for free each day. Honestly so far I find Dan to be a bit of a creep.... but I enjoy other games from this developer and the story and graphics are pretty good. I would definitely recommend and I am hoping my opinion of Dan will change as I progress through the game.",
            "I first tried out for Cary vut the ending was sad af. Then the second time, I tried aiming for Dan's ending. But the game keeps making my character go weak in the knees for Cary. WTH?!?! Like is my character that stupid to always accept things from Cary then go to Dan lying about everyrthing that has happened between her and Cary?! THE SCRIPT SUCKS IF ANYONE TRIES TO AIM FOR DAN'S ENDING. CHANGE IT! IT IS REALLY PISSING ME OFF HOW STUPID MY CHARACTER IS!",
            "it seems pretty okay story wise but the text is not fast enough it's too annoying for me to put up with. For future apps remember to make the text faster at one tap be able to go on and if the player miss something or want to reread add a log or history of some kind.",
            "love the app...but...i deleted it after 7 days...yes!it was great...i felt touched by the stories...and there was nothing wrong...but...i chose a episode called the winter kiss...i got very attracted to it i felt as if it was me who was in the story...but the ending shocked me and filled my eyes with tears...i wanted to move on but it was not easy...everytime i open this app i feel sad and incomplete my favourite episode was done..and has a horrible ending...so as im typing im gonna delete it..."

Yeah the graphics are pretty good but you can see all the pictures because you have pay to progress.Plus you dont know how many stars you have or are spending! 😵 Please do something about this!",
            "The game isn't bad and the graphics is good but I hate the stars system thing, but overall, it's not bad",
            "Despite some bugs - like the game jumps sometimes between French&English & some grammar mistakes the story is incredibly powerful. Certainly this interactive novel costs money & that might be for students painful. But people who work need to make a living. I wrote a book myself & plan to write more. This here inspired me - I cried even being 45 years old. Why? Because it could have been my story. I've been in a coma; strange things happened - so 5 stars - gay young love is powerful!",
            "This game is beutiful. The background, the characters, all that, but everytime im in a chapter it tells me i don't have PA. That's bull ok! I don't like that, and it's so slow. Also i hate it when a video pops up everytime i'm doing something it's annoying. You're game is cool, but so anoyying!",
            "Not even sure where to start. I was so hoping this would be a good game.....its not. who knows, it may have the best story ever. however, I'll never know. by the time you get a few moments into anything the game says you are out of in game currency. without paying IRL money the player doesn't get very far without having to wait."

            "its okay, but you need so many gems to get the stuff and like you got to wait THREE HOURS, to get only TWO ticket things to play again. Also when you finish a thing it only gives you ONE gem. Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",
            "I like how many stories there are and that you can choose where the path takes you but I do not like that all the more well thought out stories have so many choices that are gems. Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

            "All say that the game is nice but the ads are to much . U can turn off your net or Wi-Fi . In tab it will not work the idea of turn off the net. From my side this is very nice game . In this game one thing that i don't like is that the sound of the kart during the moving . Except this all the things are vry nice . I enjoy this game while playing. I love this game.",
            "Its a great game, it took me awile to find mostly everything but a really good game, I loved running over rod with the kart",
            "big problem with the ads there's no no ads and you can't purchase no ads so yeah that's my number one problem but my the worst thing of them all is the fact that it's a copy off of granny every the house everything they're like the room is the same as Granny's after the first chapter and then the second one sucks the third one's the only one that actually really good with no where you can actually get no ads and that's probably about the best thing three and I recommend the game."

            "I like the gameplay so far but the controls are too clunky. The on screen joystick doesnt seem very responsive and is hard to navigate (maybe option for sensitivity) . If I could have a wish list for this game it would be the option of stylus controls like in stardew valley or crashlands. I really want to like and play this game but the contols are preventing me from truly enjoying the experience",
            "So far an enjoyable game and it seems like there's lots to do, the controls are a bit wonky/floaty, but I've seen worse. Played on my tablet 1st, where it constantly crashed, but I tried it on my phone with more RAM and it's fine. Found a bug, tho; the stone shooting worm monsters in the swamp/jungle sometimes don't die, the health bar empties and disappears, but they keep shooting and digging around. It's really annoying.",
            "Seems fun, but the biggest downfall would definitely have to be the controls. Its awkward trying to mine or attack things. Its kind of like you have to side step around everything to hit it. I feel like the Sprite wasnt made to go in all angles so that's why everything always has to be hit on the sides only.",
            "This game is CRAZY! I mean, you can *takes deep breathe* crafting, mining, hunting, collecting, farming, cooking, build house, burn mummies, using leash to capture animals, using leash to capture HUMAN, tame animals, let your tiny tamed animals fight DRAGON, breed animals, kill skeleton and fight their ghost, died, tired, sleep, running on water and being chased by shark, let your animals fight shark, running blindly at night, chased by bees.. CONS: Controls kinda suck PROS: You can use joystick",
            "It's listed as an offline game. I've been playing it offline for a month. Now it insists I need an active internet connection to verify license check. If an active online connection is required then remove the tag calling this an offline game."

            "Hey guys! I love all the Rusty Lake games which I just finished playing through. I would like to lodge a small complaint however. I am colorblind and most of your games have at least one color based puzzle. And it sucks. It sucks so much. They ruin the mood of the game for me. These reduce me to guessing or on one occasion googling the answer. Please keep the many colorblind gamers in your thoughts for future projects!",
            "I love this game sm. Before it was officially out, it was already on my wishlist. it's really fun and challenging. Although, it is pretty short. I mean I understand it takes hard work to complete one game, but I think itd be better if it were longer. No other complaints! I love the designs, sounds, background story, it's just all put together nicely., I love games like this!!",
            "I'd love to give more stars but I think there's a bug and I couldn't find a way to keep playing. I looked it up online and have seen a few comments of people with the same issue: on day 4 the doctor comes and goes but doesn't drop anything and even after entering the correct password in the computer it says error and nothing happens. Any ideas or fixing would be appreciated",
            "Love all the Rusty Lake and cube escape games, but I don't understand what makes this one worth $2 when most of the other ones are free? The longer, more in depth ones like Paradise and Roots I understand paying for. But this took me less than an hour to complete and without having to think much. The numerous cube escape games were free and more fun/challenging, while this one was paid for and fairly boring.",
            "I have loved all of the Rusty Lake games and do not begrudge paying for this game. It was beautifully drawn but I felt that none of the puzzles were at all difficult, so it felt very much like going through the motions. The other games have been very tricky at times and you had to figure it out on your own, whereas here every puzzle was spelled out for you. Also, it wasn't as ominous and spooky. Good, but I was hoping for more. Like I say, loved every other game from Rusty Lake."

            "Something is wrong with this game. Almost nothing works and I can't even tell what most things are supposed to be. There are no instructions. No labels on buttons. I was able to find a few buttons that did something among all of the different screens but that's it. One dramatically increased the coins per tap. I then tapped for quite a while to see if somethijg, anything, would happen. Nope. Especially frustrating as the buttons do behave like they are working. Art style is nice, unique.",
            "Itd be neat if there was a button that stops the story slides every time you reset Also (might be my phone not sure) I cant always access the leaderboards Also I think the pets and or backgrounds shouldnt get repeated unless having multiple give some boost another thing it would be nice if master beggar stayed active or paused or maybe like half speed when you go over to other tabs rather than just not letting you go to other tabs and a master beggar upgrade that costs gold potions would be cool",
            "Good app. The grammar is a little bit bad. Not all. Please make a free coins by watching ads. Also the potion. Please 5 or 3 potion per ads pls. Thankyou. Your apps is good. Edit: TY for reply. Hm I also want to ask if can you please make a button where we can on and off the thing below the trainer, i mean the option. So we can play it full screen. Its hard to click when phone is small. Please. I really really love your app. Im willing to watch ads to support you guys. Hehe. Staysafe!",
            "Amazing game! I've spent about $45 on it and I have to say it was money well spent. The grammar's a bit off, but I believe it's the translation. It's a tapping game, you can earn potions to benefit you (or buy them), you can hire people once you get enough coins to get money for you, you can customize your character, the background, and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Overall, really great game!"

I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",

Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

            "It's a fun, clicker game also great to pass the time. It's not a complex super story based action rpg game. However its simple and rather fun. If you need to pass a large amount of time. I would suggest this game definitely to a friend. Who not looking for anything fo complex story or super high open world multiplayer type game.",
            "Very nice game 5 stars. Still a decent amount of people who play boss hunt. Easy to pass time and play offline if you wish. Developers listen to help make the game better for player experience. Plays smoothly. The ads to get extra items such as cash or tokens or even gems helps you progress through the game a lot faster. Well done with that keep it up",
            "It's a shame really. I love this game, but you spend more time watching adds than playing. I've left the game a few times and come back hopeful it had gotten better. Nope, worse if anything. Not sure it's even really been updated in a long time either. Plus the timing on your taps are strange at times.",
            "My Knight hasn't stopped for 4-5 Years. Bought a new phone. Just reloaded the game. Trillions in bonuses to unlock. Nice. Nice to watch. You equip him with Swords n fancy weapons. You control the buffs in the fight. Lazy way to play, but still good entertainment.",
            "Guess you could say the gameplay is so fun (& offline) it gets addicting... least it does for me.. Not a lot of hype to buy stuff either, so naturally = 5 stars!!!"

Not a single purple or yellow besides the one they gave for free. Quite sad to of spent money for literally nothing. I know it's all chance, but I personally wont be attempting this again.",
            "If there is a single game that I have enjoyed thoroughly through the years and have never been frustrated with, its sdorica! From the music to the story (which is a 12/10!!!) You cannot go wrong, give it a try!",
            "Im giving this one star because while I adore this game I can only play on wifi. I have a good 4g connection on my galaxy s9 plus and it keeps asking for a stable connection. Please fix this its terrible and straight up ruins the game for me. Ill delete this post and give back my 5 stars once this is resolved.",
            "The game is beautiful, i've playing for a long time now. But today is different. After i open the app and tap to start, it went pitch black and never showing the game. Please fix this, and i will give you back my 5 star",
            "I dont usually do reviews so I'll keep it short because this company deserves something for its hard work and after playing for almost two years this game is probably had one of its biggest updates just recently so its clear that they really do care about this game and want to keep it revelant and entertaining, and I really mean that despite sounding like a review bot."

            "I couldn't get past the menu. I tried restarting the app a few times and it still wouldn't work. When the logbook menu loaded, the screen started flickering like crazy. If I was epileptic I probably would've had a seizure. The game keeps crashing, even on my other device. It's been nearly 2 hrs and I still cant play. But game looks good, so I'll rate it 3 stars at least.",
            "This game is a great resource/idle type game. The ads aren't intrusive, the art design and sound are great. This is a perfect pick up and play type of game, with the random events and nicely tuned progression more than making up for the relative lack gameplay. The in-app purchases are fairly done as well, never feeling like you're being forced into them, but also being a great way to boost impatient players. Definitely give this game a try!",
            "This is a fun little time burner and the aesthethic is charming. Gameplay is cathartic when things are made. The character are unique and give a retro feel. However this game is a bit lacking in depth, logic, and personality. For starters the equipment system is a bit rubbish, when a character get's something new, the old piece is lost to the void. It's a bit counterintuitive when survivor's can't be wasteful. It would make more sense if the old tool broke and the option to make a new one.",

            "it's still buggy. getting worse, even. the more I use it, the more it crashes and lags. I would rather have that fixed than a new design. and now the coin purchase isn't working either, and sometimes tapping the heart to like does nothing. there was nothing wrong with the layout, please fix the bugs. I want to be able to read the comics. even now, I would like to be able to buy more coins and I literally can't",
            "Firstly, I saw many, many advertisements on instagram for this app and decided to give it a shot. And I'm in love with webtoon now. No joke. There are a lot of other web comic apps, but this one seems to be the only one without a pay wall from what I have found. You can buy coins to read ahead with a fast pass, or be patient and wait for weekly updates on many of the series. Overall good experience and lots of amazing stories.",
            "Honestly, while I do enjoy this app, I'm kind of annoyed that they removed the option to buy $20 worth of coins. That and I get they need to make money, but let's be realistic here, the whole \"one free comic a day of comics that are completed and were once entirely free to read in a day\" thing is kind of meh. You can pay to read them more often, even though the comics again were ENTIRELY FREE BEFORE. You wanna read a 70 chapter story? You have to do it over 70 days, unless you wanna pay.",
            "I love the contents of this app, but I can't ignore the constant glitches. One of the worst ones is that I have participated in 2 seperate events for free coins, and when I went to collect my reward it glitches and I lose out on the free coins. As far as I can tell there is no way to contact them when something like this happens. A Google search for support just takes you to there FAQS forum which doesn't help. I guess use the app, but don't bother with the events.",
            "I used webtoon nearly daily about 6 months ago, then my phone broke and I had to wait to get a new one. I forgot about Webtoon, but once I remembered it, I was excited. All my favorite storys must have gotten tons of new episodes. And then, the new Pass was revealed. I didn't mind fast Pass,Daily pass is stupid. Part of the charm to the comics is that you can spend 30 minutes sitting down enjoying your story chapter by chapter. Now imagine taking all of that away, to 1 chapter. Very short read."

            "When I run AV, it says \"risk found\". Doesn't tell me what the risk is, where it is, what to do about it. So your AV just finds the problems but doesn't do anything about them? According to the developer, it's supposed to tell you which file is affected but it has told me nothing but that a \"Risk Found\"... that's it, nothing else. Not helpful and it doesn't get rid of the problem, so the app remains useless. Still one star.",
            "AVG gives really comprehensive virus protection for free. OK there's ads which I'm prepared to put up with and actually some are interesting. AVG also offers extra protection (which isn't free) like secure VPN but the costs of the extras don't seem to be that much. There's also an AVG deep clean app which is free and that's also very good. All in all I'm very happy.",
            "All services I have ever used with AVG have run smoothly and performed as advertised and promised. I am using the free service now b/c of pandemic budget issues. I eagerly await the time that I can enjoy and feel even more secure and protected with the bundled pay services. Customer service over the years I have used AVG services has ALWAYS been warm, professional, , and acutely knowlegable about their products. Impecable service apprecited beyond compare = THANK YOU!!!",
            "One of my apps sends a PopUp with a message that my service provider UICC is not valid every 3 minutes!!! Very annoying! But otherwise, my phone works perfectly well, and nothing is wrong with the UICC. I purchased AVG antivirus pro, and AVG Cleanup, and NONE of them identified the issue nor fixed it! I am angry and i want my money back!",
            "i only got the app maybe 10 minutes ago but wow! i had some sort of malware on my phone that kept sending me to my settings and telling me to turn install on, if i did turn it on i got pop ups telling me to enter my bank details and if i tried to turn it off again i got sent to my camera, which made it almost impossible to close. anyway i got the app, did a scan and within 1 minute it found the issue and got rid of it. couldnt be happier!!!!"

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "Absolutely stunningly beautiful game. A piece of art in video game form and easy to maneuver. Though the different obstacles & beautiful scenery coming at me at such a fast pace made me dizzy & semi nauseous. It's sad because I really could've delved into this game for hours on end. The music is relaxing as well. Keep doing what you're doing Noodlecake studios!! 5/5",
            "Another beautiful adventure with Alto & friends, don't miss out on this amazing fun game, challenging slip & glide fast ride down slops scoring high points along the way by pulling off a few flips & tricks!! Love the beautiful scenes backdropped behind with a wonderful soundtrack, super chill, wicked game, I love Alto characters, this game rocks!!",
            "Really fun, it's the same, just running but the challenges can be difficult so it's not bad at all. I always play it on the bus to school because I don't have mobile data so I can only use non Internet stuff. This is really good and you should install it.",
            "Developers, I really love your game but i have some ideas that may do this game better. I think it's a good idea to add all the features of Zen mode in a main mode because the combo score and another numerals distract you sometime and this beautiful musical composition from Zen mode deserves to be heard in a simple mode. And the second idea is to add kilometres score in Zen",
            "The ads ruin it! Clicking X still opens the ads!!! FIX IT! The game itself is nice and fun, ads finance it, makes sense. But these ads are too often (debatable) and when they are done, clicking the X to get back to the game opens them in the browser. This is borderline harassment! A second click after. going back to the game app, clicking the X closes it. So it is intended by the developers to get more money as your click is now also triggering their website. FIX IT, this is cheap!"

I enjoy the game the story is gokd but the only thing i don't really enjoy is trying to get you to attack other schools it goea against the story and all i usually do in theae games is try to make friends with other alliances to build up reputation. But i tried that last time i played...did not turn out as well as expected",
            "The game is great but I do have one problem. Some players are super rude and inappropriate. Can you add a report player button so that interactions can be monitored by the developers and limited to friendly?",
            "I started to play this game 3 years ago. It used to be fun and rewards from events were easy to get but not anymore. If you want to get all those stuff you gotta need to spend money. Devs keep releasing new stuff and new stuff means spending tons of money again. I honestly don't know why players still spend so big in this game when bugs are so terrible. Instead of fixing it, they are making it worse. No matter how f2p grinds all day, still not enough to keep up. Don't play this game.",
            "I have come to like the interaction between commanders. You will be surprised who just might help you. What I don't like is how the game incurage attacking other schools... That seems to be the real purpose of this game which is against the story!... And its no wonder they have to revise the cities because it gets really bad! To where no one has any compassion for their nieghboring schools."

            "Is it horror game. Only going from one to another place, you don't have to use mind, just get thr key and open the door. It is kind boring and repetitive. Not this game, all the horror series game of your studio. Story is ok but not mind grasping",
            "Much better than the first ver!!! Characters walk faster and there is more detail in the notes and background. I liked J's play through more. The switchs part on the first characters route was very hard to solve, as way the clock in J's \"time machine\" room. I ended up giving up after trying everything. I think the hints need some work. Great improvement! 👏⭐⭐⭐⭐s!",
            "Well i guess this would be the definitive version as it comes with the first game plus a little DLC type story, you'll get to see what happened through another characters perspective but theres nothing new in terms of gameplay or endings really. Still quite an interesting game and story and I appreciate having a little extra game and story to tie up loose ends. Try it out! to see my review of the first go see Horror on the Doodle Rush page",

            "Great game but guild chat is lacking and not linear. It should be obvious and on top of that, the game does not support landscape view, which is a bummer. I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",
            "The game is all about pay to play. If you try to play it for free, you'll get so far behind that it is ridiculous. The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend £95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend £95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . 👍",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

This might be something that is simple to resolve, however that is impossible too know as there is literally 0 customer support. Could have been a great game, but instead it sucks.",

I have a brand new phone (6Gig RAM) (125gig ROM) that should keep the battery for the whole day. But if I play this game. I have to plug in the power bank so I don't loose and power...

            "This is an amazing app! I use it every day!! My primary use for this app is reminders because my memory is so horrible. I have a reoccurring reminder to even set an alarm every night. For most of my reminders I need room for further notes or instructions, so this app works great for me. I make lists for various things and I really like that there's a feature that you can check things off on the list. It's satisfying to finish something, tap it, and its automatically crossed out.",
            "I LOVE color note!! I have used it for several, several years now, with multiple phones and it has transferred seamlessly to each one. I like it so much better than any other note app I've ever used. I still have a note saved on my app from 2011 when I went into labor with my daughter and I was timing contractions. This app is simple, user friendly, has convient options to use for shopping trips, work list, ect. This busy mom of 4 HIGHLY recommends!",
            "No way of backing up anything whatsoever unless you sign in with a Google account. In 5 years I've not had any issues with this app until now. Everything in the backup section has been disabled to force me to backup online with a Google account. The entire offline backup section no longer works, even signing up with an email address is broken and redirects to Google. I would've said these are bugs, but the offline backup section says 'sign in required' so I'm not so sure.",
            "This app is a must for maintaining notes, catalogues, & other items that require a checklist, without being bothered by pesky ads or such. It is overall fine, only thing is that it sets the very first of line of a note as the title of the note which is undesirable at times. Is there any option to do away with this? Recommended app.👍👍",
            "I've tried other notepad apps and this is my favorite. The color coding feature is extremely helpful, as is the fact that the notes are automatically saves as soon as I exit the program. Even better, my notes are synced across my devices so I never lose anything. This app does everything it's supposed to do, and does it well, without any obtrusive ads or annoyances. That, in my opinion, earns it five stars."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Full of bugs, why replace a working app with this? Too many bugs to cover. Volume drops until the app decides to randomly pause. When expanding from letterbox to fullscreen, the aspect stays in full screen untill it pauses randomly, then, when play is pressed it stretches across the x axis, leaving the black border of letterbox while stretching horizontally. On top of that, I have never had a smooth experience trying to download and of my 250+ purchases.... Wifi or cellular",
            "Just installed itself one day. I can't uninstall and if I try and put it in a folder the next time I open my phone it always reappears somewhere else on my screen. I don't need ANOTHER streaming service. Y'all already rich, you don't need another app, especially since I didnt want the app to begin with, nor did I approve its download.",
            "One thing that I like about it is that I can limit my searches to only \"free\" movies, so it limits it to my current subsctriptions, but it would be nice if you could do that same limitation when browsing by genre. I have so many subscriptions, I'd like to limit my browsing to those subscriptions. Also, how is YouTube TV not one of the supported services? You're literally the same company!",
            "Disappointed! This review is for the Google TV dongle. I was excited about it. But it hasn't lived up to expectations. My biggest drawback is the lack of \"Continue watching\" on most apps. This device was supposed to consolidate all of my contents in one place but it doesn't. I hope an update can rectify it. The outlay and ability to disable contents from apps one doesn't use will be great.",
            "I like the upgrade, but when I'm offline, it doesn't want to show my TV show library. Instead, it says \"Start your own collection\". I already have a collection. It can show me my movie library, but not my TV show library. It doesnt even show the content I've already downloaded to watch offline, unless I get connected to the internet to do so."

But of course, I don't have any gems and gems cost real money. And, there's no way to earn gems through game play, so no more free spins! We'll see what happens from here, but I may be deleting this game.",
            "Good game. Few things I didnt like was it forces me to use my extra help options on the beginning of the game. Or even forces me to use boost energy at the start when I dont even need it! They only give you three gems so you would buy the boost energy but it costs 6 gems!! I tried to end game so that I wouldnt have to buy it with my gems. But then it forces you to use your gems to continue. Level 24.",
            "Please add the new features in the next update of the game, game data save with social accounts and improvements on UX design like the main lobby display with the fresh new look! And one more thing please add more characters in this game. Next, please label the game levels with colourful background with difficulty indicator on the level number for example, no indicator for easy levels, skull indicator for hard levels and horned skull indicator for super hard levels just like Candy Crush Saga do",
            "After progressing to a certain level, the game gives you colours that you can't use to complete the level. You also don't have enough balls, sometimes by just 1/2 short of what you need. If these problems aren't resolved, I feel to delete the game due to it's frustrating set up!",
            "This game used to be fun. Now I am forever stuck on level 644, because you are only given 25 balls. It is impossible to pass this level with only 25 balls. Help on you tube show 37 balls. You can pass with 37 balls. Fix the game. Fix level 644. Is there any support anymore for this game? Are there to be anymore updates? If not, why?"

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not 😊); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a £iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

You continue to read the story, you make choices, and simply enjoy a romantic relationship with a great male character of your choosing.\r\n\r\n◆The Story◆\r\nWelcome to the Spirit World, a town under the supervision of the nine-tailed fox spirit Tsukumo. \r\nAs our heroine, you wandered into the Spirit World as a ghost roughly one year ago. Without any recollection of how you died, or what your unfinished business may be, you are left unable to pass on. \r\nWhen you were alive, you were the heir to your family’s long-established traditional Japanese confectionary business. But now, with Tsukumo’s assistance, you’ve opened up your own sweets shop as your pass your time in the Spirit World. Set free from the strict disciplines forced upon you as heir to your family business, you are able to remember the joy you attain from making sweets as you spend colorful, entertaining days in the Spirit World. You start to think that maybe you will continue living on like this until you become an Ayakashi, the spirits who inhabit this world...\r\n\r\n◆The Characters◆\r\nTsukumo\r\nA nine-tailed fox.\r\nTsukumo is the animated overseer of the Spirit World, honored and respected by all who live in town. Though he is always trying to skip out on work, deep down Tsukumo is of a very serious nature. He even has a lonely side to him. In true Ayakashi-fashion, he displays unabashed gluttony for that which he desires, but he also possesses a gentle soul. \r\nHe loves the sweets made by our heroine.\r\n\"Mmm, it’s delicious! Your confections are the best in the world!\"\r\n\r\nAkatsuki\r\nAn ogre. Tsukumo's old friend.\r\nAkatsuki is a regular at our heroine’s sweets shop. While he may possess great strength, Akatsuki suffers from an inferiority complex as he is only half-Ayakashi. To compensate for this, he is tenacious about improving his strength.\r\nOur heroine seems to have caught his eye in a way no other has done.\r\n\"Don’t touch me. You shouldn't be anywhere near me.\"\r\n\r\nYuki\r\nA snow man acting as Tsukumo’s aide.\r\nYuki is always chasing after Tsukumo with a stern hand, dragging him back to work when he goofs off. With a gentle, kind personality, he is an older brother of sorts to our heroine.\r\n\"I'll always be there as your brother.\"\r\n\r\nMike\r\nA Nekomata cat spirit who is considered young amongst the other Ayakashi.\r\nMike owns and operates his own bakery, the Cat Cakery, next to our heroine’s shop. Depending on how you look at him, you might think he’s either simply straightforward, or a little naive. Mike loves to compete with our heroine over who can rake in the most sales.\r\n\"Hey! I came to see how empty your shop was today!\"\r\n\r\nHaruto\r\nA ghost who works as a popular waiter at Cat Cakery.\r\nHis almost frustratingly charming personality is tough to put a finger on, making him popular with the women, who he treats oh-so favorably. Haruto takes a liking to our heroine for some reason, and enjoys leading her on, only to revel in her embarrassment. It seems that Haruto has been living in the Spirit World before our heroine’s arrival, but it is unclear why he has become a ghost.\r\n\"We're both already dead, so our lives are over...but I believe we can still find happiness in the future.\"\r\n\r\n◆This Game's Special Feature◆\r\nYou can set this game to Japanese, English, or Spanish and use it to help learn a language.

            "Very disappointed to discover that you have to pay for the main story for each character. The price per story isn't terrible, but it's more than I'm willing to spend on something that may only take me an hour to read. If we were told how long the stories are - how many chapters in each - I would be more likely to spend the money on it. The free preview chapters are pretty good so I would like to read the rest.",
            "This game is pay to play but its honestly not even that expensive. Each character follows the trope a little bit but there are subtly plot twists sprinkled throughout and you also get to learn more about the Mc's past throughout the route. It's got a really good plot so far ( I've only done Akatsuki's route) and is honestly just a solid otome game. That said the Mc is, as always, a bit of a pushover but she's sweet and each of the guys are pretty fleshed out. (Spoiler!) I was a bit disappointed with Akatsuki's route as his rage and violent tendencies are a bit uncontrolled and the Mc is even scared of him at those points. I was expecting the game to address that and have him learn to control his rage and not be so unnecessarily violent but it never resolved that... That's the only reason why I'm giving this game only 4 stars instead of 5",
            "Its a very sweet game! I really love all the character, but the most i like is mike! The rest of the character are very cute too! Please make more game like this! I'm proud of you clarity studio!",
            "The story is too short, not too interesting but at a reasonable level for this kind of game on mobile phone. Moreover, this game is overpriced. I can buy a full game longer and better than this on steam with half the price for all routes of this game.",
            "I think the pricing for the story's is too high because you only get 14-16 eps. The storyline is okay, though I've only read mike's so far."

            "Great game. I have 1 major beef with this game, though. Sometimes when I want to get more coins by watching an ad, the game states that there is none to watch so I can only get only the minimum coins offered I don't know what, if anything, controls this or it's some obscure algorithm deep within the game's programming code or something controlled by whatever process, if any. controls the displaying of ads. It seems this behavior happens less if I don't pay $2.99 to disable ads after each game.",
            "Changing my review from 5 to 1 star as this game is now useless. It just gets stuck loading at the user agreement screen. What a great way to celebrate the 40 year anniversary! *Edit- changing my review. The game is working again. Minus two stars because of the loss of my progress and gameplay latency. Will be changing review as more changes follow.",
            "Update: completely unable to connect to Google Play now, if I could give 0 stars I would! Since the new 40th anniversary update, I can't get past the daily log in screen, the game continually displays a completed task with the coin reward, no matter how many times you click on it, it reappears. Unplayable!",
            "Ads don't load for extra life, constantly loading & only way to get back to game is by closing app completely. Gets really frustrating. Once fixed, I'll re-rate. BOOST REWARDS?

But no matter what, never play alone in the dark.\r\n\r\nYou work as a reporter for a small local newspaper. One fine evening, you receive a message from your friend Ada that something mystical is happening in the vicinity of the Santa Monica Psychiatric Hospital.

But I've a suggestion, maybe you could change the story? Stop telling about Alice. Make another story without Alice in it. Could be great if next mh will tell a brand new storyline. Thanks. Greeting from Indonesia..",
            "Total waste of money. I purchased by watching the gameplay and some scenes were good enough to make me agree to purchase this. Now, I completed 2 missions and the gaming is total boring. You have to find very small clues and keys to move further without a single hint. All you can do is just check and check and check again all the way from start of that level to the point where you can't go further in order to find something you have missed. I would not suggest to anyone to download.",
            "Lol, waste of data, money and time. You can't play it until you see its game play video of every mission before you start that. So many small things that you have to find, without even a single clue, no matter what's it, if you don't get that small thing, you can't go ahead. I wish I could get my refund but, nothing can be done now",
            "Awesome. Bought most of your games and it's good to see how much you improved since back then. Keep going. Minor frame drops, despite the fact I'm using a Note 8, which is not a low end phone, but i suppose in time you'll fix it.",
            "There are many of bugs, I just started to play the game but found many ways that go for nothing. Direct drop into black and nothing, after I tried to go back main menu and continue the game, it restart to the beginning."

The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",

Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "Wow, simply impressed. Well worth time and money. You guys really worked hard, storyline was smooth flowing and kept you glued for the finale. Loved the game. Beautiful, detailed graphics and liked how the main character was not so good of a guy. Partial memory loss worked well with the story. Loved the mini games and puzzles. I solved them all ( I played casual). All the scenes looked and felt right! Thanks ! Had fun.",
            "There's a game breaking bug at the hospital chapter (the part where you're supposed to distract the policeman). I accidentally opened up my forensic kit as I was making the radio call, and now the game won't progress. The policeman refuses to leave, and the car hotspot is no longer accessible. The game was pretty fun up until this point, although I noticed a lot of typos, and a few of the hotspots were occasionally fiddly to tap on. Not really the quality of game I've come to expect from AM.",
            "Pretty good game with decent storyline. Easy to follow, good mini-games, and good HOPs. Fast travel map, collectible pipes throughout, as well as floppy discs. It took me several days to play main storyline but I was playing it on and off and not straight through. The bonus chapter was extremely short.",
            "This is an excellent game, good storyline and the puzzles make sense within the story. It is sometimes difficult to get things to do what they are supposed to which is mildly annoying. I wish I could explain the issue better so it could be fixed because the developers have otherwise done an a great job. Well worth the money!",
            "BORING! No continuity (meaning clearing one/two rooms at a time and then moving on) mini games and HOPs are not fun- not worth your time and money"

This happens a lot and it's super annoying can you please fix this? If you fix this thank you so much I will change my review if so.",
            "Firstly, as soon as I want to screen record the game, it will just stop recording. That's very annoying. I even had the premium features too. For your information, my phone had alot of memory. It had enough for abt 20 videos. So it really isnt because of the memory.",
            "It's a good screen recording app, but it sometimes doesn't record audip that is coming from my phone, like videos or video chats, it'll just record outside audio, like me speaking. I'd like for it to be able to get all of the audio, or have an option for just audio from the phone, outside audio, or both.",
            "This app is good but it did not recored my voice and it was very lagy. i did not even hear my air conditioning and that thing is so loud! And i rate this app a 4/5 because of the listed problems, please fix it if you can! Thank you for your time.

            "Uninstalling because I didn't want any premium but your app cut a lot of my money out from my saving account while I was sleeping for 4yrs premium vip or something. I'd reporting this purchase. I don't know whose fault is this, your company or google, but can you blame me? I just lost a bunch of my money against my will. Please understand. Thank you."

            "Really great game with amazing graphics! It's a nice and immersive horror game. The sensitivity however is a bit unbalanced though. Maybe improve that? Perhaps you should also make a longer and more complex story. Overall great horror game, I would recommend.",
            "If you're looking for a good way to experience horror games on Android, this is one of the games you should give a go. It's easy to play and short but all the elements is there. The only thing I can nitpick about is the cliché of the story but all in all, it is phenomenal to experience especially in your mobile phone.",
            "It was awesome!!!! The first two maybe three jumpscares didnt get me but the rest of the jumpscares came out of nowhere and I damn near peed myself😂😂😂😂😂😂. Though the gameplay was short it was the best horror game I've ever played. I wish I had played it at night though.........makes it more scarier. I suggest yall get the game.",
            "an unfinished hh walking sim of student quality with a nod to vtmb's seaside hotel. about 200 bucks of unity prefab stuck together; then the dev got bored and posted the game confusingly unfinished. and there's no excuse for that. its a walking sim... finish it. there is some delightfully lost in translation writing though... thats about the best part of the game. read them aloud with your best Ivanov impression.",
            "It's okay, the scares are not as scary as I would of hoped. But good game, the only problem is the sensitivity is not good. There low and medium are super high and I like playing on medium, but I barely have control over what I do. But that is just me."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",
            "Was running fine & progressing nicely until it tried to force me to accept a Facebook policy, I cannot accept the cookies as screen won't drag to press accept as screen size has changed, so it means I'm no longer able to send help/ items to friends or ask for help with reports at the end of each case, also feeding pets has changed to adverts only which now takes forever....really disappointed & frustrated so please change it back to 5 min timers & cut the excessive adverts for everything"

            "Super duper really good game , i love all thats in the game , thanks eyougame ! Please create more games like this ! # really love it !",
            "Overall its an ok game, but its a pay to win game, but theres glitches, its hard to get gifts without using money before marrying the first time. Hard to get outfits, arms, and bunch of other stuff. It sucks for people who can't use money on a game. Its based one all jade. Its hard for people that can't play. Also, for paying you get little cp, you have pay heaps of money just for only some cp.",
            "I like it because the grafik is so good and the game is fun too this is best mmorpg ever thanks eyougame❤️👍",
            "Not worth it! Why? Well...I log on as a guest, and realize it's made by the same people of a game I recently tried. I go to their startup screen, exact same placement, different background. I log in. Same setup as everything they've made. Boring and unoriginal to say the least. I can confidently say this game (or any of what they produce) is not worth your time or money. Sorry to be blunt but they are all basically reskins and ripoffs of each other.",
            "Been playing for quite some time now, The game is nice and awesome to play. However as a gamer myself, I've been spending quite amount of investment towards the game which is obviously 'MONEY' to get items, arms and so on. But here's where the disappointments hits, No matter how much we spend still the percentage ratio of getting in events are very low hence it's not the first or second time, It's countless of time spending a huge amount of money to get but still the same. Take note."

Theres clearly lots of towers in the game but i dont want to have to play for 6 months to get them all, at this pace, for me ill probably uninstall.",
            "One of the last updates brought with it an Bad change. One which uses a Ludacris amount of gems. And that would be... The Tap & the idle time upgrades. Which are Essential to the progression of the game. I must ask. Why the change from coins to Premium currency? considering there are 10 Tap upgrades PER Floor. Multiplied by 3 Gems Plus 5 or 6 idle time upgrades If the idle upgrades were Always 5 gems a piece that TOTALS 55 PER FLOOR! ASSUMING the idle upgrades Stay At 5. A piece which is FALSE",

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

In one route, a guy just got together with MC because he felt lonely when his boss tried to match-make them. The supposedly happy ending feels like a big fat lie after finishing the bad end first. LOL. It's good for those who are skeptical in love and want an extra kick in the heart."

            "I love this game it's very entertaining, and fun. Its ok how you can play multiplayer on one device but, the only reason I'm rating 4 stars is because you can't play multiplayer on separate devices. But I do love how this game can also be offline but just a suggestion to make it offline, and online.",
            "The gameplay, the graphics, everything about it is aesthetic. I completed the game within a day. It was a good experience. The music and the sound effects of the game is really relaxing. This is one of those indie games which don't make you go insane for not completing a level after trying it a multiple times. The checkpoint feature in this game is truly a lifesaver, it's one of the things I love about it. Overall, an amazing game.",
            "I WOULD love this game... IF I DIDN'T GET ADS EVERY 45 SECONDS. This free version is UNPLAYABLE. You can't get into a rhythm. UNINSTALLING. Sadly, though. If you die (which is often) = AD If you finish a level (which are short) = AD. START THE GAME = AD! They BEG you to upgrade to the premium version after EVERY event. If you decline, you're punished with a 30 SECOND AD. I compared play time to AD time with a timer. After 20 minutes, it learned that MORE THAN HALF OF MY TIME WAS SPENT ON ADS.",
            "It's a good game, really, but there's a few too many ads. And, as for the premium Badland thing, I'd suggest leaving that at title screen instead of putting it out there every other level. I would love to give this a full five stars, but the constant ads sort of make it harder for me to enjoy the game as a whole.",
            "Great game. Really gave me raymen legend vibes idk why. It's pretty cute and the gameplay is fun but I mean the way if looks is just 👌Don't regret a 5 star and even then the microtransactions are fair. You can play without buying anything from what I know but you can buy to remove ads and to unlock all levels at once which I think you can still get by beating previous ones. Again great game and devs keep up the great work."

Today, 10-05-2020 (Oct.05,2020), I noticed my note had the date 10-25-20, so I tapped that date and changed it do the date (09-25-2020) that appears When I close the editing of the active note. But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",

I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",

However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

            "Great game! It's like it's actually reading your mind, sometimes. But the thing is, whenever I keep thinking about rare things, I never get to see if Akinator actually got them. I hate it because I'm not allowed to buy anything either. Stuff like Asta's sword from Black Clover or Sakura from Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun are a few examples, it always says it's rare and I wanna see if Akinator actually got them. At this point it seems like Akinator just wants money. Please remove the rare thing!",
            "I used to like this game. Then they started charging people who didn't want ads. Fine, whatever. But now, I am not allowed to watch an ad, i just don't get to see the answer without purchasing the ad-free version?! This is stupid. One star until you fix this embarrassment of a once-good app. Also, thank you so much for ruining my childhood. I really appreciate it.",
            "I used to love this app, but I have to give it a bad review. The fact that I have to pay to see a rare character, object, etc is just scummy. You can have a long game going, but the second Akinator decides to take you to that screen, and you don't want to pay, your game is just over. The game is damn near unplayable now. If you want more money, just add some more cosmetics.",
            "It really isn't what it used to be. Ads will load when you're trying to do something, but when you actually want him to guess your rare character they just won't, so that's really pouring salt into the wound of already having to watch an ad just to continue with the game.",
            "The fact that I have to pay to see a character that's rare is stupid. I know its gonna be like this forever which is why I'm not gonna play till I dont have to pay. Might As well get rid of it do I dont waste 5 minutes just to be told to pay for a guess. Horrible Horrible move.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😠"

            "Used to really like the game, but when you compare it to other these types of games (e.g Episode, Otaku, whatever)..well it kinda sucks. For one, waiting 24 hours to get 4 stars is too much in my opinion. Most of the time I can't even finish the chapter. The game really brings out a lot of stereotypes, such as the nerd, the bully, the 'Chad', and the weeb. It's kinda..offending..? Another thing is that I can't choose who I get to like (a lot of people point this out in the reviews) 2 stars",
            "I love this game it's full of amazing stories....but the stars....if only we can watch more than one add to get stars but other than that its😍",
            "Its fun and all but i hate how you only start with ten stars because it would be more fun for me if you got one star every two minutes.",
            "The story is so nice. I ended up with Julian. Make a part 2! I wish I'll have a love story like that!! The game is fine for me since I can just change the time to get stars quickly. Hehe ;)",
            "I give it three stars cause its kinda good but its a little confusing even if u pick the compatible sign u dont end u with the boy and those new outfits arnt there 😑😑😡so now the story should have more chapters or atleast more drama kinda boring but it was ohk all in all i wanna say try better"

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

        "comments": [
            "The game is excellent the problem in most of the games is the ads (even through airplane mode stops them) but this game REWARDS you for watching ads not like you consented to a ad but a ad that just pops up games commonly don't do that and the game deserves some kudos great idle game",
            "I like this game a lot, this is coming from someone that plays a lot of idle-clicker games yeah. But i really enjoy that this one isn't just a carbon copy of all the others. It tries to be its own game, and it shows. The story's friendly, the new features work and are nice additions to the old ones, and the art is pleasing to look at when playing. For technical issues; there are very limited settings and the resolution doesn't fit my phone, so 1-2cm are missing on each side. Hope updates fix<3",
            "Fun, cute game that can sap you in for hours or take little time at all. Lots to enjoy and more immersive than other similar games. Well created characters with fantastic art and a streamlined concept. So far no bugs found either, which is always a plus. This feels well put together and is great to spend some time on. Well made game, lots of fun, super cute, great character design, fairly obvious story, but that isn't so bad.",
            "This is a really fun game with a nice story, but it has 2 major glitches. Both of which are seemingly related to eachother. First, it crashes a lot. It usually happens whenever I try to use a skill. (Mostly any of the ones involving the Automata..) Secondly, a lot of things things will freeze on the side of the screen. Making them completely unusable. I once had Present-San freeze in the middle of the screen because I declined his present. I think this has something to do with the crashes..",
            "The game is really nice, The graphics of the game is smooth and the color scheme of this game is well done and it fits perfectly with the scheme of black and white and accent colors to really pull a good feel without making my eyes sore. And the story seems really planned out as well I enjoy the story and what's going on with it the designs of the characters are also nice they fit well with the lore of the game, 5/5 would reccomend."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

I recognize that people who support the game more via purchases deserve to win, but I just wish Bandai could make the brackets more even (i.e. by player level) instead of totally random",
            "I still don't know why can't log in to the game all of the sudden today. I've been trying for hours but it only says \"Asset acquisition error\". My internet connection is fine (even my mobile data), I still can play other games. But this game is not letting me do so now. It's frustrating. Please fix it ASAP! Also, the game closes forcefully after I try to reconnect a few times. I feel like I'm giving up this game soon IF it still don't fix it.",

And most importantly I loved the fact that I didnt have to wait for 24 hours to read the next chapter. I could read them all in one day. It didnt even take a whole day for me to finish it. It doesnt require any gems or any cash. You can freely read all the chapters. And I loved choosing costumes to wear everyday. I'm really happy I found this game. Everyone should try this. Its perfect. And my choice was Elmon❤.",

When I solve the puzzle and have all of the squares filled in properly, the puzzle still doesn't show that it is completed. Edit: Quick response from developer who is working to reproduce and fix this. Thanks!",
            "I loved this game for its ability to be put aside for weeks on end and then picked up right where you left off. It has taken a LONG time for me to get through all the puzzles, but it was an excellent way to pass time waiting in the car. Once you start noticing patterns, the puzzles get easier.",

(Also I didn't mind the ads. Made it pretty easy to get my fav outfits etc. If you don't get an add, just exit the game and retry, or exit your internet and try again)",
            "At first it was amazing 😍👌 but when I did a remake of one of the episodes it was doing the opposite of what I picked. Then it started freezing up and taking me to ads it has a lot of ads. Overall it was a great game like I loved it until that happened . Also it was slow.",
            "Best story ever . It was so intense and emotional and there was so much action . She had a lot of choices , clothes, hairstyles, love partners and much more . I loved the suspense and everything about it . Best game ever.",
            "Very nice game but when i want to unlock the chapters faster or when I want to chose some dress or something it tells that you should watch a video but whenever i want to watch the video it tells that a video is not available now and that happens every time and also make the game offline and there were some spelling and grammatical mistakes and when the levels are unlocked after one or two hours when i want to open it and play it says you have data loading problem and i don't have net problem.",

If you can catch the ways to play early. You are a winner. Though it won't make you in very top. But still i am enjoying it and i can be in rankings enough though i don't pay. You just need to learn how to play. Its amazing 😁",

Yes, im a dunce who spends willingly, but its because it makes things more interesting to level, but i do have friends who have leveled without spending! Im 800 mil in empire so its great!

            "CAUSED DATA BREACH IN MY EMAIL ACCOUNT! The moment I downloaded this game I got a security warning from my email. I brushed it off as an error on my phone. It has been consistently alerting me ever since. I just logged into my laptop and got a security warning that every account associated with the email I used for the account for this game has been breached and now I have to change 51 passwords! I am very angry because I have spent a fair amount of real money on it! Now it won't even load!",
            "Was good at first, but now it's just a waste of time. No update for over two years, almost all of the chinease players use hacks and cheats and Gameloft doesn't give a damn about it, game crashes daily, community is not helpful. PvP battlefield are overrun by hackers and buggers, basically it's a dead game now. Customer service is also useless, they don't pay attention to your problems. Don't waste your time on this game.",
            "Was good once, came back 2 yrs later and the server was dead. Gutted, i used to love this game... maybe if the developer listened to is players it could of kept going. But by the sounds of it they arent even dealing with hackers in the game and still expect you to come play and spend your hard earned cash, just to then get frustrated with hack busting your balls in pvp zones.",
            "Used to be my favorite game. It took real effort to become a good player. You had to know how to use your skills, LOTS of English speaking players and once upon a time it was updated regularly. Now you've got auto everything (which is great for running to your next quest or an NPC, but ruins the game when it also auto fights for you), servers are mostly empty and the players that DO log on don't speak English and the game hasn't seen a single update in OVER TWO YEARS! Not worth playing anymore!",
            "First this was so Amazing the story cutscene in the beginning was like from a movie. But then the lag Comes in and Ruins it. The Lag here is a very big problem not like in the first game. The downloading sucks so bad why don't just Put all the files in the playstore in the first place? Anyway the new UI looks cool but IT HAS A TON OF MONITIZATION IN IT. Decrease it and the new Inventory looks decent but I prefer the old one. I hope you make Order and chaos 3."

            "A chapter takes so long to load. This is the second day and the chapter still has not loaded. I just uninstalled this game. I'm so sad but angry at the same time. Also I do not apreciate the fact that is Google ignoring me. I really want Google play store to answer my reviews. This game is lovely . I really love the drama in this game so good job on that. It's just the chapters taking long to load. That really ruins the whole experience. Thank you.",
            "It's cool and all, but like a lot of other people, unlocking the chapters take way to long. Also there's way too much adds. I remember playing this in the past and there wasn't that many adds. So hope you can do that. Overall it's pretty good, not too shabby.",
            "I luv dis game, I installed it and wasted my mbz on something else and den I played it Der were no ads except I had to leave and come back coz no mbz I finished chapter 1 and unlocked every chapter I bought a lot of mbz and played Der other chapters. I chose Michael as a boyfriend we visited places and he proposed at chapter 20 I haven't finished chapter 21 yet cool games and Der guys are hot especially Pedro, Anna's online boyfriend I met hot a hot life guard found out Steven is a rockstar and went to prom plz make more games webelinx love story games am a fan I luv it Soo much can u please add another 21 chapters or more coz I don't sleep until am out of Data plzzzzzz",
            "Love this game😍😍😍 It's super exciting and fun❤️ I got addicted with this game. But the one problem of the game is, it takes too much days to download chapters. This waiting kills me😞 please try to fix the problem",
            "Open the app - First thing you get greeted by is an ad. Cannot skip or fast forward the dialogue. Home screen is glitchy, kept opening purchase coins window even though I was clicking on play. Horrible."

            "Game features are really good and detailed. The more I play, the more features I get to discover. Joining alliance and battling with others felt the most innovative and interesting, not to mention making friends and allies just as your game character. There are different means to earn golds too which is rare. There was a huge glitch problem which wasn't allowing me to play for more than a minute or two, but thanks to the developers, it's now solved fully and I can play freely and smoothly.",
            "Really fun game! Different from how it was advertised though, but it's ok. I've been playing for around 157days, and I've been active daily. Many people commented that it's a game that requires money to achieve high ranks, but that's not really true. As long as u put ur resources in the right places, n during events, u'll be able to rank well! Like within the top 100. It's fun to challenge myself n c how high a rank I can go without paying a single cent. :) It's nice to chat with other players!",
            "Money-hungry. Servers die less than a year. I like this game because I met a lot of people and able to be friends with. I do still enjoy this game. The issue is that it really, really, really is a pay-to-win. CME will milk everything they have to offer. They even tweaked the algorithm to give out fewer shards during events. Emperor shards are even more difficult now to get. I have four decent VIP accounts (unlocked all quick buttons) on different servers. Is it worth your money? Definitely not.",
            "Just had the new update and it's disappointing tbh. I get that the game needs to come up with ways to make money so that it can keep giving out great content but can CME at least not make the events even more difficult than they already are. It's true that if you play regularly you will be rewarded but it's tiring and now I'm kind of fed up. Before update I could at least play my favourite Jade for Beauty with ease but now it's a CS event and I've got to be here at all hours to keep up rank.",
            "The new art academy to get a superheroine is a joke. You can't call that a game! I don't have a problem with the cost (even though it's absurdly expensive, it takes $500-$2,000 real money to get a superheroine). My problem is how completely boring it is to \"play\" that art academy \"game\" It just spams world chat with notifications from other players. No one in our cross servers likes the game. Reaction was 1/10, everyone hates it. Who approved of this dumb idea? We need more actual FUN mini games"

            "There's plenty of good slot there but, at the beginning, I was excited to be playing, I went up to 90M and in two hours or so, those slots didn't give me any big wins and I went from 90M to 300 coins in a couple of hours, Im still playing just to see if I can get back the coins, BTW, been playing for two weeks and I never got any big jackpot.",
            "It's a fun game, however I frequently get ripped off when I hit jackpots. It doesn't always give them even if you get them. Also, my boyfriend signed in as a guest and he gets an option to watch videos for coins. I signed in through Facebook and I don't have that option. He gets 17 million per video. Why is this not an option for me? I want to continue playing but if the payout doesn't get better I'll have no choice but to delete.",
            "This is a pretty good game I bought points a few times but usually I can win enough to stay playing as long as I'd like. I think that every app should have a real jackpot or sweepstake, something monterrey . It not something thats challenging, not rocket science. So I feel like its robbing my time. They certainly want to sell. Just give nothing back. Its a scam, really we are the idiots. LOL. Michelle Grace",
            "The best game out there. Just like every game I try, I was skeptical at 1st. They give you videos to watch where your coin awards increase as you level up. Those rewards become very genereous. I havent found any game that comes close. You have other rewards such as slot cards where you get coins for completing albums and use your duplicate slot cards for the wheel of stars which gives you more coins and daily dashes and more free rewards. Their slot games are fun and engaging. Give it a try.",
            "When I first started playing the game it was GREAT, you win some and you lose some. Now they have put a fix on the game to get you to spend more money because it jumps a lot from wins and it's like something was changed. I have played for hours and only won Big 2-3 times."

            "Okay, so I really like this app. It nees work, but it is better than other choises. At least I can make a password lick for my account so nobody can look through. One problem I had was the color change. I was changing the cover color to blue, and It didn't work although it said it was sugsessful. That was the only bug, It didn't even effect me, so this app is good.",
            "This app is incredible and secure plus if you have a password for your phone than it will be double security. And there is no loosing the lock its in your brain. And you can change the background, the font style and the font color. If you forget your password and you are signed in then they will send you the code. Pretty sweet so i recommend this to anyone who needs a dairy. 😇😍",
            "I like the app, it's really good. The only issue I have is the ad banner that tends to appear most of the way up the screen leaving grey. It's a pain to remove. Also, an idea for you... changing the layout of entried or notes. So you can choose for them to stay as they are, be in reverse order or a calendar layout. 👍",
            "This app is amazing, I love the way it is set up! Its always there to listen even though the stories might be boring, its always there to help you get things off your chest. Without this app I would still have stuff to think about and nowhere to go to talk things through. The only problem is that one time it did not save my progress but it was mainly my fault.",
            "Really good. Recommended. It tells you the date automatically and you can changes colour of text and theme by yourself with no charge. You can even change the colour of the app icon if you don't like pink colours. Many much more feature need to check it out yourself. It's free with ads so don't be afraid to try it out yourself."

            "Great game. Superb quality and excellent graphics. The only thing is when you run out of balls and you are sent back to the home screen you cannot continue without the premium bonus. There should at least be 1 more free gamemode or it will get boring. If it gets boring you loose players. If you loose players it will run downhill quickly. Please improve this. If it gets improved I will rate 5. For now its 4",
            "I love this game! It's really good,time eating and fun! The graphics is just out of this world! I just don't like 2 things: 1.the fact that you have to restart the game every time from the beginning (if you don't want to buy premium) 2.when you miss only ONE crystal you lose all multiballs!(and the steps). That 2 facts are the reason I gave this game 4 stars. I would recommend this though!",
            "It's really fun and helps me focus, the music in the background and the sounds of breaking glass is also very relaxing, but one thing i noticed is when they tell you \"checkpoint saved\", sometimes it doesnt let you click on the screen or doesn't detect your fingers on the screen, if you could fix that, that would be great!👌💖",
            "It's a really nice game . N I really liked it just the thing is that u have to take a look at ur balls otherwise it does not take time to be finished 😂 Leaving this the game is perfect. If u r bored u can absolutely play it. It's the best way to time pass. If u r out u will definitely play the other But u will never b full of this game.😁 Play and enjoy the game.",
            "I love this game! The only thing i have a problem with is there's not enough levels. I passed every level, then it goes to endless mode i think it's called. Other than that it's an awesome game, very well made. Side note: i did purchase the premium version, because of how much i love this game!"

            "Similar feedback to most of the other users. Since the update the ads are much more frequent and really interfere with the enjoyment of playing the game. I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",
            "I am so furious! I subscribed for premium for a year and it worked for 3 days. I'm back to getting all the bloody annoying ads every few minutes. I hate it!! And the worst thing is there is no way to report it or contact them.",
            "Used to be great, but now the aggressive ads have killed it. I finish a puzzle in two minutes just to get hit with 2 back-to-back ads. I don't mind some advertising, but it's overkill now.",
            "The app was fine until they got all political. All the commercials have been for one party, like the are trying to jump on the main stream media ban wagon and shove the democratic party down everyone's throat. No thank you and I'm deleting the app. You can keep your one sided opinion."

If you guys do all of the advertisemend and stuffs, Inviting all of the people around the world. Updating this and thst, upgrading and making it looks more great. I'm sure s lot of people like 5 years ago will play this game and we can meet a lot of player. Please......",
            "Im rating this game 5 stars because its just gold. Best mmorpg on mobile its really sad that gameloft left it out because they can make amazing updates to this game like update it not graphicly just content. It would mean a world to all of use old rpg players the game is still alive even when you didn't update for last 2 years.",
            "Order & Chaos Online is by far a great action MMORPG mobile game, this game has lot's of quests, you can customize the character, you can also play this game with friend's, chat, battle, also duels. Their are no future updates as in not coming, with newer ones to be updated. Choices of five characters, Humans and Elves fight for Order, Orcs and Undead for Chaos, Mendels are neutral referred to as the chosen ones. This game uses lots of GB storage. You can also create guilds.",
            "Played from Release on IOS to a few weeks into the last time it was updated. The first few years were a fantastic game and I would still argue the best MMORPG mobile has ever seen was pre level70 cap if not the whole time the game didn't have any sort of paid features. Its a shame they got greedy and gave up on the game if they kept up with it or even pull up old Level 60 servers up to EHL it would compete with the best out right now.",
            "I personally am enjoying the hell out of this game!!! I started playing about 2h ago and ive been glued to the game since it really feels like world of warcraft i haf to give 4 stars though cause the joystick needs some work my guy will just stop runing in combat thats bad cause i dont always wanna fight but steller game guys :D"

            "The plots have very promising ideas, especially with the generous previews they have for each route. The menu is hard to read due to the white and light blue contrast, and sometimes I can't choose the bottom choices. It's a bummer that you have to purchase episodes though."

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "App worked great for the first couple of months. Now it won't track my steps. And if it does, it says that NONE of them are convertible. I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2× boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason. I've re-installed multiple times and it never seems to work. Some days it decides to track my steps though. It's inconsistent, I already contacted support through the app and they didn't do anything to help or seem to care. I do over 15,000 steps per day and I've been subscribing to their 30 coin/month and it's basically been a complete waste."

            "I'm loving the updates! Way better than what it used to be. As a truck driver, this is like always having regular TV available, especially the news and weather channels. I see people complain about the layout and function, but I think that's all on purpose! It looks vintage to go along with the programming. Only gripe would be the variety of commercials, lol!",
            "I'm not sure how this app only has 4 stars. I've been using it for over a month and I have zero complaints. First off.... there's ALWAYS something to watch. The variety of programming is impressive and I am going to say that out of Pluto, Tubi, and Crackle....Pluto TV wins hands down. Movies are unedited which is awesome. Yes.....there are commercials, but they're brief and before you know it, you're back to what you're watching. Visually, the app is beautiful to use.",
            "The app is horrific. It is not user friendly in the slightest. The catagories are horribly unorganized and there is no way to search through them. If you want to watch something, you have to comb through the database by hand until you randomly find what you're looking for. The app's poor design and execution leads to it being nearly impossible to use, which is a shame considering that the concept of a free cable app is great.",
            "Not a one star because this app is great content wise but it has a MAJOR downfall. There is no search feature. Like come on.. I watch the ads that pay for the service but you won't let me search for a movie that I want to see? I can see this app being used by almost everyone but in its current state (which hasn't changed in over a year at least) its useless. Why would I want to \"enjoy\" the old feeling of clicking through channels just to see my favorite movie started an hour ago...",
            "Avoid this app. No search capability so if you know what you want to watch you must waste countless amounts of time sifting through the catalog or give up. To add insult to injury there are way too many ads and they run the same ones over and over. I watched a 45 min show and saw the same Airforce ad 4-5 times. Commercial breaks totaled 17 minutes on top of the 45 minutes of actual show. So ads accounted for 38% of total time which is way too much. Skip this app."

However it's not stylised ( I assume that would need some type of data/WiFi) it would be nice to choose things like skin colour,body type - they kinda just give it to you and their clothing options are very limited too. But good value for 💰,this game is really worth it. Have fun and enjoy 😁😊.",

I finished with 2 but with in 2 they are telling me to connect wifi n connect my internet data to download the next chapter, I connect both internet n wifi but no improvement I can't get to the next move n when I try to click on chapter 3, they tell me to complete chapter 2 first which I already did",

I had to wait at night to load still when I woke up it still had not loaded the game is 😐 not good I won't lie, please correct this. If you do I will give you 5 stars.",

Only thing I can say is that after playing a chapter, we should wait for hours for the next chapter...Anyways this game is really nice",

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

I have had nothing but problems since I purchased this telephone and I've purchased the account prepaid card and I can't Register phone it says the phone number is unknown I'd really like to know what AT&T did to my telephone and why it does not work properly and why they won't correct it I'd really like to know because then they made me pay anoth",
            "Terrible app, please don't ask me to comment again I've made my point!!! Worst app ever!!! I'm not sure if I'm paying for it, but the developer needs to Improve this app before I give it 5 Stars!!! Every time I login, I get message, not available, very frustrating!!!",
            "Does not work most of the time. Never shows correct dates I connect to. All the complaint reviews and from all these people and no response isn't a good response. Please fix these problems",
