            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

They don’t include senior exercise, or seated workouts or a workout for obese people to make fitness truly accessible.  \r\n\r\nIn version 1 of our app, we started with Parkinson’s exercises.

        "description": "Speak Up: An SPL Meter is designed for people that need training modulating or increasing their speaking volume; this can include children with cognitive impairment or children that have a hard time understanding the concept of loudness. Because of the app's flexible nature, there is also a setting to make the app appropriate for adult users, like those with Parkinson's disease.\r\n\r\nThis tool can be used in Speech Pathology therapy sessions in place of a standard sound pressure level (SPL) meter to offer visually appealing feedback, or to continue training at home. The app works by monitoring your voice using the device's built in microphone. As you speak, the app converts your voice into a decibel measurement, which in turn then controls an image within the app. This image moves vertically higher as you speak more loudly and lower as you speak more softly. The goal is to keep the image within the \"Great\" (green) color zone. Users can adjust the ranges of the color zones on a \"Level Input\" screen. This screen allows you to enter decibel ranges for the color zones. This allows the user more flexibility during a training session and also allows the app to be used for a variety of speech conditions.\r\n\r\nCalibration with a sound pressure level (SPL) meter is not required for everyday use, but might be desired for use in a therapy setting. Do this by using the calibration offset features in the Settings menu (see training guide) until the decibel output in the app matches that of the SPL meter.\r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\n\r\n- Kid and adult friendly\r\n- Animated background to give the feel of a bee moving through scenery\r\n- Accurate decibel measurements & visible output\r\n- Ability to adapt app to meet user needs by changing images and decibel ranges for the color zones\r\n- Two fun backgrounds available\r\n- Calibration features to ensure exact measurements (not required for everyday use, but may be desired for clinical use)\r\n- Logging capabilities so you will know how you are progressing\r\n- Detailed training material included\r\n\r\nThe development of this app was supported by the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center for Community Living, Health and Function (LiveWell RERC) funded by a grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (grant no. 90RE5023).",

            "I am an SLP and this app is great visual feedback for loudness for my clients with low vocal intensity. What would really make this app amazing and useful for me everday is if you were 1) able to set a GOAL mark for loudness (such as 65 db) and 2) if it tracked average db over the course of a phrase, sentence, or timed interval.",
            "Does not work just constant 10 db. Yup, I'm experienced and it just flails inline with any adjustments, it's just a novelty item.",
            "this is really useful, any chance you can do an app for my galaxy smartwatch??",
            "I am a SLP and think this is a creative way to measure and track vocal intensity during therapy. Kids will find the bee character interesting and motivating.  For adults, it will be helpful to visualize your target vocal intensity.  Loudness is not tangible so it is hard to know when you are meeting your target. Patients and therapists could use this app for the entire session to determine if they are on track. Helpful for many different patient populations.",
            "What a great idea! Increasing (or decreasing) loudness can be a difficult goal to track and this app provides not only the SLP more tangible/reliable data collection but also provides the patient a chance to improve overall awareness and self-monitor their loudness level. This app is user friendly and can be used with both pediatric and adult populations."

            "I really, really enjoy the app... But I bought the subscription for a year, and it never loaded. The exact dollar amount was taken off my debt card. I'm giving it 4 stars, when normally I would 1 star an app for taking my money. However, their customer support is outstanding!! 🤗 💕",
            "This was recommended to me. I am interested in cognitive health. It was fun and engaging. I can see the benefit of interacting with these games everyday. I want to do more.",
            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",
            "I like the app. The only thing that truely bothers me is that there is not a mute button/setting to mute the music while playing the games."

            "I really, really enjoy the app... But I bought the subscription for a year, and it never loaded. The exact dollar amount was taken off my debt card. I'm giving it 4 stars, when normally I would 1 star an app for taking my money. However, their customer support is outstanding!! 🤗 💕",
            "This was recommended to me. I am interested in cognitive health. It was fun and engaging. I can see the benefit of interacting with these games everyday. I want to do more.",
            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",
            "I like the app. The only thing that truely bothers me is that there is not a mute button/setting to mute the music while playing the games."

            "I recently installed this paid version. But it has following bugs: 1) not working with phone calls with my realme 5i device with android version 10. 2) It uses mobile phone speaker instead of wireless Bluetooth earbuds. So what is happening, even though i am connected with Bluetooth earbud but if my phone is keeping far to me, it produces very slow voice sound as it is using mobiles speaker not headsets. Please fix these two issue, your app is really great, and very helpful to stuttering people",
            "Returning user - I used this app a few years ago and it was superb though became less effective over time so u installed. Reinstalled today but disappointed. Volume slider doesn't work, neither does lowering the pitch. The email link to speech tools us also broken. I'd love to use this app again but I can't use it effectively until pitch functionality is restored",
            "Works well, but would it be possible to add an option to automatically start the auditory feedback when the app starts?",
            "The app is very good. However, I find that when I use bluetooth earbuds, the app keeps using the phone microphone. As a result, the volume is low, and I've found over the years that for DAF FAF to be effective you need high volume, not to hear the sound of your own voice. Personally, I would be more than willing to pay for a perfect FAF DAF app that manages to mask the sound of your voice and guarantees a more reliable experience, and I strongly encourage speechtools to add more tweaks.",
            "It works magic. The only issue that I find (and which is rather important) is that when I use Skype, skype users can't hear me. It seems that it hijacks the microphone.  However apart from that this is a really superb app which is very usefull."

            "Wont open comes to a page saying not found then loops back to google play Update contacted Google for refund, Google said contact developer. Developer says contact google. Thanks for the run around on an expensive non working app.",
            "Very supportive and responsive support. App has an easy to use UI for communication and seems to be quite customizable. The PIN function to restrict changes to settings is very useful. It does install all images locally but that also allows the app full functionality even when not connected to the internet. The app comes with multiple different page layouts on installation, and has the ability to create custom pages as well. However, I did have to explore myself the various settings and options available in the app, and how they changed the functionality and interface of the app. The degree of customization is great, such as custom buttons with personal images and sound recordings for true personalization of expression but these options can feel a little overwhelming for those that are unfamiliar with AAC apps or communication apps in general. Some sort of in app onboarding to help new users customize the app to their communication needs where new users can view the default page types/layouts easily when they first start the app, and a help/guide function or library explaining the different options available to users as far as customization and control goes would be very helpful. If there is a manual included in the application, it is not easily located. Otherwise, this app suits our needs perfectly, and I would definitely recommend this app.",
            "Wonderful speech app and incredible customer service. We've been using Proloquo2go for years and with each new version it is increasingly difficult to use, NO customer support in the US, and is so ridiculously expensive. Our school recommended TalkTablet and we are so much happier now. It has been a breath of fresh air. So much easier and more intuitive to use. No comparison. And the fellow we called at TalkTablet with some questions, before and after purchasing was outstanding 5*",
            "I am a community support worker who supports many people with speech difficulties of different types. This app is by far the best app in versatility, usability, and price. Customer support is the best that I've found, you accually get to talk to a real person if there are any questions which have been far and few in between do to the extreme user friendliness of this app. I can't say enough good things about the creater of this program, it has changed many people's lives.

It is useful in its current state, but with some minor tweaks to how it maintains historical data it could be better. For instance right now it resets the history at the beginning of each week... So every Monday your entire history is wiped out. Generally for what I'm looking for, a difference of a few taps won't matter - I'm more interested in monitoring for CNS fatigue to now when to back off and avoid overtraining so I can kind of remember what values I'm interested in seeing.   It's good that it only takes a few seconds to open up and get a reading."

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.

The app offers you unique 48+ mantas, mudras and meditation techniques for dealing with 48+ types of diseases including chronic and terminal illnesses.\r\n\r\nCompiled by our ancient seers and sages, thousands of years ago, these mantras are powerful sound vibrations that are capable of stimulating certain glands, nerves, energy centres and altering vibrations in every molecule and cell of your body. Each sound has a distinct vibration and energy and hence each mantra has a different effect. As a result a person with any health problem experiences a profound healing effect.  \r\n\r\nMudra vigyan or science of yoga mudras involves simple hand positions or gestures to energise different parts of the body and help to allow flow of prana throughout the system. According to Ayurveda, diseases are caused by lack or excess of any of the five elements – air, fire, water, earth and ether that causes imbalance in the body. The use of mudras directs the flow of energy in a way that balances the five elements and thus facilitates healing.\r\n \r\nIt is said that   a positive state of mind has a positive impact on your body. The root of an illness is in the mind.  Meditation is a powerful tool that helps in clearing your mind from negativity, anxiety, worry and other conflicts. When your mind is totally calm, alert and contented, it drives your body to perform better.  Which is why, in meditation healing happens. Meditation prevents stresses from entering your body system. When you meditate, you can silently use mantras to stay connected to the breath and the practice.\r\n \r\nThe Vedic Healing Mantra App has brought the best of mantra, mudra and meditation techniques that are neatly combined to give you desired health outcomes.

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

        "description": "Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is a type of inflammation in the nose which occurs when the immune systemoverreacts to allergens in the air. Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptom onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school. Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis. \r\nAllergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies attaching to the allergen and causing the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history in combination with a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These tests, however, are sometimes falsely positive. The symptoms of allergies resemble those of the common cold; however, they often last for more than two weeks and typically do not include a fever. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hay Fever Guide, Hay Fever Disease Management & Hay Fever Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hay Fever Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

Curious to find out how frequently you suffer from bowel conditions like constipation, diarrhea, or bloody stool? Well now tracking your bowel movements is easier than ever. \r\n\r\nFind out what consistency, color, frequency, and urgency means for your health by tracking and analyzing these stats over time, then use that data to determine if any issues, such as IBS, or crohn's are present.\r\n\r\nPoop Tracker uses the Bristol Stool Scale to determine the quality of your poop and allows you to track and analyze your bowel movement data across all of your log entries.\r\n\r\nPoop Tracker features include:\r\n\r\n- Easily and quickly log every poop you take.\r\n\r\n- Track poop stats like colour, Stool type (Bristol Stool Scale), urgency, size, bloody stool, pain, and custom notes. These metrics can be important to determine if you have any bowel problems such as diarrhea, constipation, ibs (irritable bowel syndrome), colitis, crohn's disease or any other chronic condition.\r\n\r\n- Log 'No Poop' days and leave custom notes when you're constipated.\r\n\r\n- View and modify previous poop log entries with our comprehensive calendar view of your stool history.\r\n\r\n- Export or Import a CSV data file of all of your stool entries so your data can be saved and restored, or sent to your healthcare provider.\r\n\r\n- View a data breakdown and graph of your stool statistics over time including metrics like when your bowel movements happen and a day by day history (premium feature).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy track your bowel movements?\r\n\r\nTracking bowel movements can be a useful tool to gauge your stool health over time and potentially uncover any chronic problems you might have such as: IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome), Crohn's disease, Colitis, Celiac disease, Chronic Diarrhea, or Constipation by noticing patterns and irregularities in your stool that you may not have noticed otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you already suffer from a chronic bowel condition, you can also benefit from maintaining a poop log as it allows you to monitor the severity of your symptoms and progression of these life altering diseases over time and share this data quickly and easily with your doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Bristol Stool Scale:\r\n\r\nThe Bristol stool scale, or BSF scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human stool into seven categories. It is used in both clinical and experimental fields. It is sometimes referred to in the UK as the Meyers scale. This is the scale used to track 'Type' in Poop Tracker because it is the most developed standard in many countries for categorizing feces.",

            "I like it. I was going to delete it to be honest. But when I started to look for a replacement I couldn't find one that was any better or even as good. I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

        "description": "In How Not to Die, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally-renowned nutrition expert, physician, and founder of NutritionFacts.org, examines the fifteen top causes of premature death in America--heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and more--and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches to help prevent and reverse these diseases, freeing us to live healthier lives.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The fifteen leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.\r\n\r\nHistory of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug-and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number 1 killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often stop it in its tracks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top fifteen causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen -a checklist of the twelve foods we should consume every day.Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

        "recentChanges": "Mutation 17 - The Fake News update<br>From wild conspiracy theories to election campaign mudslinging, we now live in a post-fact world where falsehoods and misinformation can spread just like a disease.<br>With help from professional fact checking organisations like &#39;Full Fact&#39; in the UK and &#39;Politifact&#39; in the USA - we&#39;ve designed a radically different scenario which lets you create your very own Fake News story and deceive the world with it.",
        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "I think the developers are bored with this game. They seem to just be spewing out rehashes of levels and the only updates appear to be efforts to wind back rewards and get as much money as they can out out of players before they cut and run. From a good game to one of the most boring in a few updates. Got a few months free play then zip, uninstall. Don't bother, money grubbers. Not worth it.",
            "I loved this game starting out but now that I'm in the 3000 plus levels I hardly win. The earthworm challenges are almost impossible to beat. Theres some fun little challenges but unless you can beat at least 10 levels you dont get the rewards. Be ready to spend a lot of money to buy gold to be able to beat levels. I've been playing since 2017 but I haven't hardly played in the last couple weeks. Probably gonna be uninstalling it very soon. Feels like more work than fun anymore",
            "This game has become unplayable without buying gold. I'm on level 3650. You can spend hours doing one level which is boring. If they added one move each time you failed a level it wouldn't be too bad, but you have to fail numerous times before a move gets added. The league tables are a joke as well , instead of being called the \"Championship of Great Britain\" it should be called the \"Championship of Who Can Afford the Most Gold\". I used to love this game to the point of obsession, not now tho'.",
            "It's a really fun, cute puzzler and the challenge is good. However I disagree with some of the micro transaction tactics. Constantly being left at the end of a level being 1 move short due to the RNG of the blocks dropping from the top where you need them to line up is very frustrating and you are tempted to buy extra moves with real money which I disagree with. The fiend styles are pretty cool though and are maybe worth buying to support the game. Not extra moves!",
            "OMG, you keep changing how the game scores making it harder to earn points. Stop changing how points are earned. After 3 years of playing, I'm about to quit. I play games for fun and pleasure, not to be fustrated by playing a level repeatedly that can't be skipped. I'm going on a long break from this game. Hopefully you make it fun again when I come back. Also, File size is getting too big."

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

Again, I enjoy this app but l'm just tired of looking for ways to answer clearly and that the questionaire with understand it more because of the problem. Thank you for this application",
            "This app is amazing. From the time that I had downloaded it , I cannot stop using it . It has provided me all the answers that I have ever searched (even maths with proper explanation) . You might not get ur answer some times so u can post a question and get an answer from other users. So you should definitely try this app. It will really help you alot🏆📖📚📑🎒",
            "The old version was very useful. But this one is not user friendly. Audio questions are only in hindi, if i ask in english it started to type in Hindi . And also the scan and solve option is also not working correctly, if i ask a question, it is diverting to other questions. The old version was very useful. I don't know what is happening in the new version.",
            "The app is awesome. The problem is with the latest version of android. There is a bug. Eveytime i work with formula tab, the app crashes. Also you can make improvements towards making inserting formulas much more easily and conveniently. The idea of app is good . I myself contributed answers. Please fix this issue as soon as possible in next update at earliest.",
            "This is a really great app! Ever since my modules came, I had trouble answering them. When I searched on Google for one of my questions, I found this app. I downloaded it and it is amazing!

            "I had AVG years ago. Had issues. Installed AVG Free a month ago. So impressed after a month, I bought the upgrade version. WOW! What a difference a clean machine makes! TY ! BobG in AZ",
            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Bunch of ads and a terrible energy system, which basically let's you start a one puzzle per day, unless you pay or watch even more ads (if there weren't enough already). One puzzle takes around 10 minutes to complete, so there you have it - play for 19 minutes, wait 24 hrs, play for 10 minutes again, wait another 24 hrs etc. Honestly you can find much better games out there and I hope you do. I'm not saying this particular game is bad, but its monetization is just terrible. ... Please fix.",
            "In my initial review, I talked about the long ads between each group. Since then there is a way to shorten the ad after only 3-5 seconds. So my update is to say that this is a really fun take on a crossword puzzle and the fact that the developers listened and worked out a solution gives the game a solid 5 stars. Thank you for responding and for working to find a solution!",
            "I have a Samsung Note9 but this game uses too much battery and makes my phone hot. I love, love, love this game so these facts make me sad. UPDATE: some of the ads (which I do not mind watching since they let me play for free, I can't afford to pay) but some of the ads are freezing the game. Please fix these issues. I do not want to delete. Have a blessed day",
            "I like this game, but there are too many ads. Each game takes 2 tokens and there aren't enough ways to gain tokens. It would be best to find ways to motivate people to play the game. Do fun games where they can win more tokens. Way too many ads!! Before you can play. After you play. Its crazy and a waste of time. Otherwise I really like this game and would probably keep playing of the ad situation can be made better.",
            "I love this game.Awsome,wonderful,amazing,superb😊😊😘😘😚.This might be the best game among all crossword games.There are even powerups to help if we are unable to find the word for a question.Very nice wonderful game.But the only thing is ,it works so slow if my data pack is over.I wish it to be work fast though my data pack is over .Hence i gave 4 stars. Apart from this ,it a awesome game .Loved it.🤗🤗"

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

        "description": "Skin Disease Treatments provides medical treatments info including rosacea. \r\nPeople say that beauty’s only skin deep; it’s what’s on the “inside” that counts. Our insides are certainly important, but skin treatment is your first layer of defense against the outside world. Skin can also give important clues to your overall health. Learn to take good care of your skin, so your skin can keep taking good care of you. \r\nSkin protects your body in many ways. The skin provides a barrier to protect the body from invasion by bacteria and other possible environmental hazards that can be dangerous for human health.\r\n\r\nSkin can also alert you to a health problem. A red, itchy rash might signal allergies or skin diseases, and a red “butterfly” rash on your face might be a sign of lupus. A yellow tint might indicate liver disease. And dark or unusual moles might be a warning sign of skin cancer. Be on the lookout for unexpected changes to your clear skin, and talk with your skin doctor if you have concerns.\r\n\r\nYour skin can become too dry if you don’t drink enough fluids or spend too much time in sunny or dry conditions. While washing hands is important for good hygiene, washing your hands too much can also lead to dry skin.\r\n\r\nThe sun can damage your skin as well. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light that causes sunburn and makes your skin age faster, leading to more wrinkles as you get older. There’s a strong link between UV exposure and skin cancer. So protect your skin from the sun. Wear hats and other protective clothing, use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and restrict your time in the sun during the late morning and early afternoon hours, when sunlight is strongest.\r\n\r\nMany skin researchers are studying the skin’s microbiome—the bacteria and other microscopic organisms that live on your skin. Some of these microbes can be helpful. Evidence suggests that they boost the body’s infection-fighting immune system and help keep you healthy. But there are some skin diseases with known associations with certain microbes. In the long run, scientists would like to find ways to support healthy skin microbes while reducing harmful ones.\r\n\r\nThe importance of keeping your skin healthy can't be overemphasized. It's the body's first defense against disease and morgellons, and it protects your internal organs from injuries. It is, in fact, the largest organ in the body. The skin helps regulate body temperature and prevents excess fluid loss, and it also helps your body remove excess water and salt.\r\n\r\nSkin conditions can affect anyone—young and old, men and women. Acne, hyperhidrosis and eczema are just a few examples of common skin disorders. The good news is that there are soap notes and a number of simple ways to keep skin healthy, and there also are now many options available to treat skin conditions, if treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer : If you think you may have a skin problem or need to learn how to better care for your skin, consultation with a dermatologist—a physician who specializes in treating the skin and keeping it healthy—may be in order. Don’t use this guide for main diagnose medical books. Skin problems can be difficult to diagnose because many skin conditions share similar symptoms. An evaluation is key to effective treatment.",

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not 😊); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a £iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

Until then, I can only give one star.",

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

Just as its supposed to be. instead of just playing a \"binaural beat\" where you hear the same tone in both ears. I would really love to have an option where u can finish your meditation with a soft bell sound instead of the bot saying \"congratz\" which catches me off guard. Highly recommend it. Am thinkjng about buying pro version! Keep it up guys!",

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

I have been using keep clean a lot, and it's changed, because now there's more ads than usual. Other than that keep clean is a great app, except for the inconvenience part of it, that's why I only gave four stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐❌",

Im dissapointed because it should keep your phone clean and safe but shows you adds for sketchy or dangerous websites like wish or dating apps. Kind of retorical if you ask me. I will update my review soon hopefully for the better.",

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

        "description": "Antioxidants are chemicals that interact with and neutralize free radicals, thus preventing them from causing damage. Antioxidants are also known as free radical scavengers.\r\n\r\nThe body makes some of the antioxidants it uses to neutralize free radicals. These antioxidants are called endogenous antioxidants. However, the body relies on external (exogenous) sources, primarily the diet, to obtain the rest of the antioxidants it needs. These exogenous antioxidants are commonly called dietary antioxidants. Fruits, vegetables, and grains are rich sources of dietary antioxidants. Some dietary antioxidants are also available as dietary supplements.\r\n\r\nExamples of dietary antioxidants include beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E (alpha-tocopherol). The mineral element selenium is often thought to be a dietary antioxidant, but the antioxidant effects of selenium are most likely due to the antioxidant activity of proteins that have this element as an essential component (i.e., selenium-containing proteins), and not to selenium itself.\r\n\r\nIn laboratory and animal studies, the presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development. Therefore, researchers have investigated whether taking dietary antioxidant supplements can help lower the risk of developing or dying from cancer in humans.\r\n\r\nMany observational studies, including case control studies and cohort studies, have been conducted to investigate whether the use of dietary antioxidant supplements is associated with reduced risks of cancer in humans. Overall, these studies have yielded mixed results (5). Because observational studies cannot adequately control for biases that might influence study outcomes, the results of any individual observational study must be viewed with caution.  \r\n\r\nRandomized controlled clinical trials, however, lack most of the biases that limit the reliability of observational studies. Therefore, randomized trials are considered to provide the strongest and most reliable evidence of the benefit and/or harm of a health-related intervention. To date, nine randomized controlled trials of dietary antioxidant supplements for cancer prevention  have been conducted worldwide. Many of the trials were sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. The results of these nine trials are summarized following.   \r\n\r\nAntioxidants are substances that can help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, or unstable molecules.

            "Good game BUT ads. 30 second ad to start a game. 30 second ad to finish a game. If you minimize this game to check texts or phone, another 30 second ad to resume. So a minimum of one minute in ads. I like the daily challenges but on this game I have not figured out what it takes to win a game. It appears that you have to complete a game about 30 times before it counts as completed. It is an good game if you have a lot of spare time and not much else to do."

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

After I borrowed a real level, it was easily 3 degrees off level, which is insane. Don't waste your time with this app. I used it without my case on an Pixel 4 Xl with location services turned on and the whole shebang. Avoid using.",
            "With a 10.3 inch tablet, it really shines. Anyone complaining about accuracy, maybe it's your phone/tablet's accuracy. Also, like a real level, the longer the baseline (length) the higher the accuracy.",

Stay full-time in a 36' travel trailer, and literally lay my phone on the counter and adjust the trailer to feel extremely level. GREAT APP, so far. I will probably upgrade if the price is fair.",

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

I know you can fix it by playing with wifi off, but what if i want to stream music while playing? For un online game I'll put up with short ads, as servers cost money to run, bust smashy road has NO online and thus NO SERVERS. this is outrageous.",
            "I play this game a lot, and it is really fun. But i have some suggestions for a future update. 1, the tanks are too fast, 2 the tanks reload speed is also too fast. 3 the car f1 needs something else, like a 5x faster cash, because it dosen't do anything but go fast. 4 please make it so that the cars don't slow down when they are in the grass. I also want to add a new car in the game, it would be a car that when u get arrested, you turn into a cop car and get 5 seconds to get away.",
            "I love this game i absolutley love it the chase speed cars etc is a lot of fun but theres 1 problem. When you get exploded by an oil truck sometimes you get thrown under the map which causes you to fail and i think that should be fixed but other then that 10/10 thank you.",
            "In my personal opinion smashy road wanted is in okay game however I have witnessed a few glitches during the gameplay your probably going to ask what glitches am I discussing about allow me to explain your driving on the road right? then suddenly you crash into a gasoline truck falling threw the map another thing when accidentally bump into one of the bigger police vehicles when you try to back up the car proceeds to go forward eventually you get arrested I do not recommend this game"

I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",
            "I am so furious! I subscribed for premium for a year and it worked for 3 days. I'm back to getting all the bloody annoying ads every few minutes. I hate it!! And the worst thing is there is no way to report it or contact them.",
            "Used to be great, but now the aggressive ads have killed it. I finish a puzzle in two minutes just to get hit with 2 back-to-back ads. I don't mind some advertising, but it's overkill now.",
            "The app was fine until they got all political. All the commercials have been for one party, like the are trying to jump on the main stream media ban wagon and shove the democratic party down everyone's throat. No thank you and I'm deleting the app. You can keep your one sided opinion."

I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

Symptoms may vary from mild to severe and usually begin six to thirty days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. Weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and headaches also commonly occur. Diarrhea is uncommon and vomiting is not usually severe. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases there may be confusion. Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months. Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected; however, they are still able to spread the disease to others. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with paratyphoid fever. The cause is the bacterium Salmonella typhi, also known as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, growing in the intestines and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include poor sanitation and poor hygiene. Those who travel to the developing world are also at risk and only humans can be infected. Diagnosis is by either culturing the bacteria or detecting the bacterium's DNA in the blood, stool, or bone marrow. Culturing the bacterium can be difficult. Bone marrow testing is the most accurate.

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "Hello I enjoy the app and feel it is one of the best out here. However, I would love to see the simple features of being able to: 1. Set the back ground image to an image of my own choosing like you can on Android phone's home screen or lock screen.  2. Allow you to like someone's text in a group chat.  3.  Allow you to add an remove ppl from group chats without having to create a new group.  Thanks",
            "Years after my last review, I still use this app daily. This really is the best messaging app out there. Still doesn't support sending videos, for some weird reason, but it's a solid app, backs up messages directly to the Android message store, allows you to customize the background, foreground, text bubbles, even the app icon. If you're one of those people whose default messenger doesn't let you send you send full-sized images, Textra is the only one I've found that lets me do this.",
            "Textra is the ONLY messenging app I will ever use! It's easy to use. You can customize EVERYTHING. Like the colors you use for every contact. You can set up Textra exactly how YOU want it to be. You can change the ring tones for every contact. There are 3 types of emojis you can use. I use IOS even though I have an Android phone. If you have an idea that you think might make Textra better, send them your idea and they may use it. If you need support-it's there. I love, love, love it!",
            "I have been using textra for years, always loved it, but here within the past day or so, chat heads are now popping up for new message notifications while I'm currently in the middle of messaging someone else. When you click to open the chat head it doesn't allow you to do anything, so you have to drag it to bottom to close it. Please how do I disable this feature, it's unpleasant and unwelcomed.",
            "When switching phones I ended up having trouble sending mms messages. When Textra support was contacted they were prompt in answering and emailed back and forth with me to try and fix the problem. Ultimately it was the cell providers/SIM card that was causing the issue. I have used the app for many years and on several different phones. I will continue to use this app and recommend it to everyone. Thank you for the help and a great app. Special thanx to Mandy and Max👍👍"

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

Then it hit me! Try updating the game..who knows? And lo and behold, it worked! So I am happily staying put, and keeping my favorite Word Search game!😃",
            "I live word searches so much and it's really calming to me aswell as stimulating my brain. I love this game in particular as it's not just words your finding, some of the rounds have words or patterns. It's really fun and give my brain a bit of a challenge. Love it, would reccomend",
            "Its mind boggling...is all I can say...i have been on it for just a few minutes and im so exhausted from all the thinking....I recommend it to anyone wishing to buid on their vocabulary....I didnt give it 5 stars because its so plain...atleast make it colourful developers otherwise keep it up",
            "Love this app!! Helps me relax at anytime of the day. Only drawback is when the tiny letter puzzles come up. Having arthritis in my hangs with finger tips that are messed up its hard to just tap on one row. At least a majority of the puzzles aren't this way.",
            "This is great, with a big exception: I want the game to mix up the words in my self-created word lists. I always include many more words than can be used in a single puzzle. Please don't always use just the initial words on my list. Mix 'em up! Yeah I could make a new word list each time, but that is cumbersome. Even better would be to scramble the words between each game."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "This is a very well designed app. It's clean, uncluttered, & easy to use. I downloaded it for the system tools, but it comes with an awesome wallpaper gallery where you can download them for free. It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5⭐) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5⭐! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",
            "I liked this app. I don't mind ads at all. I understand you game developers need a paycheck. But, they were making the app very hard to use. So, I and I image many others wrote feedback, and it is now fixed. Thank you for caring about us & fixinf the issue.",
            "Was wonderful for a while and then ads covering the screen. Scare tactics ads and others. I have never seen so many ads on an app. Makes it hard to use now.",
            "Seems to be doing a satisfactory amount of useful things. I don't rate 5 stars, nothing's perfect and I haven't had it but a short amount of time. So.... rates are rates. That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."

            "I enjoy word search games, regardless of level, obscurity of words, difficulty, simplicity, etc. My only negative about any game has more to do with appearance. There's something about this game that makes it uncomfortable to play for very long. Whether it's the size of the letters (almost too big) or the spacing, I don't know for sure. I had to use the dark screen option and that helped a little. Also, once many words are found, the letters become obscured by the pastel \"mark off\" stripes.",
            "What's not to love about this app?? The ads stay on top of screen (no annoying video that pops up), easy settings, a great mix of words, simple design, and extremely easy to use. The only thing I would say is that I wish the \"dark setting\" would make the whole screen black. However, that's not enough for me to make it lose a star. It's nice having a simple crossword puzzle that's easy on the eyes. Definitely recommend 👍",
            "I like it, but they repeat the same words. Maybe have a theme for each puzzle, and the words pertain to the puzzle....",
            "The best thing about this app is that they don't have pop up ads they always stay at the top. It's very easy and simple for all ages to play! 5 stars from me!",
            "The best word search app. I used to play this game like 8 years ago on my first smartphone. I was looking for this app specifically but tried others and this one is still the best. It's just so straightforward and smooth and challenging. Perfection."

I like the math, and memory mode very much I love this game , This much good game they are giving in 3 mb so all can download it . Bye 😎",

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

Someone hack my account that i spent goo few ££ on it and totally destroyed. I've got in touch with customer service straight after someone logged in from different device and asked for help so they block them, unfortunately they reply 3days later when everything was destroyed and told me \"sorry comma,we can't help you\"",

            "Its hard to play game specially REFT of LEGEND, the events unbalance the player during matching. Other events is good, the concern is adjast the research time of all research so that weak can balance to the strongeist and so for the player spend money to become strong.",

            "I transferred the entire contents of a uSD card to a larger capacity card using Memory Zone. Two things: 1. The file list should scroll as files are copied/moved so you can see where you are in the process. 2. Much more importantly, the timestamps on the copied/moved files *should be the same as the original files*. Having 200 gb of files with the current date and time is useless. I will now have to do the entire thing again using a different utility. The app is useless until this is corrected.",
            "My first attempt to copy a video worked, so went ahead and moved a bunch of pics using this app. All files are on the USB but are unable to open on any device stating \"unsupported file type\" and I can't find how to fix so my pics are lost. Awful experience, I'll be seeking a refund 👎👎👎",
            "I would not recommend this app at this time, because I can't use it. I have to: grant the SD card (which is SanDisk card) access to the SanDisk Memory Zone app in order to complete the operation. The directions that come with the app are incomplete at best. So far using this app has been a waste of time. I can't transfer anything at this point. I've tried contacting you once before & I'm still waiting for an answer or acknowledgment. The SD card I have on my phone now is the SanDisk Ultra Plus microSDXC UHS-I card with Adapter 64GB. The small card is the one I can use on my phone.",
            "I loooove the App.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't get my songs to play one after the other. If you could make that happen I would give 10 stars. Apart from that I love the App. Soooo glad I can edit and rename and move my music back and forth from folder to folder.",
            "One of the Best App in entire playstore. This app is extremely useful for your personal data Handling , Avoids Google drive file duplications shows your internal and external storages and also your cloud storages with proper details. Can move or copy data from one location to another very easily."

            "Push notifications declaring I have matches and should start conversation only to get in and there's nothing. Either don't do the push notifications like that until they've been there a little, or if it's bugging, fix it; I don't mind if someone unmatches but I'd rather know that's why they're not showing up so I'm not left thinking the app is sabotaging it? Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",
            "Totally miserable experience. Repetitive match suggestions, they keep appearing even after I reject them. Overpriced super expensive extras. All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",
            "Ive been on tinder acouple of times in the past and it was easy without and real problem or bug. I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

I always get new awards. However, there are so many adds. Which I do not like. I absolutely hate it. Although, all the adds do remove but you have to pay money. It was a fantastic app. I really love the app. I would be shock if anyone rated this a one star. I just cannot believe that.💙💙💙😀",
            "Really good, I was having problems with a other paint by number and it got a little boring so I decided to get this one. This never gets boring for me and has so many puzzles. I also like how it is divided in different genres, it makes it easier to find what I want to do and find specific things that may be hard to see. There is just one problem: I allowed my camera and It still won't let me make custom art, very sad but it's only one problem which I can get from other pixel art apps so it's ok.",
            "Honestly, this game has to be one of my favorite apps in my phone! It just makes me feel so creative and happy. When I'm a little bit sad or maybe just bored, I play this game and it just makes me feel so happy! Also, just to point out, when the other pictures, like, is kinda special, you can just watch an ad and its free! Well, despite the other option which is to get the premium, its fine! So, I am highly reccomending this game to kids, teens, adults, every age!",
            "I absolutely love this game. There are many kinds of drawings to color . I love that the game has different categories to chose from. If you want to color a special drawing it takes 1 add to get it, Well for me it does. I color at least 15 drawings a day. This game is a calming game and a relaxing game. This game is a great game to play in quarantine too. THE END",
            "I love this game, dont get me wrong. Though there is this issue that happens quite a lot when I'm coloring in pictures. I'll be filling/coloring in a picture of something and then there will be a color missing. And I cant find it even when I click the bulb to find it it cant, and then I cant finish the coloring page. Hope you can fix that. 😐"

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."
