            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",
            "I started using this app because I know I will need a lengthy history to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I like how easy this app is to use and record my daily symptoms and over all how Im feeling. This app is super helpful.",
            "Love this. Most apps that track your activities etc are very limited without subscribing but this one has a lot of free features and is a great way of keeping track of patterns"

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",
            "The UI experience is bad and not intuitive. I found it frustrating to use."

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",
            "Paid premium, and didn't recieve. Sending questions and suggestions via email, and Facebook. No answer because they are closed on weekends. This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",

Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

I wanted to relate this to triggers causing pain and also to actions/Meds to reduce pain. This app did not seem to do that or had such a lack of intuitive design that it was all but useless.

By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences.\r\n\r\nThe system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is designed to be especially energy-efficient, and it doesn’t collect any geolocation data, including GPS data. The app does not (and cannot) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address.

In addition, this code changes several times every hour, protecting user privacy even more.\r\n• The data saved on the smartphone is encrypted.\r\n• The connections between the app and the server are encrypted.\r\n• All data, whether stored on the device or on the server, is deleted when no longer relevant, and certainly no later than December 31, 2020.\r\n• The Ministry of Health is the body that collects the data and decides for which purposes to use it.

            "Easy to use app. It works similarly to the Corona APP used in Germany. The only reason why I don't give five stars, is that the Apps should be interconnected across borders, to allow information to flow across borders.",
            "I can't see the point of using this app when it's got less than 3million downloads in a country of 60million plus tourists and if its the tourists who are bringing it in from countries that aren't being tested on entry it renders it useless... Also drains battery more than it states!!",
            "the app is almost invisible on your phone, it doesn't drain battery at all. Ignore the people leaving 1 star because it's pointless unless a lot of people download it, like wow sherlock holmes really?? maybe you should blame people instead of blaming an app lol",
            "I would love to give 5 star as its very useful to know if Iam expose to someone who has been infected by covid. But if I use this all day when Im out. With the bluetooth and location open drains my battery life. Too many notification too."

Once a person is undetectable it is not possible to pas the virus through unprotected sex... (blood to blood is possible) however if hiv+ person contracts another illness or doesn't take the treatment it is possible that vital load can peak and once again be detectable for a period of time. You should be fully informed.",

In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to perform their functions. In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.\r\n\r\nPathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms,[1] including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.\r\n\r\nDisorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer.[2] Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

        "description": "La Sociedad Española de Reumatología (SER) y la Sociedad Española de Medicina de Familia y Comunitaria (SEMFYC) han desarrollado conjuntamente una guía sobre las  enfermedades autoinmunes sistémicas para facilitar la derivación al reumatólogo por parte del médico de atención primaria, con el objetivo de  detectar y remitir las posibles sospechas de este tipo de afecciones.\r\n\r\nEsta iniciativa está coordinada por la Dra. Ana Urruticoechea Arana, reumatóloga; y por el Dr. Fernando León Vázquez, médico de familia. Y en el comité editorial participan los doctores Iñigo Rúa-Figueroa, José Luis Andréu, Alejandro Olivé,  Mercedes Freire y Vicente Giner.\r\n\r\nEl objetivo principal del proyecto es desarrollar una guía de derivación que ayudará al médico de atención primaria en la toma de decisiones ante la sospecha clínica de una EAS, facilitando su reconocimiento y su derivación al reumatólogo en su caso.\r\n\r\nEl objetivos secundario es sensibilizar a los médicos de familia de la existencia de estas patologías menos frecuentes, mejorar la calidad de las derivaciones, disminuir los tiempos de espera y coordinar los dos niveles asistenciales en relación con estas patologías.\r\n\r\nPor su complejidad, la afectación multi-sistémica y baja frecuencia, el manejo de las enfermedades autoinmunes sistémicas es un formidable reto al que se enfrenta el médico en su práctica clínica. Su abordaje requiere aprendizaje específico durante el periodo formativo, experiencia y una puesta al día constante. Aunque estas patologías se consideran enfermedades poco frecuentes, en conjunto se pueden considerar no excepcionales. “De hecho, estas enfermedades afectan a cientos de miles de pacientes en España y el médico de atención primaria puede enfrentarse durante su ejercicio a múltiples casos, al menos, al inicio de la enfermedad y colaborar con los especialistas en su seguimiento. En este sentido, deberá por tanto aprender a reconocerlas y mejorar sus competencias básicas en el manejo de este grupo de procesos”\r\n\r\nRealizado por un grupo de expertos de las dos sociedades científicas: Sociedad Española de Medicina Familiar y Comunitaria (SEMFYC) y Sociedad Española de Reumatología (SER). Se ha diseñado un índice de síntomas y signos guía a partir de cada uno de los cuáles se ha desarrollado consensuadamente un algoritmo de toma de decisiones que conducen a una lista de posibles diagnósticos y una propuesta de derivación. Los panelistas  han seleccionado diferentes signos y síntomas sospechosos de EAS. Cada algoritmo lo ha realizado una pareja formada por un especialista de reumatología y otro de medicina familiar y comunitaria, pertenecientes a la SER y SEMFYC, respectivamente. \r\n\r\nSe han diseñado 22 algoritmos homogeneizados con síntomas y síndromes ordenados por órganos y aparatos:\r\n\r\n- Cutáneos: Exantema, fotosensibilidad, púrpura, eritema nodoso y livedo reticularis.\r\n\r\n- Mucosos: Aftas orales y genitales, sinusitis crónica, xerostomía y parotidomegalia.\r\n\r\n- Vasculares: Fenómeno de Raynaud, trombosis venosa recurrente e isquemia arterial.\r\n\r\n- Oculares: Uveítis, ojo seco y epiescleritis.\r\n\r\n- Neurológicos: Cefalea/arteritis de la temporal.\r\n\r\n- Abortos recurrentes.\r\n\r\n- Músculoesqueléticos: Artritis agudas, artritis crónicas, artromialgias y dolor crónico.\r\n\r\n- Síntomas generales: Pérdida de peso y fiebre.\r\n\r\n- Alteraciones analíticas: Reactantes de fase (VSG y PCR),  factor reumatoide, ANAs y la creatinfosfokinasa.\r\n\r\nLes presentamos la GUÍA DE DERIVACIÓN que se ha  desarrollado en una aplicación (App) que facilita su disponibilidad en un formato actual. El contenido llevado a cabo se actualizará según la evidencia presentada. También se editará en PDF y se valorará la posibilidad de realizarla en formato impreso.",

One form of the condition, known as CREST syndrome, classically results in calcium deposits, Raynaud's syndrome, esophageal problems, thickening of the skin of the fingers and toes, and areas of small dilated blood vessels.

            "I love how you can type in a sickness or cold or sore leg muscles & it will bring up a bunch of different remedies to try. A very easy & clear app love it 💕",
            "This is an amazing app. It literally tells u all kinds of home made natural remedies and recipes u can use or make to use. For me, I've been having trouble with acne and it gave me a huge list with good detailing on what I need, and how to use it, and how to make it. It's not just for acne though. Upset stomach, in general just wanting to b healthy. It's a great app. At least for me it is. It's worth it to check out if ur into stuff like this",
            "The site is amazing from A to Z and then some. It goes far beyond my expectations, especially considering it's free! It's a plethora of information ! Not to mention the advertisements are minimal and not intrusive ! 100% recommend this app"

        "description": "Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure. The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There are a number of subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.",

I just wish it gave more category of options of health issues at the very beginning to better pin point what is wrong so I can get the correct treatment for my symptoms.",

A beginner student could have made this app. It displays at least 3 ads before you get to your \"diagnosis\" (which was far from correct, by the way.) They claim it's artificial intelligence and that they got help from doctors, but honestly, it looks like they just googled \"common diseases\" and \"how to make an app\" and combined the search results.

It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.",

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

Normally our immune systems produce proteins called \"antibodies\" which protect the body from these invaders.\r\n\r\n\"Autoimmunity\" means your immune system cannot tell the difference between these foreign invaders and your body’s healthy tissues (\"auto\" means \"self\"). As a result, it creates autoantibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue.\r\n\r\nThese autoantibodies cause inflammation, pain, and damage in various parts of the body.\r\n\r\nthere are also various ways to cure diseases:\r\n• How To Cure Wheezing\r\n• How To Cure Anxiety\r\n• How To Cure Acne\r\n• How To Cure Asthma\r\n• How To Cure Autism\r\n• How To Cure Allergies\r\n• How To Cure Backpain\r\n• How To Cure Bleeding\r\n• How To Cure Bloating\r\n• How To Cure Cancer\r\n• How To Cure Cough\r\n• How To Cure Constipation\r\n• How To Cure Cold\r\n• How To Cure Chapped Lips\r\n• How To Cure Cramps\r\n• How To Cure Chicken Pox\r\n• How To Cure Depression\r\n• How To Cure Diarrhea\r\n• How To Cure Diabetes\r\n• How To Cure Dizziness\r\n• and others\r\n\r\nThis application is free.

The diseases that lead to cirrhosis do so because they injure and kill liver cells, after which the inflammation and repair that is associated with the dying liver cells causes scar tissue to form. The liver cells that do not die multiply in an attempt to replace the cells that have died. This results in clusters of newly formed liver cells (regenerative nodules) within the scar tissue. There are many causes of cirrhosis including chemicals (such as alcohol, fat, and certain medications), viruses, toxic metals (such as iron and copper that accumulate in the liver as a result of genetic diseases), and autoimmune liver disease in which the body's immune system attacks the liver.\r\nCirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism.",

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

A very balanced and clean app , I m loving it !!",

            "The app is very informative in terms of the food options, recipe, calorific intake etc. The think that I love most about the app is that it has these notes that tell you, how to can reuse some ingredients or if you like sweeter things, how you could do that wish your dish in a healthier way.

        "description": "Arthritis pain: Arthritis is a group of painful and degenerative conditions marked by inflammation in the joints that causes stiffness and pain. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, gets worse with age and is caused by wear and tear over the years. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints as if they were foreign tissues. Because of this, rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease.\r\n\r\nDoctors traditionally treat arthritis with anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers. However, some medications cause side effects, and a natural approach to pain relief is becoming more popular. Remember to consult your doctor before trying these natural remedies.\r\n\r\n1. Lose weight\r\nYour weight can make a big impact on the amount of pain you experience from arthritis. Extra weight puts more pressure on your joints — especially your knees, hips, and feet.\r\n\r\nReducing the stress on your joints by losing weight will improve your mobility, decrease pain, and prevent future damage to your joints.\r\n\r\n2. Get more exercise\r\nThere are more benefits to exercise than just weight loss. Regular movement helps to maintain flexibility in your joints. Weight-bearing exercises such as running and walking can be damaging. Instead, try low-impact exercises such as water aerobics or swimming to flex your joints without adding further stress.\r\n\r\n3. Use hot and cold therapy\r\nSimple hot and cold treatments can make a world of difference when it comes to arthritis pain. Long, warm showers or baths — especially in the morning — help ease stiffness in your joints. Use an electric blanket or moist heating pad at night to keep your joints loose.\r\n\r\nCold treatments are best for relieving joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Wrap a gel ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables in a towel and apply it to painful joints for quick relief.\r\n\r\n4. Try acupuncture\r\nAcupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. This is supposed to reroute energies and restore balance in your body. Acupuncture is the most researched complementary therapy and is recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of over 100 different conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that acupuncture has the ability to reduce arthritis pain. If you want to explore this treatment method, be sure to find a licensed and certified acupuncturist in your state.\r\n\r\n5. Use meditation to cope with pain\r\nMeditation and relaxation techniques may be able to help you reduce pain from arthritis by reducing stress and enabling you to cope with it better. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have found that the practice of mindfulness meditation is helpful for some people with painful joints. Researchers also found that those with depression and arthritis benefitted the most from meditation. When stress is reduced, inflammation and thus swelling and pain drop.\r\n\r\nArthritis Guide Main Features: \r\n\r\n✅ arthritis ✅\r\n✅ rheumatoid arthritis ✅\r\n✅ arthritis in hands ✅\r\n✅ arthritis pain relief ✅",

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain. Any organ, however, can be affected. The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved. Often there are no, or only mild, symptoms. When it affects the lungs there may be wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Some may have Löfgren syndrome in which there is fever, large lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed. Those with affected family members are at greater risk.  Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms, which may be supported by biopsy. Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides, high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level, or elevated levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the blood. The diagnosis should only be made after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "Works great. Takes a bit of time to learn to navigate the app. Surprised at the number of vegan recipes available. Some food were incorrectly inputted so I sent a report and also updated what I have. I wish you could update the info yourself. Also, I wish there was more flexibility with the intermitten fasting time. Overall, happy and hopeful it will help me achieve my weight loss goal.",
            "I've been using this app for quite a few years and it is pretty decent. However, I was quite disappointed that the search option for one's own foods was removed; now one has to scroll endlessly until they find the food they are looking for. Furthermore, I would suggest adding a meal prep feature where one inputs the nutrition details for what one eats, but then the actual calories and stuff is only added to the daily counter once it has been eaten(a check off system).",
            "I really love how many options of food there are, I can always find the exact thing I've eaten on here and how much I had. The only thing I don't really like is the feature connecting the app with a step counter app like Google fit, it doesn't really seem to work properly and update my steps so I've started just adding them in manually. Aside from that it does all I need.",
            "When you search food it doesn't have as many options as I would like, such as restaurants. It might have one calorie count for something and the one below it is completely different. It's hard to know what's right or wrong. You can add them in but I don't want to do that every time so I feel like I am guessing. I wish it would have things set as peice or amount. It reminds you frequently to log info and encourages you which I like, and has a lot of meal options. The meal calorie count is nice.",
            "I'm using it to track my dietary supplements, it's pretty straight forward, and you can add your own foods (like your mom's recipe and stuff). I wish I could be more precise with the measurements (Adding Vitamin D in milligrams is pretty useless, for example) and that it accepted more nutrients (my supplement has a ton of vitamins and minerals, and it would be nice to track those. I wish I knew an app that could approximately the micronutrients content of my mom's recipe too...)"

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",
            "I think it's a great game you should download it it really help me right now I've finished day one and the wrist workout oh I help me alot cuz my right wrist use to make the crack sound when I spin it and now it totally fine. I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

        "description": "We have created a groundbreaking and scientifically supported cookbook for those with Hashimoto’s (autoimmune hypothyroidism). It’s masterfully written and will support you for a lifetime of peak thyroid health no matter where you currently are on your wellness journey.\r\n\r\nThis long-awaited volume is a book within a cookbook – it contains a substantive educational component as well as over 100 original ''food as medicine'' recipes that not only satisfy and delight your taste buds, but also provide you with maximum nourishment for your thyroid and immune system and help you translate simple, thyroid- and immune-supportive nutrition to your plate. \r\n\r\nFor anyone who has wanted to cook confidently for optimal thyroid and immune function, this is your definitive guide. Be prepared for more unfussy, artfully crafted, mouthwatering recipes and well-studied, reliable, non-dogmatic thyroid- and immune-supportive nutrition information than you’ve ever seen in one cookbook. \r\n\r\nHashimoto's is the most common autoimmune disease and thyroid problems are among the most prevalent yet overlooked conditions that compromise women's wellbeing. (Additionally, men are being diagnosed in increasing numbers.) With their combined 20 years of nutrition and culinary wisdom, the authors have a mission to help those with Hashimoto’s reclaim their health. \r\n\r\nWe took a rigorous academic approach to this cookbook. In preparation for the choices of ingredients, we created a “nutritional springboard” that’s the foundation for their recipes.

        "descriptionHTML": "We have created a groundbreaking and scientifically supported cookbook for those with Hashimoto’s (autoimmune hypothyroidism). It’s masterfully written and will support you for a lifetime of peak thyroid health no matter where you currently are on your wellness journey.<br><br>This long-awaited volume is a book within a cookbook – it contains a substantive educational component as well as over 100 original &#39;&#39;food as medicine&#39;&#39; recipes that not only satisfy and delight your taste buds, but also provide you with maximum nourishment for your thyroid and immune system and help you translate simple, thyroid- and immune-supportive nutrition to your plate. <br><br>For anyone who has wanted to cook confidently for optimal thyroid and immune function, this is your definitive guide. Be prepared for more unfussy, artfully crafted, mouthwatering recipes and well-studied, reliable, non-dogmatic thyroid- and immune-supportive nutrition information than you’ve ever seen in one cookbook. <br><br>Hashimoto&#39;s is the most common autoimmune disease and thyroid problems are among the most prevalent yet overlooked conditions that compromise women&#39;s wellbeing. (Additionally, men are being diagnosed in increasing numbers.) With their combined 20 years of nutrition and culinary wisdom, the authors have a mission to help those with Hashimoto’s reclaim their health. <br><br>We took a rigorous academic approach to this cookbook. In preparation for the choices of ingredients, we created a “nutritional springboard” that’s the foundation for their recipes. They extensively researched the most supportive nutrients for the thyroid and immune system and then identified foods that are dense sources of these nutrients, which ultimately laid the groundwork for the cookbook.<br><br>Additionally, the recipes: <br><br>- Emphasize nutrient-dense, whole food ingredients full of color and flavor<br>- Are gluten-free, dairy-free, and free of refined sugars and other highly processed ingredients<br>- Are targeted to the home cook and easy to prepare; many can be made in 30 minutes or less<br>- Are thoughtfully created to appeal to all palates<br>- Contain sensible adaptations, whenever possible, to fit dietary practices commonly used to address thyroid imbalances and autoimmunity, such as Paleo and Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) <br><br>In this cookbook, you&#39;ll also discover well-researched and practical education about: <br><br>- Root causes of Hashimoto&#39;s and hypothyroidism<br>- Key nutrients known to boost thyroid and immune function and their food sources <br>- The connection between digestive health and thyroid imbalances<br>- Nutrition and lifestyle strategies for taming autoimmunity<br>- A discussion on &#39;&#39;goitrogenic&#39;&#39; foods, soy, and the dangers of &#39;&#39;low carb&#39;&#39; for those with hypothyroidism<br>- How to determine if certain foods may be triggering inflammation and autoimmunity <br>- Much, much more<br><br>This quintessential cookbook is a tour de force – a work of art and a work of science.

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough. In immunocompromised individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water; recent evidence suggests that it can also be transmitted via fomites in respiratory secretions. Cryptosporidium is the organism most commonly isolated in HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea.[medical citation needed] Despite not being identified until 1976, it is one of the most common waterborne diseases and is found worldwide. The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy microbial cysts (oocysts) that, once ingested, sporozoites within oocysts excyst (i.e., are released) and result in an infection of intestinal epithelial tissue.",

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Another update and I still can't get to expert picture settings. Now I get an error that says to restart the TV. I do this and still same error. Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

At last I want to tell you this app is very nice please download it and do exercise at home regularly and stay fit. I also thank all those who make this app. This app is very helpful. Once again Thankyou all 🙏🙏😉😉",
            "I absolutely love it! First of all, you don't have to pay for keeping your body healthy like most off the other apps(I got no money). Second of all, it gives you a food planning thing which is really healthy for our body. Third of all, it keeps track of your everyday workouts and your weight. I just really like this app, definitely should get it if you want to lose weight. 😊",
            "It's a great simple app to remind myself to do a little exercise every day. The workouts may seem easy to some, but I find they work muscles that are easily missed during typical weight lifting workouts. With a little know how, it'ss easy to modify the exercises to increase or decrease difficulty. Most of the moves can be performed with very little noise or jumping around. It gets a little monotonous after a few weeks.",
            "Very very very goood app. I live it. I has really worked on me. The coach this app. She is really very good. She gives us tip and directions of the exercise very well. She even mentions where to the exercise like in bed and stuff. I recommend it to every one who wishes ti get fit and loose weight. I swear it really works or effects on u. And the diet plan no words. I really appreciate it and thank u. Keep going.",
            "OMG ! This app is wonderful. First of all we can lose our weight without money. I could loss my weight easily with the instructions voice coach had told. If you follow the exercises correctly you can also find the changes. I will give this app 5 star because of the changes I found while I did the exercises. Thank you very much for Making this app wonderful."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "It's a brilliant app, especially for gachatubers like me. I kinda wish the way you could tween was easier, and looked more realistic. I'm not trying to be rude, I love the app! But cute cut is to complicated for me and many others. So, i tried kinemaster, yeah it works but it doesn't look that realistic. This doesn't have to mean hate to the company! Have a great day whoever is reading!",
            "I am a premium subscriber. I've used this app since November last year or so. It was amazing! It had everything I ever needed to make videos. But as soon as I became a premium suscriber, all the quality went down. Now, everything looks pixelated and fuzzy. It also sometimes lags and kicks me out nonstop. I'll go onto kinemaster and my screen freezes and eits me out saying 'Kinemaster isn't responding' I'll be waiting for this to be fixed. Right now I'm on a different app for videos.",
            "this app is exquisite! once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to edit with! an amazing thing about this is that it's on android and ios. But the downside of this app is whenever i export a video and put it on high quaility, the video actually looks like it has bad quaility! i also wish that a you could get rid of the watermark for free, but it's fine! overall, i think this app works amazing! totally reccommend!",
            "This app used to be awesome. Now it is so slow. Especially when you are checking through the music or sfx library. It takes times to load. Tsk tsk... not a value for my subscription anymore. Not gonna renew this anymore until I see a fix. Additonal review: I'm surprised that no one got back to me on this after the 1 star rating. Anyway, my annual sunscription is about to finish and already looking for a better one and I can see one worth trying though.",
            "I've been using Kinemaster for approx 2 months, makin videos for my gaming YouTube Channel. I do it all on my phone and the response has been just incredible. I can extract audio and overlay it enablin voice over clip commentary, I add effects, transitions and overlay not just pictures but also VIDEOS, yes, SCREENCAPTURES off my phone, crop such videos not just in length but also a specific area of the video I want to show, and all round every thing i could want to make memes and vids. 10/10!🔥"

            "This is a great app the only complaint is you can't make your own pin and play with other friends cuz when you type student it won't let me lion and when I try to enter the pin like I make a pin and it just won't let me play it because they did some research the PIN well the rest of the game is fun but I am I always need to get another device so so I can play in the rest of the game is pretty fun that's why I'm giving you five stars your games are pretty good keep up the good work I play this .",

Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟 Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

With the personal details that will be available on the emergency contacts card including medical conditions, blood group, emergency contact number, etc, you will be able to receive the assistance that you may need in an emergency situation. Besides this basic information, you also have the option to add additional information such as allergies, medicine, and disease.\r\n\r\nWith ICE App, the first time responders will easily have access to all the information they will need to provide you with medical emergency help and also to call your loved ones. The app also includes a ‘secret’ section which will be encrypted with a passcode so that only a loved one who has the passcode may have access to the information inside it. The screen will display a message directing the responders to contact the person with the passcode. Other details like your vaccine history, physician contact and insurance may also be stored in the app and may come in handy when receiving medical emergency help.   \r\n\r\n\r\nHow will responders access the information?\r\nThe responders will be redirected to the emergency medical ID or information stored in the app when they tap the notification bar on the lock screen of your phone.  \r\n\r\nHow to show Notification/Floating icon over locked screen?\r\nUnder More tab, you will see Notification / Lock Screen feature and clicking on that you can enable or disable the each feature from lock screen.

You will just need to pay USD $8 to receive access to unlimited features on the ICE - In Case of Emergency.\r\n\r\nWhat does the premium version offer?\r\nAmong the unlimited features that you have access to with the premium version of ICE Emergency app, here are the most notable ones:\r\n●\tYou can store a 30-second voice recording which will appear on the profile page. This feature will be an additional asset if you were in need of medical emergency help.\r\n●\tBy clicking on the ‘App lock’ option, you can enable or disable the app lock.

Free app is still useful even without full features, I recommend this and having worked in the ambulance service I wish people would use or have this on their phones more often, saving time is saving lives, this app could one day do just that. Developer is also friendly, helpful and punctual with responding to questions or help.",

If you have only one medication or allergy & no emergency contacts...this is the app for you. However, if you live in the real world...pass this one by. Looking for the app I had on my old phone ..unlimited entrees & 100% free.",

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

        "description": "Narcolepsy is a long-term neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Symptoms include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. These spells can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly there may be inability to move or vivid hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up. People with narcolepsy tend to sleep about the same number of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be worse. The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown with potentially several causes. In up to 10% of cases there is a family history of the disorder. Often those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. Trauma, infections, toxins, or psychological stress may also play a role. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol, and not getting enough sleep. Cataplexy may be mistaken for seizures.",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "This app is very productive and it has helped me maintain my drinking of water, it is a great app!!😘 I just feel like it could atleast notify me with a sound when the time to drink arrives because we are busy human beings atleast a beep sound will make me stop what I am doing and remember I have to drink water, besides that it's a good app and thanks for reminding me the importance of drinking water you deserve 5 stars because I feel hydrated👌",
            "It really works. It keeps me constant and I don't fall off of drinking my 8 cups of water a day. My skin has also started clearing up on my face and I have a much better immune system now. Lots of pros if you buy this app. I haven't had any issues that needed resolving. I would recommend!😁",
            "Excellent app, does exactly what it's set out to do and does wonders for your water drinking habits. I had to remove 1 star however, as it doesn't have any vibration notification options and sometimes presents a delay when you record a drink. Ps. There's a small grammatical error in the main menu ('you've stay hydrated).",
            "This app it a really good reminder of I must take my water in 500ml that's what I chose even when I wake up, I think of taking my water I love it's reminder that I must drink water . It's really nice I cannot delete this app. It has made me kept me motivated all time long .",
            "Nice app, would rather have a push notification at tge right time rather than a constant message on the notification bar, as if I don't check my phone I might miss it. Also, if I reach the goal I do not want to see notification anymore, while even when selecting that option, I do. But overall, good to use."

The pain may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse with lying down or breathing deep. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual. The cause of pericarditis is believed to be most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, uremic pericarditis, following a heart attack, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chest trauma. The cause often remains unknown. Diagnosis is based on the chest pain, a pericardial rub, specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and fluid around the heart.

Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",
            "I rarely get notifications of a new message. Messages are left on \"S\" despite having perfect cullar and wifi connection on both ends. Kin market no longer updates. Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",
            "Good if you know what your looking for in an existing group chat or want too make your own. The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",
            "What's up with this chat limit thing? I tried to delete the cache, i stoped the app several times. I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",
            "This app is not what it used to be. The sheer amount of bots have really ruined the experience. Remove one and 2 or 3 more flood in right behind them. I report each and every one of them but I suspect nothing is really being done about it, which is a shame because this used to be my favourite app."

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

About four days after download I'm on level 10 and can feel myself losing interest -- app will probably be deleted within a few days.",

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "Ads Ads Ads Ads Ads Ads Ads and more ADS!!! I purchased the option to remove triggered ads.. and guess what? There are more ads! Toys break and require you to purchase coins to fix them. There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",
            "I LOVE IT! omg i love the mini games, i'll say, THIS IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! so many things that you can do omg i love everything in this game! specially the events, even the ads bothering me, it's okay. thank you outfit7! i'm looking forward for the future updates! (more activities and games please! thank you so much) 😻🤍",
            "Ok, this game is interesting, BUT! I have some few complains........ When tom grows, he isn't cute at all! And when his emoji level is down, he simply gets angry at me at a certain age. When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

Hope this is figured out soon, cause now my streaks are gone 😒 Uhh I reinstalled the app cause I needed to make room for something else at the moment, and I'm trying to get it back on my phone, and it's telling me my device is not supported??? (This was all on the same day btw). It's not like I even had a choice in whether or not to update my phone cause nothing would work without the update.",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 or 4 years now and I've never had any problems until now. I renewed my Amino+ membership and it wouldn't update or let me open the shop. I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",
            "Everytime I try to put a YouTube video on my post, or when I do a live video screening, the link is always saying that it's \"invalid.\" I've been having this problem for months and when I try getting in contact with customer service, they just send me a link to an help center which doesn't help in the slightest!

        "description": "Haemophilia, also spelled hemophilia, is a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding. This results in people bleeding longer after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain. Those with a mild case of the disease may have symptoms only after an accident or during surgery. Bleeding into a joint can result in permanent damage while bleeding in the brain can result in long term headaches, seizures, or a decreased level of consciousness. There are two main types of haemophilia: haemophilia A, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor VIII, and haemophilia B, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor IX. They are typically inherited from one's parents through an X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene.[6] Rarely a new mutation may occur during early development or haemophilia may develop later in life due to antibodies forming against a clotting factor. Other types include haemophilia C, which occurs due to not enough factor XI, and parahaemophilia, which occurs due to not enough factor V. Acquired haemophilia is associated with cancers, autoimmune disorders, and pregnancy. Diagnosis is by testing the blood for its ability to clot and its levels of clotting factors.",

Możesz w nim zapisywać co zjadłeś i jak się czułeś po posiłku, jak również dodać zdjęcie zarówno posiłku spoza jadłospisu jak i posiłek z dedykowanego jadłospisu w wybranym przez Ciebie programie żywieniowym. Jednym kliknięciem automatycznie zapiszesz posiłek z jadłospisu w dzienniczku. \r\n\r\nMożesz zapisać również sen, czas jego trwania i jakość snu, trening, jego czas, intensywność i samopoczucie, jeśli korzystasz z timera treningowego, po zakończeniu treningu jednym kliknięciem zapiszesz go w swoim dzienniczku, wypróżnienia i problemy z tym związane, możesz również dodać swoje selfie żeby dokumentować np. stan swojej skóry czy sylwetkę w trakcie diety. \r\n\r\nW dzienniczku zapisuj również przyjemności, które sobie sprawiasz w ciągu dnia, nie tylko te żywieniowe, swoje grzeszki, np. czekoladki czy ciasto oraz pomiary typu waga, % tkanki tłuszczowej, muskulaturę czy pomiary różnych partii ciała. \r\n\r\nDzienniczek umożliwia przeglądanie historii, ale spokojnie! Możesz zaznaczyć co chcesz pokazać znajomym czy najbliższym, jeśli nie chcesz żeby widzieli intymne szczegóły z Twojego życia po prostu je odznacz i już. Wciąż będą w dzienniczku, ale tylko Ty o tym będziesz wiedział.\r\n\r\nDzienniczek w wersji premium jest synchronizowany z serwerem dzięki czemu nie stracisz swoich zapisków kiedy zgubisz urządzenie czy zechcesz zmienić na inne. \r\n\r\nTIMER TRENINGOWY\r\nZasada działania timera polega na tym, że możesz trenować w interwałach działających w tle. Możesz wykonać trening typu TABATA czy HIIT, czy np. marszo-biegi. Ustawiasz dowolny czas trwania wysiłku, czas trwania odpoczynku oraz ilość rund. Np. bieganie przez 3 minuty i marsz 1 minuta. Wkładasz telefon do kieszeni, a gongi informują Cię co masz robić. Po treningu zapiszesz go automatycznie w dzienniczku. \r\n\r\nABC DIETETYCZNE*\r\nTo słowniczek haseł dietetycznych wytłumaczonych najprostszym z możliwych języków. Jeśli jakieś hasło jest niejasne, np. insulina, glukagon, nietolerancja to znajdziesz je właśnie tutaj. Słowniczek co miesiąc będzie uzupełniany o nowe hasła.\r\n\r\nPORADNIK DIETETYCZNY*\r\nTutaj znajdziesz odpowiedzi na najczęściej poszukiwane pytania, np. czy kawa jest zdrowa, czy mogę schudnąć z brzucha robiąc brzuszki. Poradnik co miesiąc będzie aktualizowany o nowe hasła.\r\n\r\nAplikacja została opracowana przez grupę dietetyków klinicznych Poradni Ajwen oraz mistrza kuchni. Każda rada została sprawdzona na pacjentach poradni dietetycznej, a każda potrawa faktycznie ugotowana i zjedzona.\r\n\r\nAplikacja będzie stale rozbudowywana o nowe funkcjonalności.

            "The entire game is a \"pay to win\" nightmare... It is designed to artificially limit your progress in as many ways as you can think of. You cant upgrade your units without \"shards\" which are completely random. Worse, there is also an insultingly low \"daily gold limit.\" Gold is also required to make any upgrades. Worse, if you try to fight without leveling up, you will actually LOSE all of your hard earned progress. THE ONLY WAY TO WIN THIS GAME, IS TO NEVER PLAY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!",
            "Normally I don't like these types of games (auto battlers), but this is actually the first one that I've enjoyed. The game has quite a bit of strategy to it and oozes quality. The monetization system is questionable of course, it's pay-to-win and that is why I will not spend any money on it (I would happily have had the game as a premium title instead) and the game will get old quite fast for me because of that. But for now it is quite fun.",
            "Its a expensive game and you will not win if you never pay that why i notice. The winning rate will totally drop and you will done nothing once you stop spending. Gain no experience as well when loosing in the season pass. They will give just a star for wagon which will take 4 to 8 hours. You will enjoy playing at first but will loose interest in the long run",
            "Great game, I've been playing for a couple of months now without spending a cent. Quite playable without paying, although progess is slow after reaching certain level. Good variety of units but simple enough to relax and enjoy. Also you choose if you want to watch adds for resources. My only complaint is that, lacking resources, it is difficult to upgrade units, and therefore change strategies, once you are at a certian level. But overall a great game!",
            "Update fail. Game now crashes immediately after the 1st splash screen. Anyway it's just a cash grab. The now rampamt \"battle pass\" last barely a week & doesnt grant enogu to be worth buying even if it lasted a month or more like most others do. No real strategy, just whoever buys the most, wins & no real game as combat is entirely automated."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "The best non intrusive translation app I've ever used thus far. Translated text, SMS, photos, and the new features as of Sept I1 is translating spoken languages. I'm very happy with the app. You can also click on an application and it will translate the app before you even get started using it. Now you tell me how great that is??? Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",
            "This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

            "Sometimes, this app works very well. It gives me perfect translations. But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

Master Yang instructs and demonstrates \"The Standing Eight Pieces of Brocade\", the most popular set of beginner-friendly Qigong healing exercises. This includes 30 minutes of follow-along exercise and then 30 minutes of detailed explanation of how and why the exercises work. These gentle breathing, stretching and strengthening movements improve the Qi (energy) and blood circulation in your body, stimulate your immune system and make you feel great.\r\nKnown in China as the Ba Duan Jin (健身八段錦), The Eight Pieces of Brocade has been practiced for over 1,000 years. Also included are the 'secret words' - poems that have preserved each exercise, which contain the key to each of these ancient medical qigong movements\r\nAfter you practice along with the easy-to-follow movements, you'll enjoy a fascinating qigong lecture by Master Yang.\r\n\r\nThe videos are organized into three main sections:\r\n1. \"Analysis\" - A short demonstration of each qigong exercise with instructional voiceover to introduce each exercise\r\n2. \"Demonstration\" - A follow-along continuous demonstration section in which Dr. Yang performs each piece with multiple repetitions\r\n3. \"Lecture\" - A one-on-one class in which Dr. Yang instructs each exercise with more detail and qigong theory\r\n\r\nOnce you have learned the qigong exercises from the \"Analysis and \"Lecture\" sections, you may simply follow along with Dr. Yang using the the continuous \"Demonstration\" video.\r\n\r\nThe standing eight brocades qigong set includes exercises to calm the mind, stretch your body, strengthen the teeth, improve digestion, heal the internal organs, boost your immunity and much more.\r\n\r\nEach piece of the Brocades should be practiced by beginners 6 - 8 times to start. When you begin, only perform each exercise for the number of repetitions that feels comfortable. As your health improves, you may increase the number of repetitions up to 12, 24 or even 32 times. Don't skip any of the exercises or practice out of order.\r\n\r\nThis is a convenient training tool you can bring anywhere, to access this amazingly powerful exercise whenever it fits best into your day.\r\n\r\nWhether you are a beginner or a qigong master already, these amazing exercises offer the perfect combination of relaxation and full-body stretching exercise. You'll enjoy reduced stress, a stronger immune system and a deeper awareness of your mind, body and spirit. You will develop important skills for immediate stress-relief to relieve anxiety and/or post-traumatic stress disorder or just relax, rejuvenate and maintain a healthy baseline of a calm and balanced mind and nervous system.\r\n\r\nQi-Gong means \"energy-work\". Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body's Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. Some Qigong is practiced sitting or standing still, while other Qigong can be a kind of moving meditation. This gentle stretching Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to enhance healing, raise up your spirit and generally improve your quality of life.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading our app!

        "description": "The Division of Rheumatology at the University of Cape Town is very actively involved in teaching, service delivery and research.\r\n\r\nTeaching is directed at medical students in their 4th 5th and 6th years of training. There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",

After I've opened the 3 chests, I tap no thanks and another round of rewards keep coming back. This keeps on going and I never get to play the game. Please fix this.",

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. 😊",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

And what if cancer is riddled the entire body bone structure the whole skeleton I would like to see details of that I would like to be able to ask questions and have them answered. I know that's a lot.",
            "I can see clearly how things work now, suggestion... the animation of the lungs isn't clear because it is covered by muscle. Also please show how the circulatory system flows throughout the body. Other than that, great job.",
            "Very less information.... and details, I would give it 5 stars, if you do some work on its anotomy also. like giving cross-section of interal organs and mentioning it's details. It's really very basic app. I think it's for primary school students. It is not at all useful for college students.",
            "It is really helpful for the beginners. My younger brother had learned all the organs so quickly bcoz of this app. I'm very much satisfied with this app. Thnkq so much for making such an amazing app. 😊❣",
            "It's pretty good, but has some obvious things missing: Full system is only viewable for male anatomy. I thought at one point you could overlay outer body so you could see where the organs are, but I can't see it now. The animation for digestion really just shows through the colon, not the whole system. The demarcation between large and small intestine is unclear.. would be nice to be able to see how they interact."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying.

            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

        "description": "This app Color Atlas of Skin Diseases - Dermatology Atlas is for medical student, doctors, dermatologist, nurses and other health practitioners to understand Dermatology Atlas with Treatment. The cases contain pictures (Zoom in/Out of illustrated color images), etiology and treatment of many skin infections.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2. History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin.

About quick translation, the user does not want to translate every text he copied, here I advise you to use the Google Translator method by showing a floating icon. Often user want to purchase app with one-time payment, add this option and set the price you want.",
            "I really love the app. However, not following the chat option. If I could add someone to chat with from contact list and the other person talk in Spanish and I see it in English and vice-versa that would be optimal. I dont understand who I'm chatting with? What am I missing? I understand now this is a person next to person item. Real time face to face. If you could work with slatch.io and mix in a realtime translated chat you would take over the world.",
            "The app is good enough, everyone should use it, there are many other features in it, but one thing I did not like about this app at all was that it takes too much time to open this app by resetting it and this app has a lot All the advertisements also keep coming which disturb us please try to ment your application.😊 By the way your application is best",
            "It's really very helpful... But the adds makes me disturb. Sometimes I'm in a urgent work but this time I want to operate this app and it doesn’t work properly only for this adds.. Without this problem It's really very good..",
            "Very nice app I love it . So easy to use and helpfully for any one. You can translate any word or sentences easly but the problem,!!!! There are a lot of ads that I don't want to see. Is there any way to get rid of this dilemma ???"

        "description": "Kelenjar tiroid adalah kelenjar kecil di bagian leher yang berguna pada hampir semua proses di dalam tubuh. Kelenjar tiroid di leher menghasilkan hormon yang bisa menjadi tidak seimbang dan dapat menimbulkan penyakit. Hormon ini bisa sangat aktif atau juga kurang aktif. Jika penyakit homron ini tidak diatasi dengan benar bisa membahayakan dan bsa menyebabkan pembengkakan kelenjar tiroid di leher.\r\n\r\nMeski begitu, kondisi ini bisa diobati dengan menggunakan perawatan rumahan atau juga obat kelenjar tiroid dari dokter. Artikel ini akan membahas semua tentang kelenjar tiroid, penyakit tiroid, ciri-ciri kelenjar tiroid yang mengalami pembengkakan, dan obat kelenjar tird.\r\nApa itu kelenjar tiroid?\r\n\r\nKelenjar tiroid adalah kelenjar kecil berbentuk kupu-kupu yang terletak di bagian pangkal leher tepat di bawah jakun dan di atas tulang dada. Kelenjar endokrin adalah bagian dari jaringan kelenjar yang rumit yaitun sistem endokrin.\r\n\r\nMelalui hormon yang dihasilkannya, kelenjar tiroid berguna untuk hampir semua proses metabolisme dalam tubuh. Selain itu, kelenjar tiroid juga mengatur energi dalam tubuh, suhu tubuh, dan pertumbuhan jaringan tubuh.\r\n\r\nHormon yang dihasilkan kelenjar tiroid ini juga memengaruhi kerja organ tubuh seperti jantung, pencernaan, otot, dan sistem saraf.\r\nApa itu penyakit tiroid?\r\n\r\nPenyakit tiroid adalah masalah umum yang menyebabkan ketidakseimbangan hormon tiroid dalam tubuh Anda. Penyakit tiroid ini terjadi ketika kelenjar tiroid di leher tidak cukup memproduksi hormon atau menjadi kurang aktif (hipotiroid), terlalu banyak memproduksi hormon atau terlalu aktif (hipertiroid), membengkak atau gondok.\r\n\r\nPenyakit tiroid ini lebih umum terjadi pada wanita dibandingkan pada pria. Penyakit tiroid juga dapat memengaruhi semua orang pada usia berapa pun\r\n\r\nMeskipun efek dari penyakit tiroid bisa membuat Anda tidak nyaman, tapi sebagian besar kondisi akibat gangguan kelenjar tiroid ini dapat diatasi dengan baik jika didiagnosis dan dirawat dengan benar.\r\nPenyebab penyakit tiroid\r\n\r\nPenyakit tiroid secara umum disebabkan oleh produksi hormon yang dihasilkan kelenjar ini tidak memadai untuk bekerja sesuai fungsinya.\r\n\r\nKetika kelenjar tiroid di leher Anda tidak menghasilkan cukup hormon, keseimbangan reaksi kimia dalam tubuh Anda dapat terganggu. Ada beberapa penyebab, termasuk penyakit autoimun, pengobatan untuk hipertiroidisme, terapi radiasi, operasi tiroid dan obat-obatan tertentu.\r\n\r\nHormon yang dihasilkan oleh kelenjar tiroid adalah triiodothyronine (T3) dan tiroksin (T4). Kedua hormon ini memiliki dampak yang sangat besar pada kesehatan Anda dan memengaruhi semua aspek metabolisme Anda.\r\n\r\nHormon yang dihasilkan kelenjar tiroid di leher juga mengatur penggunaan lemak dan karbohidrat dalam tubuh, membantu mengendalikan suhu tubuh Anda, memengaruhi denyut jantung Anda, dan membantu mengatur produksi protein.\r\n\r\nPenyakit tiroid juga dapat disebabkan oleh infeksi, seperti virus atau bakteri, yang bekerja dengan cara yang sama seperti antibodi menyebabkan peradangan pada kelenjar. Obat-obatan seperti interferon dan amiodarone, diketahui menyebabkan kerusakan sel-sel tiroid dan menyebabkan penyakit tiroid.\r\n\r\nSelain itu, kelenjar tiroid yang menghasilkan hormon lebih banyak atau terlalu aktif (hipertiroidisme) umumnya disebabkan oleh penyakit Graves, gondok multinoduler toksik, dan adenoma toksik, walaupun masih banyak penyakit lain yang bisa menyebabkannya.\r\nApa saja gejala penyakit tiroid?\r\nHipertiroid\r\n\r\nGejala penyakit kelenjar tiroid akibat hipertiroid terbagi menjadi dua yaitu gejala umum dan gejala spesifik terhadap organ tubuh di mana hormon ini bekerja.\r\n\r\nGejala umum dari hipertiroid yaitu tidak tahan terhadap udara panas, mudah lelah, leher membesar, penurunan berat badan, sering lapar, sering buang air besar.",

            "This game is really fun I have been playing it for a while and I love it. You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwU🥰🤩",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "There is no doubt that the Muslim Pro App is a fantastic application and it is the best of its type. I consult it every day as it is very useful to me in communicating with my Creator. May Allah reward the Developers adequately, Aameen. However I wish to inform you that whenever an update is received, downloaded and installed on the Muslim Pro App, all information on the Birthday section on the Calendar is wiped out. Please what can be done to keep the information intact.",
            "Very good app, however i preferred the previous version's method of marking verses as read. Now I have to click the three dots to mark each verse as read and to save progress. Very tedious for each verse. Edit: They have not changed the Quran system and did not even respond to my email regarding this issue. Very unprofessional and arrogant.",
            "My lifetime premium version had worked very well so far but today It does not work at all on my huawei P30 Pro. Last android update. Please help. In addition, app on huawei app gallery canot be upgraded to premium version.. I will re-rate once I fixed. .................................................. Updated on 21 October 2020, it is working good right now.",
            "Alhamdulillah The Muslim Pro app is always reliable, and accurate. It is an excellent reminder to read the Qur'an, and have inspiration. Also there are plenty of ways within the app to connect to the community and now with the virtual Hajj journey it is a blessing. It also helps me with being on time, having the Adhan play for the obligatory prayers. Signing up for the lifetime membership is a sure way to always be connected.",
            "After I changed device..from asus max pro m1 to xiaomi redmi note 8 it gives error and I can't use my 1 year subscription...i try to subscribe with 1 month subscription..my money has been deducted but still..it gives error..

        "comments": [
            "I really enjoyed this app it's actually really cool! Now that it was Holloween I tried it... Yes it is neat. The only issue is that you can use the app just to see if you like it and it will give you a lot of options but I didn't like that if you didn't purchase this app... You get cut off and you cut off your potential customers to early I understand that you're goal is to make money off your app.Im not sure about the purchase I don't know what more it has to offer just get cut off .",
            "When signing up for monthly pro, the app tells you your first 3 days are free and \"at the end of the 3 day trial period an auto-renewable subscription will be activated automatically.\" This is a lie! There is no free trial; you will be charged immediately! Luckily I disputed the charges with Google and got my money back, but beware y'all, there is no free trial, regardless of what my screenshot of the app clearly says.",
            "This is an awesome app! There are two paid option that are reasonable and so worth it. With so many cool options and features that are available to try for free you will definitely stay busy and will want to the paid version and the more you share the smarter the app gets so you can't go wrong. I Definitely recommend this app.",
            "Luv 💗. I use this app all the time. I love it. The only thing id say it needs to improve on is the fact that there are not many options that work for group photos. Most onky work for selfies",
            "I dropped off the one star and reduced it to zero. The devs responded about getting the 1 year option and everything was wrong. Here's what you have to do: cancel your subscription and wait for a little bit. You will then have MANY places where they nag you to go PRO and from there you can choose either subscription option. You cannot do like the dev said. This is sure a lot more trouble than it's worth. UNINSTALLED! ---ORIGINAL review: I'm giving this ONE star because of their business model. Like other's, the first thing I saw was an offer of 3 day free trial with $4.99 PER MONTH after, plus another offer (that I can no longer find) for $9.99 per year. I might go for the yearly option except for the fact that everything they do seems shady. There are NO options and that includes no way within the app to tell it not to send notifications. I immediately was targeted with a notification and after a few of those, I had to go into the phone's notification settings to block them. They constantly nag me to share my pictures on their web site so they can have free use of my creations which they make it VERY difficult to remove what you shared and changed your mind. The online website provides NO options to delete your shares. Somewhere, I saw a recommendation for this app but it didn't give a clue about how expensive it was (even on the App Store, there is little to warn you). You find this out right away when you first run it. Positive note: the app itself is very fun and very addictive. It's all internet based functions, very little is actually on the phone taking up your memory. If you have weak internet or poor signal, this will be frustrating slow. If I can't find the overpriced $9.99 per year option, I'm not continuing this grossly overpriced monthly subscription. It's fun, but not THAT fun. With the lack of information and options, I am suspect of this company's motives. There is so much wrong with this company and it's functions it's kind of scary."

My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress.

The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "I have been a user of this app for over 10 years. I am a huge fan but, while I appreciate your need to create revenue, the addition of ads that play sound before you even get to the ad is simply infuriating, and is leading me to consider uninstalling. I really do not want to do this, but I cannot fathom how you thought this was in any way a good idea. Please remove the ads with sound. Honestly, get rid of this garbage or watch this die. \"We try to limit these ads\" like hell you do. Lip-service",
            "One of my most used apps, one of the only ones that puts a smile on my face (most of the time). The ads arnt too bad, all except the ones that plays music and is animated. Whoever allowed those to pop up and dissables my music or youtube running on the background has a special place in hell for them 🙂🖕",
            "The app functions well, but half the memes are political and not very funny. I would love to use this app, but I am uninstalling it because I don't look at memes to hear endless political views. I think myself and the majority of users want the moderator to accept less political memes and more that are funny to everyone, regardless of their polictical preference. Otherwise, a filter option would be helpful to sort through categories of memes and avoid political ones.",
            "Epic app, except for august 1st, but there is something im not happy with on it, every now and then on gallery it will only show memes from august 1st (on august 1st every meme gets past moderation) and it kinda sucks since august 1st memes usually suck",
            "Was a great app loved it untill recently when the added ads which were easy to pass over untill a few days later when the ads started playing music even when they weren't on screen."

            "Easy to follow. Like the way it is divided into catagories so it is quite easy to find the specific phrase looked for. Learning the pronunciation was easy and quick. Thank you.",
            "The ADS, whew!! Lost a star there. Otherwise good app, the audio is great, easy to understand, unlike some that have a robotic voice that mispronounces the words. Useful phases (in formal language), I think it will be great for building phase recognition. Also really like the \"favorites\" option where you can save words/phrases to a separate tab for easy studying. Recommend being able to read Hangul. I'm curious if there's more content available with the 4.99 upgrade? Seems pricey if not.",

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "I've been searching for an app that gives me the key and bpm of a song and be consistently reliable and easy to use and this app is the closest I've found. However it doesn't detect the key correctly on most of the minor songs even after buying the upgrade. So until this is fixed it's only getting 2 stars from me.",
            "It doesn't completely mute the lead solo, the only option is to reduce the lead sound which affects almost everything. I really don't know what this app is for but I thought I can create backing track from the original music. It's not usefull",
            "No minor scales! I wish this would read minor scales. Instead it only gives the major options to find you key. This is an incomplete app. 2 stars off. Now I need to go find a real app. It works great, but missing a whole half of the program.",
            "Very well laid out. All of the features I want are on the main play screen and are easily found and used.",
            "Great app; for transposing songs, changing tempos, plus other nice added features, including vocal exercises."

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.\r\n\r\nPathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen.

            "I'm very picky with games, and this just managed to get past that barrier with stunning graphics and controls, its just a couple things that caught me off-guard. 1. Please add an arachniphobic option for those who need it! 2. Its hard to really progress when the banner keeps coming. 3. I feel like there isn't a good way to get farther. Every time you uninstall it or stop playing for a certain amount of time, it will wipe your data! 4. Everytime you jump, sometimes it pauses it for some reason :\\",
            "The graphics are incredibly amazing for a game that does not lagg very much. I like how tjere are a lot of things to do and you can live either indoor or outdoor and can raise a family too! Though the adds banner does get reaaallly annoying. It comes like everytime I go to sleep. And the skins are quite expensive. I understand you want some money, but maybe you should lower the amount of times the banner shows up.",
            "I underestimated this game. At first, I expected it to be a low quality game like most other simulators, but I was wrong! The graphics are great, I love the family feature and the customization, and especially the house area! Of course, the game can start to feel repetitive and slow, sometimes it just depends on your mood. I think it would be interesting to have more areas (like a modern world, a park, stores), or have more landscapes, like desert and snow. Overall, this is a great game!",
            "I love this game it is the best no bugs or gitches but i do want ,new places like the basement in the house and more mushrooms not amanitas , and you can add upstairs in the house or a grocery store and i wish the cats in the game could have kittens and for the mice more babies at 1 time pls, and add humans! well nice game!",
            "Still too sensitive and now the game is way too difficult. you spend all your time gathering instead od exploring like before. and by the time you half finish one quest you're too tired and hunrgy to get much farther. in short, this game got worse since I last played it in 2017"

The only thing I could say could be improved is the amount of ink you get. The bosses have GIANT vehicles and I'm on level 550 and dont have much ink. The ink cost so much after you buy about 5 lots and it doesnt give you that much. Overall, I love this game!",

New enemies and bosses in the future would be nice. Maybe harder difficulties with them having cannons and a smarter AI that moved on its own.",
            "It's pretty simple and addicting. I just wish it were more challenging. Right now the AI reacts to whatever you're doing. It won't charge on its own or anything, you basically control both your car and the other car. You can also overpower yourself to the point of almost everything being too easy to be any fun. Wall-less maps are pretty much worthless because you can just ram the other car off immediately. Stronger and more intelligent enemies would be a great addition."

        "description": "Stream or download these daily Qi Gong 30-Day Challenge workouts with Lee Holden.\r\nDevelop a daily habit to improve your health and immunity with easy short video lessons by Qigong Master Lee Holden. Small file size, free sample videos, and a single IAP to unlock all content.\r\nThis simple series of 30 short daily routines is designed to cut your stress levels and boost your energy as efficiently as possible. Anybody can find a few minutes each day to practice qi gong, and that’s long enough to shift you out of that “fight or flight” stress mode and help you relax deeply.\r\nAfter 30 days, you’ll have built a healthy habit that helps you improve your mood, clear tension, and recharge quickly every day. This series is also a perfect way to introduce someone you care about to qi gong.\r\nYou’ll feel better on day one, and as you continue to progress and revitalize your mind, body, and spirit, you’ll find that wonderful things happen in all aspects of your life.\r\n•\t30 short daily qi gong workouts\r\n•\tWeek 1: Build your foundation of self-discipline\r\n•\tWeek 2: Enliven your Mind, Body and Spirit\r\n•\tWeek 3: Feel abundant Qi (energy) and great health\r\n•\tWeek 4: Express positive energy in all areas of your life\r\n•\tMirror-view beginner qigong moves to the left and right.\r\n•\tLow-impact, whole body exercise done sitting or standing.\r\n•\tNo experience needed; beginner-friendly follow-along workout. \r\nEnergy is the great mystery of life. The ancients described Qi as the source of vitality, energy, health, and well-being. Where does it come from? How can it benefit us? Where do we get more of it? Qi Gong translates as the “skill at working with energy.”\r\nIn this routine, you will learn how to move with intrinsic strength. The routine begins by activating internal energy, getting it to circulate and flow. The program continues with\r\nrelaxed stretching exercises to free up tension and tightness. The routine culminates with flowing, meditative movements that strengthen the body's vitality and energy system.\r\n•\tDiscover how to increase energy naturally\r\n•\tSimple stretches to clear tightness and tension\r\n•\tTechniques to cultivate deep lasting vitality\r\n•\tFlowing movements to enliven the body, mind, and spirit\r\nQi-Gong means \"energy-work\". Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body's Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. Some Qigong is practiced sitting or standing still, while other Qigong can be a kind of moving meditation. This gentle Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress, increase energy, enhance healing, and generally improve your quality of life.\r\n      \r\n    Qigong increases the quantity of energy in the body and improves the quality of your circulation through energy pathways, known as meridians. Qigong is sometimes called \"acupuncture without needles.\" \r\n     \r\n    Similar to yoga, Qigong can stimulate the entire body deeply with low-impact movement and develop a stronger mind/body connection. The slow, relaxed movements are widely recognized for their health benefits, such as boosting your immune response, strengthening the internal organs, muscles, joints, spine, and bones, and developing abundant energy. A Qigong session makes one feel strong, centered, and happy. \r\n     \r\nQigong can be effective in helping people with insomnia, stress-related disorders, depression, back pain, arthritis, high blood pressure, and problems with the immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, bioelectric circulatory system, lymphatic system, and digestive system.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading our free app!
