            "it seems okay on the surface, and the questions are pretty basic the only problem I see is the phrasing on the page before you start answering questions. it describes autism as a scale. the issue with this is that it makes autism seem more like a step ladder (as if someone can be \"a bit autistic\" or \"very autistic\") when really, the whole \"high/low functioning\" idea only describes how much people mask, which is incredibly harmful to their mental health.",
            "Why can't you put \"?\" for don't understand or it opens up and you can check the check box and or other: write what you mean but allow lots of room, also in the left corner you can push give feedback. And remember you need to make it word like it's for a small child that needs to understand, because that's my comprehension level 🤔.",
            "Am aware that an evaluation through a psychologist is fundamental for proper diagnosis, yet this app gives you a good idea if you in the spectrum or not. I have been obsessed with numbers, patterns and memorizing items since early childhood and found other little quirks along the way as I got older. This test gives me a rating of 33 percent and I see a good bit of truth in that. Thank you. I have shared it with many of my friends and the results are quite amazing and spot on.",
            "The app design is quite nice and technically it works well. However, the contents are really quite... stereotypical. I think they're stupid. It might as well straight up ask me 'Do you think that you have autism?'. Not every autistic person hates socialising. Not every autistic person loves numbers, dates and patterns. Not every aspie or autist struggle with imagination, reading others or planning. It gave me an average score - A group of real psychologists gave me an ASD (and ADD) diagnosis.",
            "Good test, but the interpretation of the result is just bad statistics. Look up the prosecutor's paradox. -- Thanks for the reply...  The app itself is fine... but the fact of making an app that offers this kind of test is gonna get you 1 star from me... sorry!  It's actually not a guide at all, since the probability of you being autistic is very low no matter what you score.  The only solid interpretation is that if you score like a \"neurotypical\" then you probably are one.  So maybe it should be called the Awesomely Neurotypical Test.  The result of tests that make people think they might be autistic is: 1) they clog up the GP and AMH with people who are clearly not autistic, making it even more difficult for adults with ASD to get diagnosed 2) the make people think that \"we're all on the spectrum\", which belittles the suffering that ASD causes.  So, yeah... 1 star."

        "description": "Autism Assisted is developed by the Computer-Human Interaction and Social Experience Lab at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. We are committed to towards creating a medium for delivery of important, relevant and reliable information for individuals affected by ASD. Our vision for Autism Assisted sees it being the following\r\n\r\nSafe and reliable knowledge bank:\r\n\r\nASD, especially in third world countries, is poorly understood and a knowledge base must be created with the best information available from work done around the world. It is also important that this knowledge is made accessible to the largest possible group. We do this by creating information with several dimensions like web, mobile, print, video, languages and accessibility support to ensure we remove as many barriers to this knowledge as we can. Information is also verified by medical professionals with certification that provide key insights and reviews.\r\n\r\nSource of hope and togetherness:\r\n\r\nASD is a difficult thing to go through for individuals, caretakers and family members.

When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",

            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \r\nThe verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\r\nMITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use.

            "Very good game! Thus, for language it is important 1. To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",

            "It's a great app. with core vocabulary! You can form sentences, edit/customize pages and pictures, add pages and pictures, and it's super easy to navigate! Anddd it's free!! I highly recommend this app!!",
            "I'm too old to figure this out.... Need something that lets me use the keyboard to type and then read that out loud. Maybe have a library of phrase I've input.... Communication outside of my computer is too tedious no matter what.",
            "This app has been a life-saver; we use it to support our communications with our child on the autistic spectrum. The app in itself has to be personalized, and it is NOT easy.. It is time-consuming to get the personalized images (although they have an extensive generic image bank) up, as well as the pronunciation you wish on specific names or words. And, it is nearly impossible to transfer a profile between android devices. Yes, the app could be better, and it is a shame there is no more technical support offered for it, but I am giving it five stars because it is free, and it has been a massive help to us. Thanks!",
            "I found this yesterday and have been playing around with it-I have 18 years experience working for children who have execptionalities. This is a wonderful app for anybody who may need a voice at times but do not have professional supports in place yet. My son has found it easy to navigate and loves that I was able to personalize the labels. The only issue I've had so far pertains to rearranging the pictures, they didn't stay where I put them.",
            "Trying numerous augmented communication apps for my daughter and this one was the closest to what she use to have on the ipad when the device died. Awesome app. Very easy to set up, a lot of setting options to customize for the needs of the individual and it does not matter how long she pushes the button, it will say the word. Speech can be a little odd but this app gives you the ability to use other voice apps to change the sound. After trying quite a few, this is the one which fit all my needs. Will be donating money to the developer as soon as I can. Great job and thank you so very much!"

Not to mention, if the user has trouble reading, they will need someone to read the screen. I like the concept & some of the topics. For example, the first lesson is about how not everyone is your friend (which some child or people w/autism struggle with). There's also a lesson on online safety.",
            "I am a speech pathologist who teaches children social skills every day. This app has the right idea, and has selected some good concepts to teach kids. However, it is not done well. There is a lot of text and not a lot of action. It is basically hearing a lesson and then taking a quiz. I was really hoping to get to play through some actual scenarios. Knowing the types of kids who would benefit from the skills taught, they would get bored pretty quickly.",
            "I completely disagree with you teaching kids it's okay to \"white lie\". There are ways you can teach kids to speak the truth without hurting people's feelings.",

            "Excellent app to gain an understanding of basic and more complex social skills! Fun and colourful character designs and very well animated, practical and theory questions, has clear examples and lists that really make it simple to digest. Essential for anyone who struggles socially. Super app! :)  Couple minor issues, during \"when we argue with friends\" after \"what kind of statements..\" the characters disappear. And during \"going to a friends house\" quiz \"Ellie is going to a party\" it accepts the dog food option as the answer."

One thing though is that there is always someone different watching my son, I.e. myself, my husband, his brothers, my father, his teachers etc. So I was wondering if there was any plan to make this app online, so that multiple people can log in to update the one profile?",

Fun emotions and colors. Different/special ways of the app being decorated. It would be amzing if we could chose these things myself!",

To achieve the best possible outcome, research shows the importance of a 360 approach where caregivers play a pivotal role.\r\n\r\nDo you wish it was easier and faster to find trusted information about Autism?\r\n\r\nLearn Autism is a learning tool to empower caregivers with key knowledge and tips on how best to support their child.\r\n\r\nInspired by Autism parents who understand how overwhelming a diagnosis can be, Learn Autism’s goal is to serve as a trusted resource that is both accessible and affordable. Our annual subscription is less than $0.07 per day.\r\n\r\nOur team of OT’s (occupational therapists), SLP’s (speech language pathologists), behavioral therapists, play therapists and sensory experts break down every component of parenting and caring for a child on the Autism spectrum. We also provide a variety of play-based and learning activities to support your child’s social, emotional and educational growth.\r\n\r\nLed by Dr Stephen Shore, author of “Autism for Dummies”, who himself is on the Autism spectrum, and our dedicated team of experts, veteran parents and Autism advocates, we are committed to providing diverse perspectives on the common issues that ASD parents and caregivers may encounter. Learn Autism empowers you to make informed choices and alleviates the stress that comes with the uncertainty of an Autism diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAre you seeing behaviors in your child that make you wonder if they have Autism or has your child just received an Autism diagnosis?\r\n\r\nIn our bite-size videos we talk about red flags, play and intervention strategies, real life stories, teens and growing pains, making friends and building relationships to navigating the workplace and how adulthood looks for people on the Autism spectrum.\r\n\r\nLearn Autism delivers answers to all of these questions through short video tutorials, downloadable workbooks, live webinars and access to our exclusive community network to further your learning experience. We empower people on the spectrum and their caregivers to make fulfilling and productive lives the rule rather than the exception.\r\n\r\nAlready have an account?

Somehow I managed to find the section of the app where you can browse profiles, but since its not obvious, I've forgotten which icon it is. Not enough people, despite A.S.D being 1% of the population.",

            "I appreciate the thought of creating a dating app for people like myself that have autism but the fact you people can't even have people show up in my area is annoying, fix the app and make it more accessible",
            "I downloaded the app with high hopes, only to see that there are literally zero accounts within 100km of my location. I hadn't even spoken to anyone, and saw that two people from across the country had visited my page and blocked me for no reason. I think the app is fake.",
            "I signed up got to the confirmation email and found the confirmation email in my spam box, went in and clicked to confirm email but it takes me back to page requesting email for the confirmation link. Ive looped back and forth multiple times and cant get past that page even though I repeatedly confirmed email."

No parent is ever prepared to hear that a child is anything other than happy and healthy, and an ASD diagnosis can be particularly frightening. You may be unsure about how to best help your child, or confused by conflicting treatment advice. Or you may have been told that ASD is an incurable, lifelong condition, leaving you concerned that nothing you do will make a difference.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that ASD is not something a person simply “grows out of,” there are many treatments that can help children acquire new skills and overcome a wide variety of developmental challenges. From free government services to in-home behavioral therapy and school-based programs, assistance is available to meet your child’s special needs and help them learn, grow, and thrive in life.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re looking after a child with ASD, it’s also important to take care of yourself. Being emotionally strong allows you to be the best parent you can be to your child in need. These parenting tips can help by making life with an autistic child easier.\r\nWhen your child has autism\r\nLearn about autism. The more you know about autism spectrum disorder, the better equipped you’ll be to make informed decisions for your child. Educate yourself about the treatment options, ask questions, and participate in all treatment decisions.\r\n\r\nBecome an expert on your child. Figure out what triggers your kid’s challenging or disruptive behaviors and what elicits a positive response. What does your child find stressful or frightening? Calming? Uncomfortable? Enjoyable? If you understand what affects your child, you’ll be better at troubleshooting problems and preventing or modifying situations that cause difficulties.\r\n\r\nAccept your child, quirks and all. Rather than focusing on how your autistic child is different from other children and what he or she is “missing,” practice acceptance. Enjoy your kid’s special quirks, celebrate small successes, and stop comparing your child to others. Feeling unconditionally loved and accepted will help your child more than anything else.\r\n\r\nDon’t give up. It’s impossible to predict the course of autism spectrum disorder. Don’t jump to conclusions about what life is going to be like for your child. Like everyone else, people with autism have an entire lifetime to grow and develop their abilities.",

        "description": "If your child -- or the child of a close friend or relative -- has just received a diagnosis of autism, you are probably feeling baffled and overwhelmed. It is never easy to learn that someone you love has a serious health or developmental condition. Learning all you can about the disorder -- and where to get help -- will ease your fear and confusion. It can also provide the tools you need to find the support that children with autism -- and you -- really need.\r\n\r\nHow to Identify Children With Autism\r\nAutism is a developmental disorder that appears in early childhood. Autism is the most common condition in a related constellation of disorders known as autism spectrum disorders, also called ASDs. Other autism spectrum disorders include Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder, or PDD. Autism and other autism spectrum disorders can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms and degree of impairment -- ranging from mild to severe -- are different for every child.\r\n\r\nSome features of autism include:\r\n\r\nSocial withdrawal\r\nVerbal or nonverbal communication problems\r\nRigid and repetitive behavior\r\nIn severe cases, an autistic child may never learn to speak or make eye contact. But many children with autism and other autism spectrum disorders are able to live relatively normal lives.\r\nSigns and Symptoms in Children With Autism\r\nAutism usually appears before a child is 3 years old. Some signs of autism may be evident as early as 10 to 12 months, and certainly by 18 months.\r\n\r\nVarying widely, signs and symptoms in children with autism typically include:\r\n\r\nImpaired communication skills\r\nDifficulty making eye contact\r\nRepetitive behaviors and activities such as arm flapping, head banging, or twirling an object over and over\r\nRigid behavior and difficulty with change and transitions\r\nNarrow range of interests and activities\r\nWhat Causes Autism?\r\nExperts do not know exactly what causes autism. In the past, people blamed parenting practices, which added a burden of guilt and shame on parents already struggling to cope with a disabled child. Today, most scientists believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors cause autism.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent research confirms multiple genetic abnormalities that can predisposition someone to autism. Several genes have been implicated. In addition, there may be metabolic or biochemical factors that can cause autism spectrum disorders. Other research is looking at environmental triggers, including exposure to certain viruses. But a number of comprehensive studies have totally disproved the purported link between vaccines and ASD.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of diagnosed cases of autism in the U.S. and around the world. Experts do not know if this is because the disorder is actually on the rise, or if doctors are simply diagnosing it more effectively. We should learn more answers to questions like these over the next few years. That's because many researchers are currently looking into autism's origins, prevalence, and treatment.",

Man, your heart is in the right direction! ❤️🙏🏼🙂 BTW, and I'm sure you know by now that most of ADHD, is not a brain illness, it is the results of trauma, when it occurs in early childhood where it has profound effects on the developing brain. A kinder Nation leads to a kinder world. ❤️",

The UI feels frozen at times, and the vibrations aren't at expected intervals. I hope it's not mining Bitcoin in the background because I don't know what else could make a rather basic app so sluggish. I hope you can fix the performance issues."

I would add a possibility to add \"to\" or not. Would be also nice to vary a quickness of a pronounced word as some kids may not be able to get all sounds. It will be also nice to change as color of a word which is pronounced to focus on it and create a link between receptive and written.",

I made the donation and got full access, but after I record my voice when I play it back it sounds like cracking, breaking.... it's not a good recording feature. Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",

Big issue though is that it needs internet access to open the app. Big turn off not being able to use the app at all in offline mode. If this was fixed would consider reinstalling and updating the score.",

Sharing a pdf via email didn't work (no PDF attached to email!).  Worse yet, Google Play denied a refund of the $3.49 purchase price, despite my  requesting the refund within less than an hour of purchase. I uninstalled the app, re-downloaded, and now all I have access to is the free version; I can't even use the limited functionality I paid for in the first place!  I've written to the developer to request a direct refund, and will update this review with their response."

That's why social interaction can be difficult and they can have problems to get integrated in the context. \r\n\r\nAutismind is a structured app with 10 different subjects, divided in 6 difficulty levels, with more than 1000 exercises to work the mental skills needed to develop the Theory of Mind. It requires the parent or professional implication to work with the kid, despite it's done with some interesting and motivating characteristics:\r\n\r\nVery easy and intuitive to navigate throw without help and it's very simple and clear.\r\n\r\nFeedback and positive reinforcement: the kid knows every time if the answer it's correct and there are verbal and visual rewards to make it more interesting.

            "We've been trying for a while, but my 2.5 year old is not interested in trying to repeat the words. I'll likely cancel after the first year. Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",
            "Kept seeing ads for this, so I downloaded it! Started the free trial before I decided to buy a subscription, and so glad I did! I couldn't even get a single activity done. There was no sound, the screen kept freezing and the app keeps force closing. Waste of time.",
            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",

        "description": "Talk To Me 100® Lite (free version) is a powerful, engaging tool for children who are learning to talk, or who have difficulty mastering verbal expression. An interactive teaching device, Talk To Me 100® allows the child - by pressing buttons - to see words, hear words, understand their meaning and experience the joy of communication. Using the pinch and swipe gestures, the board can be expanded and moved on the tablet as needed. This Free Version offers 9 of the most frequently used symbols and sounds. The full version is priced at $5.99 and offers 100 symbols and corresponding sounds.\r\n\r\nThe Talk To Me 100® Android App was developed by a Speech and Language Pathologist as a way to facilitate error-less communication (in which the learner never fails, but is supported in all communication attempts) to teach beginning language skills.\r\n\r\nThis new voice output app helps parents, teachers and therapists jump-start verbal expression for children who are struggling to communicate.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100® allows the learner to control their environment, and to signal the point of readiness to communicate. Talk To Me 100® also provides immediate and consistent feedback, allows for practice and repetition of 100 frequently used words throughout daily activities, provides fun and enjoyment and lets the learner become accustomed to touch screen use.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100® is designed to provide communication partners with 100 words organized in a predictable format to use in an unlimited choice of daily activities. Sydspeak created this app for children with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, speech and language disorders and other special needs. Talk To Me 100® provides communication partners with a core vocabulary to begin verbal expression for all functions of language: imitate, comment, answer, question, describe, retell, accept, reject, repeat, command, request, explain, persuade, maintain social relationship and influence.\r\n\r\nThe adult communication partner models one or more words by selecting the buttons and using their natural voice to speak the same words whether you are getting ready for school, eating dinner, reading or playing outside; opportunities for verbal interaction are unlimited.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100® provides a beginning augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution for people who have difficulty speaking. Once the learner begins to combine 2-3 words spontaneously to communicate a new or novel thought, they are well on their way to using more than 100 words, either using natural voice or using a more expanded and dynamic AAC device.\r\n\r\nThis Android app is a digital replica and companion to the original “child friendly” Talk To Me 100® available at www.sydspeak.com. Priced at $59, this tablet is similar in size and comes in a durable plastic case with 3AAA batteries. Research shows that when each communication partner uses their own personal voice output device, language acquisition is more efficient. For some children, a predictable pattern of images on a computer screen using the same child’s voice has more impact than pictures on paper with changing adult verbal interactions. For the first time, we now have a powerful communication system where both partners can have their own affordable and effective language device with the same voice and symbols.\r\n\r\nThe free version offers a sample of beginning language learning.\r\n\r\nI recently evaluated a 3 year old child who was nonverbal. His parents said he only spoke 2 words: “mama” and “bye”. When presented with the Talk To Me 100®, he began exploring the board, pressing the symbols and listening to the words. I began using my version on the tablet, and he immediately began imitating my words by pressing the symbols on his device. What sometimes takes months of therapy to achieve, he was imitating words within a few minutes!!!",

            "I really like this app, but there are a few glitches. I am unable to add/save items to the activity checklist as it is intended. It either doesn't save any or duplicates the first one. I also have to add one at a time, very specifically, in order for any to save. After about five successful items like this, it tries to duplicate the first one. Also, I am unable to have any activities with a checklist repeat weekly. I hope this gets fixed! Also, more offline capabilites would be great. :)",
            "I feel this app should be marked as in beta. It's so close to being great. I love that I can add my own photos or download a svg files to make my own icons. Roatines have to be my favorite. However I hate that I can't edit them once created. I have to delete the old roatine and make a whole new one. The app also doesn't work fully without logging on to the computer version. I've read the what's coming section and it's all very exciting. Number one problem- I can't mute the alarm.",
            "So far it's been kind of helpful but I desperately need the app to not throw a fit when I schedule things that overlap (I'm often doing things when I'm supposed to take my meds, these things don't conflict but rather its important that I take my meds in the middle of what I'm doing) also I'd find this worlds more helpful if I didn't have to schedule everything but could rather enter tasks that have to get done at some point that day with no stressful time limit",
            "I've only had the app for just over a week. And it has helped me so much get the chaos in my head straightened out. The use of icons and the time mechanic is perfect for me. And for some reason the layout doesn't make me feel silly putting the little daily routine things in along side daily activities and appointments, which for me is perfect. Hope this makes sense. Great job can't wait to see how it improves over time. 👍",
            "Couple bugs here and there (editing time slots of current events doesn't do anything) but as someone with ADHD, I love the concept and subscribed for a year. I like it on my WearOs watch, but I wish the main clockface could be changed or always-on. I BEG of you, however, to make a version for Samsung watches (Tizem OS).

Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder  focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary.\r\nAutism iHelp is an invaluable tool for your child with Autism when those first words just don’t come. The colorful real-life photos are presented in an easy-to-label format. \r\nThis app includes several features:\r\n24 real world photos; it has been proven that children with Autism respond best to photos as opposed to illustrations and are very visual learners.  \r\n\r\n•\t24 photos chosen based on established expressive language milestones are divided into three sub groups of eight.  With 24 photos, over-stimulation is less likely which increases the child’s ability to grasp the concepts at an appropriate rate.  \r\n\r\n•\tLabels of all photos with the option to turn off the label as some children with Autism may be more drawn to the written word. At the end of eight images there will be an option to try again, aiding in repetition and drill required for learning new words. \r\n\r\n•\tOption to have images presented at random or not,  to additionally aid in generalization and concrete learning.   \r\n\r\n•\tWhen audio is selected, two voice options are available—male and female.  This provides the most realistic experience for your child.  There will also be an option to turn the audio off, which would prompt your child to use his or her own voice and spontaneously label the learned words. \r\n\r\n•\tThis app also includes two Learning Enhancement activities.  These learning activities are presented in a game-like format, and require the child to either match a picture to word given multiple word choices or choose the word that goes with the picture in a field of 4 pictures.  These games check retention of the learned vocabulary and integrate auditory and visual memory.  Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\r\n\r\nAutism iHelp - Food app includes groups of fruits, vegetables, and everyday foods. Foods were chosen based on popularity among preschoolers, and healthy choices.

Приложение создавалось при помощи ведущего специалиста по прикладному анализу поведения – Юлии Михайловны Эрц.\r\n\r\nНовая версия, полностью сохранив функционал предыдущей, прибрела новые, уникальные возможности. Теперь родитель или специалист может использовать для общения с неговорящим ребенком не только стандартный набор карточек, но и сможет добавлять свои, создаваемые индивидуально. Такой функционал позволяет использовать приложение не только для неговорящих детей с аутизмом и другими нарушениями в развитии, но и для любых других людей, не имеющих возможности говорить. Это могут быть дети и взрослые с церебральным параличом, взрослые люди с последствиями травм и после инсульта, просто пожилые люди.\r\nНовая версия приложения создана при финансовой поддержке Фонда поддержки исторических и культурных исследований «Истоки».\r\n\r\n\r\nПриложение содержит:\r\n• Галерею карточек, содержащую более 150 качественных изображений, которые ребенок учится различать, наименовать и соотносить с различными категориями (например, животные, буквы, числа, формы, цвета и др). Умение различать и наименовать предметы также способствует развитию речевых навыков у детей с аутизмом и другими нарушениями в развитии. Родители и специалисты смогут добавлять свои карточки (фотографировать и озвучивать), используя в диалоге с ребенком те предметы и объекты, которые нужно изучить именно ему (папа, мама, поликлиника, детский садик и пр.)\r\n• Коммуникатор, при помощи которого ребенок может как просто обозначать желаемые предметы, так и составлять полноценные предложения-просьбы. Звуковое сопровождение позволяет ребенку озвучить собственные желания и дает возможность для повторения и речевой имитации. Разработанное с учетом многолетнего опыта специалистов центра реабилитации инвалидов детства «Наш Солнечный Мир» пособие подходит для эффективного обучения детей с аутизмом, синдромом Дауна, алалией и другими расстройствами, сопровождающимися трудностями в развитии речи. Приложение может быть использовано и в качестве развивающего пособия в процессе занятий с обычными детьми младшего возраста.\r\n• Специальный функционал приложения позволяет создавать коммуникативные, озвученные карточки для взрослых и пожилых людей с нарушениями речи.

Evident that careful thought, time, and effort was put into app by creators that they truly care about being helpful to parents and kids. Perhaps a subtitle option and tools for increasing attention span and involvement when not in learn together (at certain points characters prompt child to say something, hold an object on screen, when music stops do an activity, video transitions to a skill game, etc.)",
            "Although I have not used this app with children on the spectrum, as a former ABA therapist, I think the app is great! The app's pacing is brilliant for kid's on the spectrum. It downloads quickly and the learn together segments really encourages interactions with others. It is even has research backing. I think it is a good supplemental tool. Cool app!",

            "Bought it and after 15mins with the full version deleted and refund requested. I attempted to make my own schedule using photos I took myself while adding steps. Most wouldn't save :( Next I tried to change an image using one of the stock images, saved. That one kept reverting also. Recorded audio, but where does that play? Lastly, I couldn't rearrange the order of the steps for a schedule. 15 mins of trying and failing I realized I can probably do the same thing with PowerPoint.",
            "This app has potential. It is limited. Parents need access to pictures of a variety of individual task. You can upload your own picture which for some tasks like putting on shoes a child would recognize and maybe even relate better, howerever having the caricatures shoes would be more universally effective. If there were options and acess to unlimited art (different foods, clothes, places) for the variety of topics autism has. I would pay for it in a heartbeat. It has potential.",
            "Great at making visual social stories, adding photos and voice cues. Downfall is that you cant login and share your stories on multiple devices. I have installed on my phone for on the go use, and on my sons tablet for home use, but have to create stories twice as they dont sync together.",
            "Give 0 stars, limited to edit, useless for free version since not much you can do, good concept but since you very limited on fixing a schedule wouldn't even be worth a buy. Pretty much a waste of time and effort, practically useless, do yourself and download a diffrent app, can find better ones for free.",
            "Not happy with this app at all very limited even on the full version would not recommend requested a refund to the app developer waiting for a response"

It captures key lifestyle information like medication taken, different types of behaviors, and activity level - with the convenience of accessing and using it all in the palm of your hand at anywhere, anytime. All of the information that you collected can also be shared with trusted healthcare professionals and teachers so that the person you care for receives the best possible assistance and care.\r\n\r\nSOME OF OUR FEATURES FOR SIMPLIFYING CARE\r\n\r\nHere are five features you can look forward to: Profile, Diary, Goals, Sharing, Visualization. Each feature is connected to data, sharing, and monitoring a person’s well-being and health - in partnership with your autism community (therapists, physicians, teachers, parents, and more).\r\n\r\n(1) PROFILE\r\nProfiles are created and users can add important medical information like health conditions, name and location of medical professionals, and important locations like homes and schools. This information can be shared with other Chronaly users such as parents, therapists, and teachers.\r\n\r\n(2) DIARY\r\nValuable data and information is captured. Users can add events--snapshots of what has taken place in a person’s day-to-day life. Different types of events have unique inputs. For example, the sleep event would allow a parent to record how well their child slept, for how long, and how many times they woke up during their sleeping period. \r\n\r\n(3) GOALS\r\nGoals are created, tracked, and managed for better health and well-being.  Users can add goals for activity, behavior, toilet, health, and more.  One example is a therapist or parent can create a goal and add a time frame in which the goal is to be completed and the number of times that said goal needs to successfully done. Another example is if a parent wants to teach their child how to tie their shoes, they can add the date for when the goal needs to completed and how the number of successful attempts for the goal to be considered successful. \r\n\r\n(4) SHARING\r\nAll of the information that users include in the Chronaly app can be shared through the Profile feature with anyone who has a Chronaly account. This is an excellent way to share information with teachers, therapists, and physicians to make sure that they can provide the best care for your loved ones.\r\n\r\n(5) VISUALIZATION\r\nComing soon! Our visualization feature is driven by data and focused on putting data and insight in the palm of your hand. You can access and see metrics, reports, charts, illustrations of all captured behaviors, triggers, and indicators. This information is integrated with diary data to generate relevant analytics and progress transcripts. For example, a teacher can see how a student’s independent reading time has improved over the course of a semester, with data about genres that correlate with more focused reading or optimal reading length. \r\n\r\nLETS GET SOCIAL!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn for product updates and news.

Unfortunately I lost my magazine print copy when we moved yrs ago and i couldn't locate it online so i was super excited to see they had an app. I contacted the developer via text and email and got no response so finally Google was the one who refunded my 15.99$. Its a great magazine with good articles just wish they were doing a better job with this app!",

Esta ajuda pode ser através de apoios, como por exemplo, segurar nas mãos da pessoa com TEA por trás, como se você fosse um braço mecânico que a ajuda a fazer a atividade. O nível ou a quantidade de apoios utilizados depende de como a pessoa com TEA já consegue realizar a tarefa e, espera-se que com o tempo, a pessoa com TEA demonstre maior segurança ao realizar aqueles movimentos e seja possível ir reduzindo, aos poucos, a quantidade de apoio utilizado. Então, caso a pessoa com TEA demonstre que já consegue fazer algumas coisas sozinha, pode-se retirar gradualmente as dicas e apoios de acordo com o que a pessoa com TEA vai aprendendo a fazer os movimentos. Assim, ao invés de segurar nas mãos da pessoa com TEA para ajudá-la, segure em seus pulsos. Depois somente nos cotovelos, até que a ajuda necessária para que ela realize a tarefa com autonomia seja a menor possível. Vá dosando a retirada dos apoios, caso sinta que a pessoa com TEA regrediu, volte ao estágio anterior. Não estabeleça um tempo para que o aprendizado ocorra, cada ser humano é único e tem um tempo diferente de aprendizado.\r\n\r\nAntes de iniciar a atividade, pode-se fazer uma fase de preparação, mostrando todos os quadros da atividade, contando uma história de como vai ser a atividade, inclusive pode-se fazer essa fase já no ambiente onde será a ação. Após essa fase de preparação, pode-se chamar a pessoa com TEA para fazer a atividade realmente, fazendo o passo a passo como descrito a seguir.\r\n\r\nAo realizar o passo-a-passo das atividades junto com a pessoa com TEA, faça-a ter contato visual com o desenho do aplicativo, depois ajude-a a fazer aquele passo descrito no desenho, narrando de forma pausada, usando somente as palavras relacionadas à atividade e reforço positivo (recompensa, “parabéns”), evitando falar coisas que mudem o foco da atividade, como “fique quieto” ou “pare de pular”.\r\n\r\nAs atividades devem ser feitas todos os dias com o apoio das imagens do aplicativo e sempre que for fazer aquela atividade, recomenda-se que seja com o apoio do aplicativo. Por exemplo, se a pessoa com TEA está utilizando o apoio do aplicativo quando for lavar as mãos, sempre que ela for lavar as mãos ela irá esperar pelo apoio do aplicativo, por isso é importante manter a regularidade no uso do apoio visual.\r\n\r\nÉ importante ajudar a pessoa com TEA a se reconhecer no desenho, para isso você pode utilizar os desenhos para lhe narrar uma ‘historinha’, em que a pessoa com TEA é o personagem principal e realiza as ações descritas no quadro.\r\n\r\nTambém pode-se utilizar o apoio do desenho para ajudar a pessoa com TEA a interpretar a situação, fazendo-lhe perguntas (mesmo que ela seja não-verbal) como: “o que o personagem do desenho está fazendo?” “O que vem primeiro?” “Qual a ordem?”.\r\nSempre que a pessoa com TEA conseguir fazer uma atividade, deve-se lhe dar um ‘reforço positivo’, ou seja, fazê-la sentir que conquistou alguma coisa, que adquiriu um novo conhecimento.",

At least two changes are necessary, however,  for this to become a useful app. First, the behaviors need to be editable. Each individual has a unique set of behaviors. Second, there needs to be a way to export data. A .PNG file limits use and makes importing data into a spreadsheet very tedious. Please keep up the work as this app shows so much promise."

While you may see ads for books, or products that promise a cure for Autism, they are misleading you. Autism has no cure. There are lots of treatments that can make living with Autism easier.\r\nHere are some of the treatments that help with Autism.\r\n\r\nTherapies\r\n\r\nThere are several types of therapies that can help with the treatment of Autism. Occupational, physical, behavioral, speech, music, sensory, drug, play, and many other types of therapy can make a big difference in the life of an Autistic child. The therapies will not cure your child's Autism. They will just help teach them different ways of coping with it.\r\n\r\nAlternative Treatments\r\n\r\nNatural and alternative treatments are on the rise. These can include the use of herbs instead of prescription medications. The herbs do not have the side effects found in traditional medicines. Vitamin and mineral supplements are being found to help in treating Autism. Always notify the doctor of any natural products you are using with your child. Some herbs can have interactions with prescription medications. Remember again these herbs and vitamins are not cures. They are just to help with some of the symptoms of Autism.\r\n\r\nNutritional Methods\r\n\r\nSome people turn to the diet when treating Autism. They eliminate certain foods that could cause sensitivities. Some of the foods the remove from the diet are Gluten, dairy, and artificial dyes. The idea behind this method is that removing the foods that cause sensitivities will remove the behavior problems. You can have your child tested for food allergies. Ask your child's doctor about allergy testing. This will let you know if your child could be having behaviors due to a food allergy. It will also give you an idea of which foods to eliminate from their diet.\r\n\r\nThere is no cure for Autism, but there are lots of treatments that can help with some of the symptoms. When trying a new treatment only try one at a time. This will let you know if it is helping or not. Allow enough time for the treatment to work. Usually two or three months is enough time to tell if a new treatment is working. There will be no miracle treatments that give immediate results. If you are using a herbal or vitamin treatment inform the doctor. They need to be aware of the things you are trying. Herbs and vitamins can cause reactions with other medicines. It is important that the treatment team be kept informed and on the same page. This will make your child's outcome a more positive one.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not waste your money on products that claim to cure Autism. If there was a cure available it would be told to you by your doctor, instead of some guy on a late night infomercial. Continue to help your child by treating the symptoms of Autism.

            "This app is everything I never realized I needed!!! I am on the Autism spectrum, and my wife is too. We both go nonverbal sometimes. This makes it so much easier to communicate during those times. Wish I had this growing up!!! It's also fun to play with because we are immature lol. We made the male Google voice sound uncannily like Connor from Detroit: Become Human.",
            "This thing has saved my butt when anxiety shuts down my ability to talk. It's easy to modify, and it doesn't feel like an AAC device for special needs, with extraneous pictures. Simple, easy to use.",

            "Very supportive and responsive support. App has an easy to use UI for communication and seems to be quite customizable. The PIN function to restrict changes to settings is very useful. It does install all images locally but that also allows the app full functionality even when not connected to the internet. The app comes with multiple different page layouts on installation, and has the ability to create custom pages as well. However, I did have to explore myself the various settings and options available in the app, and how they changed the functionality and interface of the app. The degree of customization is great, such as custom buttons with personal images and sound recordings for true personalization of expression but these options can feel a little overwhelming for those that are unfamiliar with AAC apps or communication apps in general. Some sort of in app onboarding to help new users customize the app to their communication needs where new users can view the default page types/layouts easily when they first start the app, and a help/guide function or library explaining the different options available to users as far as customization and control goes would be very helpful. If there is a manual included in the application, it is not easily located. Otherwise, this app suits our needs perfectly, and I would definitely recommend this app.",
            "Wonderful speech app and incredible customer service. We've been using Proloquo2go for years and with each new version it is increasingly difficult to use, NO customer support in the US, and is so ridiculously expensive. Our school recommended TalkTablet and we are so much happier now. It has been a breath of fresh air. So much easier and more intuitive to use. No comparison. And the fellow we called at TalkTablet with some questions, before and after purchasing was outstanding 5*",
            "I am a community support worker who supports many people with speech difficulties of different types. This app is by far the best app in versatility, usability, and price. Customer support is the best that I've found, you accually get to talk to a real person if there are any questions which have been far and few in between do to the extreme user friendliness of this app. I can't say enough good things about the creater of this program, it has changed many people's lives.

            "My daughter has a learning disability and has no concept of time, this app helps her understand how long to wait until something is over or begins. We use it for calming time and also for when we are waiting to do an activity that we are really excited about. When we use the app it helps to remove the anticipatory anxiety & the constant questioning about when we are going to do that activity. Helps her understand concept of time, something the Dr is still convinced she won't be able to do.",
            "Very nice. I use this a lot with my 2 year old, she loves seeing if she can beat the timer. My only request would be for the image to stay up on the screen at the end of the timer until a button is pressed, because every so often she misses the ending. But the timer is a great way to get kids to understand time and to implement predictability for our kids, i.e. when we need to leave - I can tell her she has 5 or 10 more minutes to play and when the timer ends, we go home.",
            "This app is really good however there is too many ads and considering the target audience, children and children with disabilities, it really should be ad free.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I love the idea, but it feels unpolished. It regularly freezes, and has weird bugs. My child's morning routine is set by end time, but this morning it arbitrarily set the end time 5 minutes earlier. One day I logged on and a robotic voice said I had to read for 11 hours. There should also be a \"home\" or \"finish\" button at the end of a routine. Right now the routine end feels unresponsive and confusing. The price is too high for something that feels like a beta & I'd prefer a one time purchase.",
            "I'm an adult using this for her inner child, and it's great. I wish the app had an option for putting a task off of the routine, like if I'm late for work and can't do a few of the tasks or if I already did them earlier before I remembered to start the timer. That way it wouldn't compromise the integrity of the time tracking to just swipe left. Also, the voice informing you to spend more time on the task is incredibly annoying. But overall this is the best app for ADHD people I've ever seen.",
            "Some features are fantastic, but after using it for a few days, I went into my settings and it is showing this is only a free trial (which it does not say anywhere in the description or when you sign up.) I started using this app upon the recommendation of a friend; we both have kids with ADHD and my kid seems to love it so far! (Age 7) but she will be disappointed when the free trial runs out and we can't use it anymore. 😔 I would not have tried it if I was aware of that fact.",
            "The application is very good! Its amazing to find out, how simple things like this app helped me to stay on track.. It makes me even happier, to find out that the developer is working on the new version of the app, targeting adults. Brilli team, I thank you for your great job.",
            "I've been using this as an adult with ADHD and its been really helpful! Very much looking forward to an adults version in the future"

        "description": "ZOTTZ OT lets you create a fun, sensory environment using Z Occupational Therapy Toolz(R), patent pending, to test, and record a child's fine motor skill level. ZOTTZ is sensory feedback to captivate and motivate the Autistic mind. Fun OTs for TOTs.\r\n\r\nZOTTZ OT software lets you connect via Bluetooth to ZOTTZ - Z Occupational Therapy Toolz and then create timed tests for that the parent, therapist can use to test the level of success or needs the child may have.\r\n\r\nHow the software works:\r\n1. First connect via Blue tooth to ZOTTZ – Z Occupational Therapy Toolz.\r\n2. Enter the Name and Age of the Child you want to create an OT profile for. This is a baseline test for his or her fine motor skill test level.\r\n3. Then select the user you want to test fine motor skills – pencil gripping, pinching, button bilateral skills, scissors.\r\n4. You can select both the music and the led sensory feedback you want for the child.\r\nThis is very important. With this sensory selection you can provide the child with music and led  feedback they are motivated to use.\r\n5. ZOTTZ is a positive sensory feedback system, Fun OTs for TOTs.\r\n6. Then using Excel CSV data format the child's interactions are saved and then can be emailed to the parent/teacher/therapist.\r\nZOTTZ - FUN OTs for TOTs was created by an Autistic child and father team, and works because of the power of love that is at the core of all successful therapy programs.\r\n\r\nSo it will help you develop the feedback system that is best for the child, and let you test with ZOTTZ OT what the child can or cannot do. This way you can see what the child really needs, a brain-mapping of the Autistic child, and this is revolutionary.\r\nYour feedback is also appreciated as my Autistic son Zarrar and I want to help the disabled and challenged community to move forward, gain life skills, fine motor skills that are corner stone to a healthy, independent life.\r\nBrief description of ZOTTZ(tm) and the core of what it represents:\r\n\r\nZOTTZ is an occupational therapy tool focused on development of fundamental fine motor skills for Autistic and challenged children. Skills that ZOTTZ helps develop include holding pencils, picking up small objects like cheerios, cutting with scissors, pinching, buttoning. It helps a child develop finger strength, focus, and hand-eye coordination. These are critical tools for life.\r\n\r\nZOTTZ is a revolutionary tangible tech, reversing regression, a helping hand for challenged children. It works on a simple yet extremely effective principle: sensory integration and sensory feedback.\r\n\r\nZ Occupational Therapy Toolz has ambience, it sits on the table beckoning the child with LEDs flashing and soothing sounds to interact, to press PENCIL, PINCHER, BUTTONS and SCISSORS. And on performing the Occupational Therapy task the child is rewarded by sensory feedback: LEDs flashing, music playing. This motivates the child to press and play again and again, helping little fingers practice fine motor skills they would otherwise not be interested in performing.\r\n\r\nAs a Bluetooth device ZOTTZ communicates what the child is doing, and what Occupational Therapy tasks he or she can do and what they need to work on. By displaying this onscreen a parent, teacher or Occupational Therapist can better understand and guide the child to better hand skills, and bilateral coordination.",

        "description": "Talk To Me 100® Android and iPad app was developed by a speech and language pathologist as a way to use error-less communication (in which the learner never fails, but is supported in all communication attempts) to teach beginning language skills. This new voice output device helps parents, teachers and therapists  jump-start verbal expression for children who are struggling to communicate.\r\nTalk To Me 100® allows the learner to control their environment, and to signal the point of readiness to communicate.  Talk To Me 100® also provides immediate and consistent feedback, allows for practice and repetition of 100 frequently used words throughout daily activities, provides fun and enjoyment and lets the learner become accustomed to touch screen use.\r\nTalk To Me 100® is designed to provide communication partners with 100 words organized in a predictable format to use in an unlimited choice of daily activities. Sydspeak created this app for children with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, speech and language disorders and other special needs. Talk To Me 100® provides communication partners with a core vocabulary to begin verbal expression for all functions of language: imitate, comment, answer, question, describe, retell, accept, reject, repeat, command, request, explain, persuade, maintain social relationship and influence.\r\nThe adult communication partner models one or more words by selecting the buttons and using their natural voice to speak the same words  whether you are getting ready for school, eating dinner, reading or playing outside;  opportunities for verbal interaction are unlimited.\r\nTalk To Me 100® provides a beginning augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution for people who have difficulty speaking. Once the learner begins to combine 2-3 words spontaneously to communicate a new or novel  thought, they are well on their way to using more than 100 words, either using natural voice or using a more expanded and dynamic AAC device. \r\nThis app is a digital replica and companion to the original “child friendly” Talk To Me 100® available at www.sydspeak.com.  Priced at $59, this tablet is similar in size and comes in a durable plastic case with 3AAA  batteries. Research shows that when each communication partner uses their own personal  voice output device, language acquisition is more efficient.  For some children, a predictable pattern of images on a computer screen using the same child’s voice has more impact than pictures on paper with changing adult verbal  interactions.   For the first time, we now have a powerful communication system where both partners can have their own affordable and effective language device with the same voice and symbols. The free version offers a sample of beginning language learning.\r\nI recently evaluated a 3 year old child who was nonverbal. His parents said he only spoke 2 words: “mama” and “bye”. When presented with the Talk To Me 100®, he began exploring the board, pressing the symbols and listening to the words. I began using my version on the android app, and he immediately began imitating my words by pressing the symbols on his device. What sometimes takes months of therapy to achieve, he was imitating words within a few minutes!!!",

I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

For some children and adults, sound hypersensitivities are particularly problematic. Sounds from vacuum cleaners, thunder, crying babies, and other sources may cause extreme discomfort and distraction. adAPT – advanced auditory processing training is a music based system for guiding the brain to become a better processor of auditory information. \r\n\r\nHow does it work? \r\nDeveloped by a team of brain scientists, with funding from Cure Autism Now and the National Institutes of Health, adAPT is an educational program that involves listening to specially modulated music. The modulated music is believed to trigger neuroplasticity to re-organize a disordered auditory cortex into a better functioning system. In comparison to Berard Auditory Integration Training (a controversial alternative music based therapy), the music modulation profile for adAPT is explicitly based on over 15 years of neuroscience research by the team of scientists at CADET. Our study indicates that adAPT normalizes aberrant brain activity, reduces sound sensitivities, decreases irritability and behavior problems, and improves general auditory processing. Our on-going research includes the use of advanced brain imaging methods which is available through the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A white paper describing this research is available on our website (www.cadetnm.com). \r\n\r\nWhat is the adAPT program? \r\nadAPT is a 4-week, home-based program implemented as two 30-minute session per day for 5 days per week. Specially chosen music is included with the app (no additional purchase required), with modulation and playback completely automated within the app. The music modulation includes narrow and broadband filtering, plus insertion of everyday sounds for habituation. The music intentionally sounds a bit odd, with key characteristics to induce guided cortical re-organization. The whole program is automated, so just click play and follow the instructions in the app! \r\n\r\nHighlights: \r\n - For both kids (5+) and adults with sound hypersensitivities.  \r\n- Automated and home based: Use the app from the comfort of your home. There is no need for daily visits to a practitioner’s office.  \r\n- Specially chosen 96 kid-friendly songs are included with the app and no additional purchase within the app is required.\r\n- Unlike most other music educational programs for reducing sound hyper-sensitivities, adAPT is explicitly founded on neuroscientific concepts and data. \r\n\r\n\r\nTerms of Service: http://www.cadetnm.com/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.cadetnm.com/privacy",

        "description": "Dialogo AAC is the innovative Android application that provides an intuitive, simple and functional development environment for creating tables, structures and communication books, aimed to people with difficulties in verbal language, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Dialogo system is to improve the life quality of people with this type of disease that, due to frustration caused by an inability to understand and be understood, can lead to problem behaviors.\r\nFor this reason Dialogo AAC integrates better than ever, the Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), a system that uses writing, symbols, images, instruments and gestures that would outweigh the difficulties of communication.\r\n\r\nThe application comes with a package of PACS (Pictures Animated Communication Symbols), which in addition to several classic symbols include animated images, designed to attract the attention of a user and help him understand the meaning of the figure that he is selecting.\r\n\r\nDialogo AAC, with its completeness and ease customization, is also a powerful tool aimed at all those people who suffer from neurodegenerative disorders that limit temporarily or permanently, the expressive language and / or mobility (AL, SMA etc.) using interfaces for accessibility such as sensors, Eyetracking, touch-screen and movie face.\r\nSo you can turn your Android tablet into a complete and amazing device  for communicate.\r\n\r\nBasic functionality:\r\n\r\n- Creating structures simplified thanks to a visual mode of links: each grid is displayed on the left and all the grids ad'essa connected to the right, so you always have to hand the conceptual schema that is being achieved. During the creation, you can also create links directly from their cells to the grids, new or selected from those already created.\r\n\r\n- Creating grids fully customizable: choose the number of rows and columns, the background, the layout and the number of cells, the actions that it perform when it’s visualized.\r\n\r\n-Customization of each cell: you can choose its shape, its style, its content, and the actions it can perform (to choose from more than 50 commands) when that cell is selected by the user.

COREAT es la adaptación española del Repetitive Behavior Scale – Revised (RBS-R) un instrumento que ha mostrado excelentes propiedades psicométricas en estudios internacionales y en población española para el diagnóstico diferencial del TEA. Con esta aplicación podrá obtener el nivel de severidad de los síntomas: estereotipados, autolesivos, compulsivos, de similitud, ritualísticos y restrictivos. La información proporcionada tras realizar el test será de gran utilidad tanto para el profesional (obtención de percentiles para redacción de informes), como para los familiares que pueden visualizar la gravedad de los síntomas en unas gráficas sencillas.  \r\n\r\nNota importante:\r\nSi al realizar el test NO APARECE EL GRÁFICO es porque se ha dejado alguna pregunta sin contestar. Por lo tanto, se recomienda revisar el cuestionario durante su proceso. Este cuestionario no permite incluir datos personales. Los datos generales aportados serán totalmente anónimos. Del mismo modo, los datos numéricos obtenidos no se quedarán almacenados en ninguna base de datos para la investigación. Por último, esta aplicación no genera informes ni un diagnóstico clínico definitivo.\r\n\r\nComité de ética:\r\nLa investigación que ha permitido obtener los baremos de este instrumento de evaluación fue aprobada por el Comité de Ética de la Investigación de la Universidad de Alicante (España).\r\n\r\nDirector del proyecto:\r\nDr. Agustín Ernesto Martínez González.

        "descriptionHTML": "El app Conducta Repetitiva Autismo Test (COREAT) se trata de un test que mide el nivel de severidad de la conducta repetitiva tanto en personas con Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA) como en personas con Discapacidad Intelectual (DI). COREAT es la adaptación española del Repetitive Behavior Scale – Revised (RBS-R) un instrumento que ha mostrado excelentes propiedades psicométricas en estudios internacionales y en población española para el diagnóstico diferencial del TEA. Con esta aplicación podrá obtener el nivel de severidad de los síntomas: estereotipados, autolesivos, compulsivos, de similitud, ritualísticos y restrictivos. La información proporcionada tras realizar el test será de gran utilidad tanto para el profesional (obtención de percentiles para redacción de informes), como para los familiares que pueden visualizar la gravedad de los síntomas en unas gráficas sencillas.  <br><br>Nota importante:<br>Si al realizar el test NO APARECE EL GRÁFICO es porque se ha dejado alguna pregunta sin contestar. Por lo tanto, se recomienda revisar el cuestionario durante su proceso. Este cuestionario no permite incluir datos personales. Los datos generales aportados serán totalmente anónimos. Del mismo modo, los datos numéricos obtenidos no se quedarán almacenados en ninguna base de datos para la investigación. Por último, esta aplicación no genera informes ni un diagnóstico clínico definitivo.<br><br>Comité de ética:<br>La investigación que ha permitido obtener los baremos de este instrumento de evaluación fue aprobada por el Comité de Ética de la Investigación de la Universidad de Alicante (España).<br><br>Director del proyecto:<br>Dr. Agustín Ernesto Martínez González.

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

        "description": "Have fun learning how facial expressions reveal what people are feeling!\r\n\r\nLearn with Rufus: Feelings and Emotions aims to help children learn the facial expressions that correspond to feelings and emotions including happy, sad, angry, afraid, disgusted, and surprised. Children will learn how to identify easier fully-formed emotions and more difficult subtle emotions. The game is highly customizable to meet the needs of children with varying skills, ability levels, and learning styles.\r\n\r\nThis game was designed by Dr Holly Gastgeb, a clinical and developmental psychologist with over ten years of experience working with typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Her research has shown that children with ASD have difficulty identifying emotions from an early age. Since this ability is developed throughout childhood, the game is beneficial for a wide range of children including early achievers without any diagnosed learning difficulties.\r\n\r\nLearn with Rufus: Feelings and Emotions is organized into a learning phase and two games:\r\n• Learning - A preview of the facial expressions is shown to the child before the game starts.\r\n• Find It! - Shown a number of facial expressions, the child is directed to select a specific emotion.\r\n• Name It! - Shown a single facial expression, the child is asked to name the emotion.\r\n\r\nTo keep children interested and motivated, the following features are included:\r\n• Reward sets - Choose from nine different colorful child-friendly reward sets including bugs, cars, cats, and more.\r\n• Toy break - The child is given periodic breaks with fun on-screen fingerpainting. This feature can be turned off if the child does not need breaks or finds them distracting.\r\n• Positive reinforcement - Rufus does a \"happy dance\" and gives positive verbal reinforcement when the child answers correctly. If the child answers incorrectly, the correct answer is restated.\r\n• Music and sounds - Child-friendly music and sounds are included. This feature can be turned off if the child is sensitive to or distracted by sounds and music.\r\n• Text - The word that corresponds to each picture is presented above the picture. This feature can be turned off if the words are distracting to the child.\r\n• Emoticons - Emoticons that correspond to the emotions are presented. This feature can be turned off to increase difficulty.\r\n\r\nAdditional customizable features that are present include:\r\n• Level of difficulty - The level of difficulty can be adjusted to match the child's ability level:\r\nEasy - Facial expressions with quickly identifiable emotions\r\nMedium - Facial expressions with a mix of slightly less identifiable emotions\r\nHard - Facial expressions with partially formed emotions\r\nExpert - Facial expressions with subtle emotions\r\n• Training - The practice session before the games may be disabled to increase difficulty.\r\n• Group Size - Choose from a group size for the game phase depending on the child's ability level. Group size can be 2 or 4 for Find It! and group size can be 2, 4, or 6 for Name It!\r\n• Languages - Choose from English and Spanish.\r\n\r\nFor parents, educators, and therapists:\r\n• Profiles per child - More than one child can play the game and all data is stored under each child's name.\r\n• Track data and statistics - At the end of the game, a graph of the child's data is presented. Touch the graph to enlarge it, then touch each data point to gather information about the child's performance. If the device is capable of email, select the Export button to send a CSV file of the data.\r\n\r\nFor Ages 4 & Up",

            "Useless. GPS tracking does not work, tried everything, app usually gets stuck on loading, the features are not user friendly, very limited, very clunky. It's a really slow, limited and badly designed app with inadequate features .",
            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",
            "I'm not very happy that Norton does not provide coverage for Microsoft Explorer. Also if you add a website to the unblocked list they are not unblocked immediately. They have a few kinks to work out for me."

        "comments": [
            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

This App helps unlock your strengths and identifies challenges to your personal growth, offering advice and guidance that can help you be the best you can be, as well as gaining insights into any problem areas. Neurodiversity App is the first app worldwide that screens for neurodiversity and identifies strengths and challenges and provides practical suggestions to help you to be the best you can.\r\n \r\nWhat does this strength and challenge screening app do?\r\nThe ND App is a screener that processes your information to produce a personalised skill-set report. ND App uses state of the art research and latest technology to ‎help identify your strengths and challenges in these areas - Cognitive skills, Emotion, Feelings, Organising, Time Management, Speaking, Listening, Literacy, Numeracy and Motor Skills. The highly informative report can provide a discussion point with those who support you, including family, managers and educational support. Revolutionary technology developed by internationally recognised cognitive and learning specialists creates your report identifying key areas that may require attention.\r\n\r\nWho can ND App help?\r\nThe app, questions and reports are designed for anyone over 16 years of age who wants to understand themselves better and thinks they maybe neurodiverse or already been diagnosed having one or more conditions but wants a better understanding of themselves overall.\r\n\r\nIs ND App accessible?\r\nYes. ND App is at the forefront of accessible technology enabling questions and reports to be read out aloud. You can also change colours and fonts. It has not been specifically designed for those with visual and hearing impairment as the responses may alter because of specific challenges. This may need to be considered when completing the tool if you do have a visual or hearing impairment.\r\n\r\nHow can ND App help me?\r\nIt can help you to start to understand your strengths and challenges, be they are home, work or in education. The report can be emailed to you, identifies key areas that may require some attention and provides practical tips to help. Although designed as a screener, it may provide a starting point for discussions such as managers, in education or your family. It may help you to consider if having a full diagnostic assessment would be worthwhile. \r\n\r\nIs there lots of reading to do?\r\nThe questions and the onscreen report can be read out to you using your phone text-to-speech.\r\n\r\nWhat areas does it look at?\r\nYou may have come across terms such as neurodiversity, a positive term that describes people who have a varying cognitive profile. Conditions under this umbrella term include: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC), Dyscalculia, Dyslexia, Developmental Language Disorders and Developmental Co-ordination Disorder (also known as Dyspraxia). There is a lot of terminology out there, and the focus is to identify specific areas of challenge as well as looking at what you are good at. However, from work we have done in the past ten years the report indicates traits in the areas of:\r\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\r\nAutism Spectrum Conditions (ASC)\r\nDyscalculia\r\nDyslexia\r\nDevelopmental Language Disorders\r\nDevelopmental Co-ordination Disorder (also known as Dyspraxia or DCD)\r\n\r\n*Note:  This should not be seen as a diagnostic tool.",

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

            "The game is great. My problem is that I had a glitch where I couldn't complete a game.I matched everything but no win. I sent a message and told them and mentioned that I lost 300 coins playing this game 3 times. They fixed it, but I guess they don't reimburse for their glitches. 2nd thing, now they have a survey going. 200 coins. I could use it. Takes 15 minutes. It finally says thanks you you now have the 200 coins. Well I didn't get it. Tried again. No coins. Asked for help twice. Nada",
            "Love this game, however since yesterday on every game I play, once I've cleared the board completely I have to use one of my help options to end the round. Not sure if this is a glitch or what. I hope this gets fixed, or I will need to stop playing and delete. I am updating my review, the previous has been fixed and now my game back to working as normal. I really appreciate the fast turnaround on this. Other than that, this game is fun, and relaxing... love it.",
            "It is fun, some stages more challenging than others. Sometimes items get stuck and you need to use a cheat to get them quick enough not to lose your bonus. Only thing is, there's a piggy bank that's full that you can't use for anything but you can unlock a bigger piggy bank but why??? There's no purpose to it??? I would love the ability to do a shared board with a friend.",
            "I like the game but like others I have issues: 1) ads which can't be muted. I don't care for the political ads, wish to mute. 2) Items on the sides being hard to grasp, agree. I started using a stylus. Easier. 3) I still have no idea what the coins are for as most things in the game cost money, not coins; I'm not sure why the amount of coins reset either, what's the point? I haven't reached the level some have mentioned where there are \"ghost\" pieces though. That'll likely change my rating.",
            "Originally I gave this game 5 stars. I have cancelled that because I now only get times in the 5 minute range. Gets very boring now. Same time continually. What happened? Also agree about too many adds. Not enough time given to actually playing the game. More time spent waiting for ads to go by. I never watch them. Fixed the 'same time' problem. Deleted game for a while. Then downloaded it again. Did this a couple of times until the times changed. OK for now anyway. Problem Ads the same."

I understand trying to keep the game updated and fresh; but to screw over existing players is not cool. And though I use Wi-Fi, I find it takes forever to get in and at times find myself getting stuck when it's uploading to the next game play.",
            "The game has never been so laggy, it stutters and freeze like never before. There are invisible players spawnkilling everyone, and there's a really annoying bug on the first spawn of every match; I always have to wait for someone to kill me so I can spawn and go help my team. And now, the Sniper Scopes (6x and 8x) shakes way too much, making it impossible for snipers to stabilize their aim right on the target without getting too vulnerable, please, fix this.",
            "Its so GD laggy, before update 6.0 the gameplay network connection flow was almost seamless but now players are shooting me behind GD fuxking walls because hotboxes and whereas my character actually is are delayed and nowhere near in smooth synchronization between the two...please address this network connectivity issue as it makes this and or any game absolutely dreadfully painful to enjoyably play! I've spent so many hours and so much money in support of the development because I've faith...",
            "The newest update brings pay to win significantly, added profile picture fixed stuck on prime choice and its good The bad: is my time to render the game is now very slow my character hasnt rendered completely and it decreases framrate it will he covered when u play the match for a while -Stuck on uncancelable matchmaking -cant start the match making only showed pls wait and it happend contiously as long as i press the \"battle\" botton to start the game",
            "Since the new update came out it's been taking about 10 mins to search for rooms and then 10 more mins to actually start playing; when it finally loads the match is already half way done. Its unfair how these apps for free users theres no care for them at all unless you spending money. I need this issue resolved with the taking forever to load and search for rooms."

So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse 😑 we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please 🙏 fix your game 😔"

Zebrainy is an educational game where you can find all sorts of learning games for kids, no matter how old they are.\r\n\r\nZebrainy will help you to develop kids’ memory, reading skills, matching abilities, concentration, and creativity. It is not a simple ABC game for toddlers; you will find 1st-grade math material, shapes and colors vocabulary, drawing and coloring tasks, “English A-Z”, where each letter has a short cartoon with new words every time.\r\n\r\nOur team consists of professional teachers, scientific consultants, composers, and very talented artists. All these people go the extra mile when it comes to quality.\r\n\r\nGet your toddler ready for school! With ABC games, it will be much easier for your child to learn the alphabet and start reading than in tedious preschool lessons! The colors used in the app develop their imagination, perception, and attention. It's a fun learning game for boys and girls both! If your child is 5-6-7 years old, already knows numbers and letters, pre-school and kindergarten are over, don't worry! The app can still come in handy!  Math and reading are essential not only in the 1st grade, and it is highly recommended to revise the information with a child from time to time. \r\n\r\nWhat the difference between Zebrainy and other educational games for kids?\r\n- It helps your baby to fall in love with drawing, reading\r\n- In just 2 month toddlers will know shapes and colors\r\n- It takes just nine months for your kid to complete the full course preparation for school (you can start in kindergarten or even earlier)\r\n- It is easier to communicate with a kid after using the app\r\n- Multiple coloring tasks will improve your toddler’s imagination\r\n- The app doesn’t separate games for boys and girls \r\n\r\nThe main advantages of Zebrainy: \r\n- It takes into account your child's abilities, gender, age and flexibility of mind\r\n- Kids get awards and a collection of artifacts \r\n- At the end of the day, kids can watch educational cartoons \r\n- In the menu, parents can check the achievements of their children\r\n\r\nThe list of skills except for preschool learning:\r\n- The ability to set and achieve goals\r\n- Navigating in a strange environment,\r\n- Making decisions quickly\r\n- Communicating with others and making connections\r\n- Analyzing different information, and coming to the right conclusions \r\n- It is an educational challenge, so your kid will never get bored\r\n\r\nWhich features differ Zebrainy from the others?\r\n- Artificial intelligence creates a unique program for kids and toddlers due to their activity and age\r\n- Alphabet learning (composing each letter with round elements help develop fine motor skills and visual memory)\r\n- Cartoons and interactive educational processes make it more than simply an ABC game for kids. It answers different needs in every stage of growth.\r\n\r\nSince this is a toddler learning game, it can be used if your baby is 1, 2, or 3 years old,  and it is also a great educational app for preschoolers 4-6 years old, and even 7-year-old first graders! It is a scientific fact that kids perceive everything from birth. So all the commands in the game eventually will form a base for further successful education. We guarantee that your baby will be learning safely and at the correct level.\r\n \r\nYou can send any questions or suggestions to support@zebrainy.com\r\n \r\nPrivacy and Access Policy:\r\nhttp://zebrainy.com/privacy-policy/\r\nhttp://zebrainy.com/terms-of-service/",

But tonight at past 7pm, i was automatically charged for the 3months payment..My gcash fund was deducted. How come when in fact ive got a notification that i already cancelled the subscription. Please refund my payment as I cancelled within the day. Thanks.",

            "Honestly no idea why- but ive been experiencing so many problems with recent updates. Ive been working on this edit and all the transitions are extremely buggy- they won't even transition smoothly, it just cuts off. At first i didn't mind it because it wasn't too noticeable. But now its every single transition that won't come out smooth. Literally trying to do anything on this app either crashes the whole app or just messes up transitions.",
            "It had been working fine just the videos came out laggy all the time. Today i had spent an hour working on a video and the app just closed, everytime i went back in it would ask if i would like to continue editing and i clicked resume but then it would just close again. After a few times didnt even give the option to resume anymore and now i basically lost an hour of my life because of bugs.",
            "So I loved this app and I still do but there is one problem. I had this app signed into my old phone so when I got my new phone I tried so many times to log in but it keeps saying \"Account already registered\" So I have to be as a guest but I really wanna go on funimate as my account. Please help me log back into funimate.",
            "Honestly, super good! It's given me quite inspiration to do more things! The effects, filters are nice, and so is just everything in all. The reason I gave a star off, though, is because of the \"Locked\" items that can only be given through following FM on different platforms, but all in all a good software!",
            "My experience was just horrible I had to buy pro to get my edit which I spent hours on. If it would only come to that why wouldn't yall mention that in the beginning? I never got my edit and it took a lot of time to make. I'm upset. I'm never using this app again nor am I recommending it to anyone. Thank you have a good day. I hope this problem can be fixed."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "I really enjoyed this app it's actually really cool! Now that it was Holloween I tried it... Yes it is neat. The only issue is that you can use the app just to see if you like it and it will give you a lot of options but I didn't like that if you didn't purchase this app... You get cut off and you cut off your potential customers to early I understand that you're goal is to make money off your app.Im not sure about the purchase I don't know what more it has to offer just get cut off .",
            "When signing up for monthly pro, the app tells you your first 3 days are free and \"at the end of the 3 day trial period an auto-renewable subscription will be activated automatically.\" This is a lie! There is no free trial; you will be charged immediately! Luckily I disputed the charges with Google and got my money back, but beware y'all, there is no free trial, regardless of what my screenshot of the app clearly says.",
            "This is an awesome app! There are two paid option that are reasonable and so worth it. With so many cool options and features that are available to try for free you will definitely stay busy and will want to the paid version and the more you share the smarter the app gets so you can't go wrong. I Definitely recommend this app.",
            "Luv 💗. I use this app all the time. I love it. The only thing id say it needs to improve on is the fact that there are not many options that work for group photos. Most onky work for selfies",
            "I dropped off the one star and reduced it to zero. The devs responded about getting the 1 year option and everything was wrong. Here's what you have to do: cancel your subscription and wait for a little bit. You will then have MANY places where they nag you to go PRO and from there you can choose either subscription option. You cannot do like the dev said. This is sure a lot more trouble than it's worth. UNINSTALLED! ---ORIGINAL review: I'm giving this ONE star because of their business model. Like other's, the first thing I saw was an offer of 3 day free trial with $4.99 PER MONTH after, plus another offer (that I can no longer find) for $9.99 per year. I might go for the yearly option except for the fact that everything they do seems shady. There are NO options and that includes no way within the app to tell it not to send notifications. I immediately was targeted with a notification and after a few of those, I had to go into the phone's notification settings to block them. They constantly nag me to share my pictures on their web site so they can have free use of my creations which they make it VERY difficult to remove what you shared and changed your mind. The online website provides NO options to delete your shares. Somewhere, I saw a recommendation for this app but it didn't give a clue about how expensive it was (even on the App Store, there is little to warn you). You find this out right away when you first run it. Positive note: the app itself is very fun and very addictive. It's all internet based functions, very little is actually on the phone taking up your memory. If you have weak internet or poor signal, this will be frustrating slow. If I can't find the overpriced $9.99 per year option, I'm not continuing this grossly overpriced monthly subscription. It's fun, but not THAT fun. With the lack of information and options, I am suspect of this company's motives. There is so much wrong with this company and it's functions it's kind of scary."

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",

DO NOT INSTALL. if you don't believe me and other people experience it yourself.",
            "Sooo many fake accounts(robots)(Bots)(AI)(Artificial Intelligence). Too many people using the same exact message. Nobody says anything real. For what it's worth the app feels nice and the programmer should be proud of their own craftsmanship.",
            "Its a good app just needs to improve more and they should think of some advantages for the senders as the senders invest huge amounts in the app",
            "Do not download. The layout is confusing, invasive, and refuses to respond through their customer service email when they have no option to permanently delete unless you want to link Facebook, google, and your phone number. I didn't read the reviews and tried on a whim. Seriously, don't install it. If there were such a thing as negative stars or turds, this app deserve the lot of those. Has anyone successfully deleted their account from there?",
            "Tiktok is BY FAR better. I spent 4 hours trying to figure out this app, and customer service did NOT help. The app DOES have potential, but the problem right now is, there needs to be an entire rescripting of the English version of this app. User guidelines are vague and not well written. FAQ does not hold enough information. The 24-7 customer service bot is all AI and there is no actual person, unless they give you an email.. which I am still waiting for.. App is fun, but still needs work."

            "The entire game is a \"pay to win\" nightmare... It is designed to artificially limit your progress in as many ways as you can think of. You cant upgrade your units without \"shards\" which are completely random. Worse, there is also an insultingly low \"daily gold limit.\" Gold is also required to make any upgrades. Worse, if you try to fight without leveling up, you will actually LOSE all of your hard earned progress. THE ONLY WAY TO WIN THIS GAME, IS TO NEVER PLAY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!",
            "Normally I don't like these types of games (auto battlers), but this is actually the first one that I've enjoyed. The game has quite a bit of strategy to it and oozes quality. The monetization system is questionable of course, it's pay-to-win and that is why I will not spend any money on it (I would happily have had the game as a premium title instead) and the game will get old quite fast for me because of that. But for now it is quite fun.",
            "Its a expensive game and you will not win if you never pay that why i notice. The winning rate will totally drop and you will done nothing once you stop spending. Gain no experience as well when loosing in the season pass. They will give just a star for wagon which will take 4 to 8 hours. You will enjoy playing at first but will loose interest in the long run",
            "Great game, I've been playing for a couple of months now without spending a cent. Quite playable without paying, although progess is slow after reaching certain level. Good variety of units but simple enough to relax and enjoy. Also you choose if you want to watch adds for resources. My only complaint is that, lacking resources, it is difficult to upgrade units, and therefore change strategies, once you are at a certian level. But overall a great game!",
            "Update fail. Game now crashes immediately after the 1st splash screen. Anyway it's just a cash grab. The now rampamt \"battle pass\" last barely a week & doesnt grant enogu to be worth buying even if it lasted a month or more like most others do. No real strategy, just whoever buys the most, wins & no real game as combat is entirely automated."

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

Using easy to understand instructions and eye-catching animation children move through tasks commonly practiced in therapy sessions. \r\n\r\nReports are provided for the parent to monitor progress and maintain records. Want to show developmental activities as part of your homeschool records? No problem!

This is a great way to practice attention and instruction following in a colorful manor that’s full of movement! Watch out!

Trace (with stroke guidance) your numbers, count the animals, and watch them leap into our fun train! This is the foundation of the number and math skills we will strengthen with more fun to come!\r\n\r\n\r\nTracing Letters: Now it’s time to work on your letters! Just like before, you get to trace!

            "A good strategy game, not too mechanically complex and decently challenging. A treat for fans of the series. Most of the negative reviews are people upset about being able to buy things. Look, all free games want your money. But FEH is pretty generous with what you get for free, has no ads, is from a trusted name, and no game mode is behind a pay wall. You can build up a deep bench of heroes and be competitive in PVP modes and never spend a single dollar.",
            "FEH is unfortunately plagued by many issues. If you're like me, and play for the characters you love, you won't have fun. I've spent hundreds of hours (and real money) collecting and upgrading my favorites, just for them to be outclassed by whatever new OP 5* of the week gets released. You have to pull a character 11 times to max out their power, ridiculous. It's all up to luck if you get the characters you want, and even if you do they'll probably suck. Play Three Houses instead.",
            "I love this game, and there is a ton of stuff to do in it. The amount of free orbs (the real money currency) you get seems to be decent. While I have some minor balancing issues with the game, the main reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the limit on inventory. There are 580 characters; why do we only get 300 slots before having to spend orbs? This has not changed since the launch of the game as far as I'm aware. I feel like we should have free slots equal to the # of different units",
            "As someone who spent 2 thousand on this game, i feel qualified to say: I cant believe advanced wars died to this franchise. Power creep. Bloated summoning pool. Terrible features. Predatory mechanics to spend money. If you like this stuff, then this is the game for you. Dont speak to me ever again, intelligent systems. Hit me with a generic automated response and ill hit ya with a KleanYoSelf",
            "Very fun and rewarding. Purchases are not needed for good characters but I do it anyway because the prices are actually reasonable. Edit: I was actually getting a new player new character summon boost I wasn't aware of back then. It is a little hard to get the characters you want without spending money, and sometimes even still so with spending, but if you are a Fire Emblem fan, it is still a very fun, challenging, and rewarding game."

            "DON'T PLAY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! It would be a nice game but unless your willing to spend money your not going to get anywhere. Its ridiculously difficult to get any 💎's to move along in the game. I couldn't even get past creating my character because I didn't have enough 💎's. And watching a bunch of ads to try and get gems no thanks.",
            "The app is good for casual play, I usually have a couple of books going at the one time to build up diamonds. The only criticism is things cost too much diamonds and sometimes the videos for free keys and diamonds don't work.",
            "For how expensive this game is, you would think that they would update their stories. It has been two months since some of the stories received a new chapter. Choices are normally 20+ gems EACH and you're not even given that many through the free options they keep mentioning. It will take days to reach that amount using the free gem options. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor and saving yourself a load of disappointment, frustration and regret.",
            "Fun game, but it's completely ridiculous just how expensive it is. You need a TON of diamonds to play, and there is no way of collecting nearly enough for free. You need to buy and even with that, they go so quickly it's not worth it. It's not a choice game when there are 2 options and the one you want costs you at least 20 diamonds, almost every single time. Clothing changes also cost 20 to 25 diamonds. I would be willing to pay a reasonable monthly unlimited amount to play, but this is insane.",

            "After reading a few of the reviews, I was nervous about trying to update. Happy to say I had absolutely NO problem. I used to have problems with many updates until I realized that my VPN was working too well, lol. (Even with \"safe\" sites. Nord can suck and I'm sorry I paid for 3 years in advance to get a good deal, or I'd have dumped it ages ago!) I never know what update is going to be stopped until it is, so if you're having trouble and have a VPN, try pausing it then try again.",
            "I'm always a little hesitant about updating this update after reading the reviews each time. It seems this update always seems to be tied to an update with Chrome. I have not had any issues with updating to this latest version. It is concerning, when there seems to be no feedback from the development team, who put out these updates. I hope someone is making them aware, of all the difficulties people are running into. Someone on their end should always monitor, after an update is available.",
            "It's awful and won't update, and because of, google chrome won't update!!! Fix it!!!!... C'mon!!! Stop giving us updates that don't work!! And because of it, google chrome will also not update!!! Said before, FIX IT!! or stop doing updates!! And yes, I've tried possible fixes that others have stated, still no! Herd we are again, one week later and this app won't update thus chrome won't update!! Fix ur crappy software or better stop the updates since they don't work anyway!",
            "nearly every weboage opened using this. When scrolling down, freezes and \"shakes\" on Android 11/ pixel 3xl Would love to delete it. But I've got years of saved content in it. Which for some reason known only to the Google gods. Does not save in the full version of chrome. Why? If I save a site in webview, aka bookmark it. Why doesn't it save in chrome too. Doing so would eliminate more of the infamous Google duplicity. We could eliminate this app or chrome. Which are technically the same",
            "I can't even download the most recent update, despite trying for several days. Reading the other recent reviews, I see that maybe it's good I've got an old version. Not good, cause it's still been buggy as hell, but, better (maybe)? What's going on? I use Android so this is affecting my other apps badly."
