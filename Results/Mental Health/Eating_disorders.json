            "Forced to pay before service and before reviewing therapist. The rates shared for comparison are wrong, a regular therapy for me was 50 euros per session, NOT 150-200 as mentioned. No way to choose the therapist, they're matched with you, which is a way for them to ensure more money to be paid... Not better than Better Help...",
            "\"The only way this app is lesser to \"\"regular\"\" therapy is the element of human touch because sometimes a handshake or pat on the back is so helpful. But the app does everything else just like a regular therapist does - you can use video or phone calls if you want more of a \"\"real\"\" feeling and if youre a little shy you can stick to texting and it works just fine\"",
            "My path to recovery has been a long one and it's not easy. It's hard for me to afford a therapist and basically as a last resort I went online to try and find some help because I felt on the verge of a relapse… I got so lucky to find this app. It's still not cheap, but a lot more sensible than a regular therapist and always accessible... I'm lucky.",
            "At first I didn't realize that every one of the therapists on this app are real counselors with real credentials and they are licensed by the state - this isn't some nice support ground it's actual psychological therapy and that means it's just the most incredible value for money compared to regular therapy",
            "As someone who can't afford therapy, I was looking for self help methids and this app promised an 8 step program, everything was going good until I get a notification from the app saying: Fighting it alone is nearly impossible. Tall to your licensed therapist. Seriously guys? Thank you for making me lose hope!!!"

            "I love that this teaches mindful, intuitive eating and not dieting/ restricting. It really helps me to slow down and listen to my body. I am very impressed with this app! I also love the meditations 🧘‍♀️",
            "I was looking for an app where I could track macros but not calories. I end up restricting and getting too obsessive. This doesn't track macros but I couldn't care less. It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",

            "This app has some really good tools. However, I am not sure that all of the quotes used would be that helpful for someone struggling. One that I am directly referencing states something about critizim blocking the person from changing. Also, this app has not been updated in a long time because it keeps triggering a message on my phone saying that it was made for an older version of android and may not opperate correctly.",
            "So far a good app but I hope it'll be updated at some point, 5 years is a long time to go without any updates.",
            "I really like this app as it's been helping me keep myself accountable for my eating. it is rather personalisable, however I would very much like to be able to add \"emotions\" in the log meal section, and I also have to mention that my notifications have stopped working, which is honestly a shame because now I sometimes forget to use the app. except for these two points, the app is really great!",
            "I'm feeling the benefit of using this app after just one week. I am always enticed by the control of logging all of my calories in diet apps, but this just makes my disorder worse. Rise Up offers a very helpful solution where you can log your meals manually and with no expectations. I think this helps me feel accountable to myself. Just taking this small action gives me some hope for improving my situation. As well as this feature are many journalling tasks which I've found a good way to focus my mind on non ED patterns. The app does not have a polished feel yet, and the motivational pictures after I log a meal seem rather generic. These are the only slight negatives.",
            "Good app but some of the quotes are really unhealthy. 'you will not be punished for your anger you will be punished by your anger'. That's encouraging an unhealthy relationship with anger. Also the feedback email they give on the app doesn't work"

They either don't play or when they play, they overtake the screen on landscape mode and I can't close them out nor move to the next step. I was super excited about this app and I really hope fixes come out soon, but for now I can't really use it which is a shame.",
            "*Update* customer service reached out to this review rapidly and explained the technical difficulty and that it was fixed. I was able to register right away upon trying again. So far, this app is everything i had hoped for! *original review* Downloaded the app. When I go to register an account, it gives a little pop up that just says \"Whoops!\" with no explanation of why it won't let me create an account.",
            "Initially loved this app and found it really helpful. Couldn't log anything retrospectively, which the developers were unable to help with. The new update just gave it loads of bugs, videos stopped playing and the app crashed whenever I tried answer questions. Ended up uninstalling, which was a shame as it started off so well. I hope they fix it soon for future users.",
            "I really like the app, but too glitchy. I went to re-watch a video, and then I selected to view and add in order to watch it. But every single time it just freezes up my screen and then I have to uninstall the app. Still can't watch the previous videos that I missed.",
            "Hey all I loved this app until day 37. It won't allow me to watch any new videos from the library even though I'm on day 43. Also when I play the videos they are echo-ey? The videos freeze if I play them once I enter the app, the audio continues but the visual does not. I end up having to restart the program and then it works fine."

        "description": "Bulimia among men and women is on the rise. With body image in our culture being on the forefront of our minds, it is no surprise that not people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Bulimia Nervosa Help Calendar can help you put an end to your bulimia addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your bulimia nervosa.\r\n \r\nFeatures:\r\n1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.\r\n2. Create your own reasons to quit bulimia, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.\r\n3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.\r\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop bulimia.\r\n5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.\r\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success.\r\n7. Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of bulimia and introduce you to something more positive and soothing.\r\n8. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone in this process to shake bulimia.\r\n \r\nBulimia is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with this condition binge eat. They then take steps to avoid weight gain. Most commonly, this means vomiting (purging). But it can also mean excessive exercising or fasting. Treatments include counseling, medications, and nutrition education.\r\n \r\nHere are our top 8 reasons to say no to bulimia:\r\n \r\n1. Stop feeling isolated from others\r\n \r\nIt is not easy to explain to others why you have to go to the bathroom and throw up after a meal. Bulimia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being Bulimic, you experience emotional and physical pain.\r\n \r\n2. Malnutrition is a big issue\r\n \r\nMalnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of Bulimia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.\r\n \r\n3. Bulimic dehydration\r\n \r\nMild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.\r\n \r\n4. Bulimia makes you lose hair\r\n \r\nThe lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out.\r\n \r\n5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body\r\n \r\nYour body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.\r\n \r\n6. Bulimia makes your fingernails brittle\r\n \r\nThis goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body. Your fingernails are not an essential part of your body when you are not getting enough nutrients, so your body will shut down the flow of nutrients to your nails.\r\n \r\n7. You could become infertile!\r\n \r\nBody fat is essential for menstruation. Not only will you lose your ability to become pregnant, but you will also stop having your period. Some may see this as a perk, but extended periods of this will lead to permanent infertility.\r\n \r\n8. Bone loss\r\n \r\nWith Bulimia, bones become more brittle because of the lack of nutrient delivery. This will lead to having weaker bones and increase the chances of your bones breaking.\r\n\r\n \r\nIf you are having trouble with bulimia or being bulimic, simply download Bulimia Nervosa Help Calendar for FREE and get help now!",

Yesterday I used my other app (recovery path) by the same developers to let them know about the issue but have yet to hear anything back from them. I was really looking forward to using these two apps together as a way of replacing my bad habit with a good one but am quickly getting discouraged. I hope this server issue can be fixed quickly so I can update my review to 5 stars.",
            "Amazing app. I've tried a few food journal apps but this is so personal and motivational. I love how it allows you to log your thoughts, why u ate, ur feelings and exercise logs. Oh, it is just such a cute app.",
            "I love this app because it's well-rounded - I can track my low-FODMAP progression as well as my emotions, make notes of what was affecting me, my IBS symptoms, link up with not only my dietician but my other medical doctors. I use it mostly as my diary but a different one to search for low-FODMAP foods. Haven't used it yet, but I look forward to try the learn section to quiz myself.",
            "I enjoyed using this app on my last tablet but since updating to a new tablet, I have been having trouble logging in, a message saying can't connect to nurishly server, please fix this problem as the app is a really good one",
            "Great app, has helped me change my habits. One thing that's annoying is that it always shows one day ahead of the day it is when I go to check what my plan is for the day. I've tried clearing the cache and it's still not working right."

        "description": "The Skinny On Anorexia\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of mass media’s rising campaign on beauty products and weight-loss products, people have been given the idea that they need to be appearance-conscious to get noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with a lot of skinny celebrities and models in the media spotlight, it gives people a misconception that being skinny is synonymous to being beautiful. And because of this misconception that a lot of women become obsessed in losing weight, by any means necessary, be it naturally or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alarming emergence in eating disorders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEating disorders have become increasingly prevalent in western countries because of a drastic change in the feminine body ideal towards thinness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn estimated five to ten percent of girls and women, an approximated five to ten million people, and a million boys and men suffer from eating disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong these eating disorders are anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, and other dietary conditions. An estimated fifteen percent of young women adopt unhealthy eating habits and behaviours about food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnorexia Nervosa\r\n\r\nAnorexia is the second most common eating disorder. Anorexia and bulimia nervosa are common in terms of having an intense fear of becoming fat or even just to be perceived as fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever anorexia differs in the sense that anorexic people starve themselves to lose weight, on the other hand people with bulimia eat to their hearts content and then purge by forcing themselves to vomit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnorexia and other eating disorders usually start during early adolescence. People with anorexia nervosa often do a good job at hiding their eating disorder until the side effects have become prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd anorexic people also have a tendency to deny that something is wrong with them, that they’re already finished eating, or that they’re not hungry at the moment. They also keep insisting that they need to lose more weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnorexia and other eating disorders may have stemmed from a misunderstanding of a wide range of social influences that dictate for women to be skinny and imitate supermodel looks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr sometimes it may be self-inflicted as a way of refusing to enter puberty. Some experts relate having low self-esteem, loneliness, a history of abuse, peer pressure, inferiority complex, and perfectionism as triggers of such conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSide effects\r\n\r\nSide effects are mainly classified into psychological, social and physical. Physical side effects may come as a result from lack of nutrition from very little food intake, this may put serious strain on a lot of the body’s major organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnorexia may also cause psychological side effects, changing the way a person thinks, giving anorexics a distorted view on things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical side effects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFatigue and loss of energy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHypotension (low blood pressure)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDizziness due to low blood pressure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFine hair growth on body (lanugo hair)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHair loss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPins and needles (parathesia due to changes in the peripheral changes in the nervous system)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrittle nails and fragile bones due to low calcium\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreased vulnerability to osteoporosis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnaemia and pale skin due to low iron levels\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEasy bruising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCramps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUlcers \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusceptibility to cold due to loss of insulation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdema (tissue swelling from water) due to electrolyte imbalances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCessation of menstruation \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrain on most of the bodies organs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThyroid dysfunction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrregularity in the secretion of growth hormone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential kidney failure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUrinary tract infections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic indigestion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential liver failure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOsteoporosis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological side effects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLow self esteem and loss of confidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeelings of being ineffective and powerless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFear of losing control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMood swings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrritability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxiety and depression\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoneliness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeelings of being worthless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that you understand what anorexia is all about, it will be easier to look out for tell-tale signs of the disease.",

Finally, we became concerned due to numerous challenges that made our patients feel that their rights as per HIPAA were being violated. The most disturbing part of our experience with RR was that the \"troubleshooting team\" was slow and in fact rude when we tried to help communicate with them about their issues with their own app - I would expect a business owner to be grateful to hear feedback about their app. Jenna, the CEO, is clearly overwhelmed as is her team, and it appears she was not prepared to handle volume when she created this app."

        "description": "Anorexia among men and women is on the rise. With body image in our culture being on the forefront of our minds, it is no surprise that not people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Anorexia Nervosa Help Calendar can help you put an end to your anorexia addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your anorexia nervosa.\r\n \r\nFeatures:\r\n1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.\r\n2. Create your own reasons to quit anorexia, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.\r\n3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.\r\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop anorexia.\r\n5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.\r\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success.\r\n7. Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of anorexia and introduce you to something more positive and soothing.\r\n8. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake anorexia.\r\n \r\nAnorexia is characterized by a distorted body image, with an unwarranted fear of being overweight. Symptoms include trying to maintain a below-normal weight through starvation or too much exercise. Medical treatment may be needed to restore normal weight. Download this free app to help you overcome. \r\n \r\nHere are our top 8 reasons to say no to anorexia:\r\n \r\n1. Stop feeling isolated from others\r\n \r\nIt is not easy to explain to others why you aren’t eating. Anorexia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being anorexic, you experience emotional and physical pain.\r\n \r\n2. Malnutrition is a big issue\r\n \r\nMalnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of anorexia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.\r\n \r\n3. Anorexic dehydration\r\n \r\nMild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.\r\n \r\n4. Anorexia makes you lose hair\r\n \r\nThe lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out. \r\n \r\n5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body\r\n \r\nYour body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.\r\n \r\n6. Anorexia makes your fingernails brittle\r\n \r\nThis goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body. Your fingernails are not an essential part of your body when you are not getting enough nutrients, so your body will shut down the flow of nutrients to your nails.\r\n \r\n7. You could become infertile!\r\n \r\nBody fat is essential for menstruation. Not only will you lose your ability to become pregnant, but you will also stop having your period. Some may see this as a perk, but extended periods of this will lead to permanent infertility. \r\n \r\n8. Bone loss\r\n \r\nWith anorexia, bones become more brittle because of the lack of nutrient delivery. This will lead to having weaker bones and increase the chances of your bones breaking. \r\n \r\n \r\nDownload Anorexia Nervosa Help Calendar now for FREE and help get rid of anorexia once and for all!",

Symptoms include trying to maintain a below-normal weight through starvation or too much exercise. Medical treatment may be needed to restore normal weight. Download this free app to help you overcome. <br> <br>Here are our top 8 reasons to say no to anorexia:<br> <br>1. Stop feeling isolated from others<br> <br>It is not easy to explain to others why you aren’t eating. Anorexia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being anorexic, you experience emotional and physical pain.<br> <br>2. Malnutrition is a big issue<br> <br>Malnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of anorexia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.<br> <br>3. Anorexic dehydration<br> <br>Mild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.<br> <br>4. Anorexia makes you lose hair<br> <br>The lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out. <br> <br>5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body<br> <br>Your body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.<br> <br>6. Anorexia makes your fingernails brittle<br> <br>This goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body. Your fingernails are not an essential part of your body when you are not getting enough nutrients, so your body will shut down the flow of nutrients to your nails.<br> <br>7. You could become infertile!<br> <br>Body fat is essential for menstruation. Not only will you lose your ability to become pregnant, but you will also stop having your period. Some may see this as a perk, but extended periods of this will lead to permanent infertility. <br> <br>8. Bone loss<br> <br>With anorexia, bones become more brittle because of the lack of nutrient delivery. This will lead to having weaker bones and increase the chances of your bones breaking. <br> <br> <br>Download Anorexia Nervosa Help Calendar now for FREE and help get rid of anorexia once and for all!",

Its a very useful and helpful app tool. It'll give you a more a positive view of yourself and of your mental state. A hugh thankyou to the creators, especially for allowing it free",

            "I like how every area of this app is straight forward; even the questionnaire is direct and effective. There are SEVERAL DIFFERENT topics to êxplore! The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",
            "I have shared it with friends already. It's great. Retake tests compare the results to each one. Keeps a journal. Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

You can go to a meeting every hour. Not to mention that this app has a daily check-in as well as the option to record your triggers and cravings and you can keep note and a daily motivational affirmation picture oh and you can create your own affirmations put your own pictures behind it",
            "Have tried multiple recovery apps but this one is the best by a long shot. It's phenomenal! With the ability to record my feelings, any cravings, thoughts, and so much more, and share them all with my family and other support I feel like I'll finally be able to overcome my addiction. I'm not one for calling my support team but this app allows for them to comment on a log entry, message me 1-on-1, or send group messages. I highly recommend this app!",
            "This is really the BEST app I have ever used! It's better than i even hoped for, really. I have tried almost 30 other, I can't even say similar, apps but they are no contest! this has everything available all the time any time for any reason! you need to talk to somebody, or to find a meeting, or if you want to read resources or reach out to other people going through the same thing you are, this is the perfect app! I love it! Life changing amazing! thank you for creating it!",
            "Have not had this app very long but what I have got from this app so far i give 5 stars i love everything about this app when I tell me self oh I can do a certain part of my daily program which has been set outside of this app, it seems to fall right on time that this app reminds me that it's time to check in with myself and my recovery and this app prompts me to check in with a heck of a lot more than what I would normally ( but should be doing normally) so its a god send for me"

Are you afraid to gain weight and therefore you avoid meals? You might be suffering from Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa (or simply known as anorexia) is an eating disorder causing a severe weight loss. More than physical, it is a mental condition. The main symptoms of anorexia are fatigue, insomnia, low body weight, pale skin, hair loss, brittle nails, depression, dry skin, constipation, low blood pressure, chronic fatigue, frequent mood swings, avoiding social gatherings, etc. The biggest problem with the treatment of anorexia is that it is really difficult to diagnose and should not be confused with bulimia, a similar but distinct condition. And, it can cause serious physical disorders such as bone weight loss, anemia, imbalance of electrolytes in the body, kidney problems, etc., if it is not cured timely. It would be wise to consult a doctor and psychologists to treat this condition. However, some of the natural remedies can also be helpful to cure anorexia.",

            "The idea behind this app of 'renewing your mind' when considering food is slowly working for me. It might be a slow process but I figure it is correcting 35+ years of thoughts. The app is simple to use and I would recommend it to anyone. As a bonus it also deals with other thought processes such as dealing with stress etc. So doesn't have to be just a weight loss solution.",
            "When I pull the app up and read, it changes my focus. It helps me rid myself of \"wrong thinking\" and get my mind back onto truth. Having my mind focused on the right things enables me to live by God's truth instead my \"feelings.\" Thank you Barb.",
            "I have had this app for over a year and just started using it consistently. I struggle with many lies surrounding eating and have found it very helpful in changing the way I see food. I have to be vigilant though as whenever I think I am all \"fixed\" I find myself slipping back in to old habits and need to run back to this and my Lord. There are no easy fixes.",
            "This works so so well, for all temptations!!!! It's the fastest reference I've found, to access powerful, super Bible verses that empower change, even immediate change. Not only on food issues but for ANY temptations we need strength against. Emotions, ungodly thinking, procrastination, bitterness, etc etc! This app gets you right to the love and healing power of God, in a really efficient way. Perfect tool to \"renew\" our minds (Romans 12:2) for when temptation creeps in. Give it a look!",
            "Phenomenal. Great title, great content, super helpful!! One nitpicky recommendation would be to add the \"as you read these verses...think...\" before the verses as opposed to after."

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "I had this app years ago and it worked really well. Downloaded it last week and it seems to be a lot more troublesome now. When I take a photo the screen freezes for 10 seconds before it acknowledges it. For my diary yesterday (Monday) it is saying it is today (Tuesday) instead. Also some of the days have timestamps of when I ate the meal yet other days show when my reminder is set. The clocks changed at the weekend but the app hasn't aligned with that, as my phone now buzzes at the wrong time.",
            "Good app. Does what I need. But sometimes......usually after about 4 weeks it plays up to the point where I have to uninstall and download again.",
            "Easy to use and supports tracking food without numbers. And by default set up to encourage eating 6x a day, which is great. But the number of ads for premium services is a lot -- I can't ever just log my food without closing an ad. Sometimes meal updates and edits don't reflect in the daily view until later. And now I can't move to the next day without a blocking ad. Please fix these things -- I would happily recommend this app to everybody I know if it weren't for them.",
            "I wish this app worked. It's a great idea. I'm running the latest version of Android on a Pixel phone and the app still has errors. The PDF function doesn't work. When I click the today function it takes me to the wrong day. Super frustrating.",

Please add kg loss progress for tracking or make another app with it and exercise daily habit and I will download instantly.",

            "I'm LOVING this app! I set it to make a sound every 20 seconds between bites, and it made me realize how fast I normally eat. I ended up eating less as I got full with fewer bites (Apparently it takes time for the feeling of fullness to manifest) and I enjoyed the food MORE as I was able to actually savor the food itself rather than shoveling it in. Much easier than counting the seconds in between bites in your head lol. Thanks so much for making this app!",

I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills.

If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",

        "description": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! \r\n\r\nYou can use My OA Toolkit's Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nYou can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! \r\n\r\nPersonally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What’s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... \r\n\r\nIt also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you've abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.\r\n\r\nFEATURES: \r\n\r\n• Food Journal / Diary \r\n\r\nIn addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.\r\n\r\nYou could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.\r\nAs a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.\r\n\r\nThere are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.\r\n\r\nAlthough individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan — no matter how flexible or structured — is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA's Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.\r\nSource:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html\r\n\r\n\r\n• Gratitude List \r\nIf you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  \r\n\r\n* Hardship Discounts Available \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:\r\n1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.\r\n2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.\r\n\r\nSpiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.\r\n\r\n * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What’s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>• Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan — no matter how flexible or structured — is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>• Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

As a Programmer myself, I would have to say that this has been built very well and so far I haven't experienced any hiccups or software issues with the app. My only gripe, and this is just because I'm frugal, is the pricing of the Premium version. 4.99 just seems a lot to me to unlock basic customization options.",
            "This is the best of the quitting habit trackers I've tried. Nice simple yet classy UI, & adding motivational cards helps remember why I'm doing this. I have used it for ages so upgraded to premium for extra goals. I also like the dark theme. The only thing I would have liked in premium was maybe an added diary or notes, though I still think it was well worth my money.",
            "I expected a bit more features and options, but it's rather good. Good and easy UI, everything is clear and easy, cold figure out fast how it works. Edit: although it was logged in with Google Play, it did not back up my progress, lost everything.",
            "Awesome app!! Put off paying for the upgrade for a while but was worth it. What I like most is the calculation of time and money spent or saved...keeps me recording my slip ups and makes it so much more than just a clock. The calendar view is also really cool",
            "Really helps. In the past I've tried to quit smoking and bought a little $1 cigar to 'tide me over'... I always ended up returning to smoking. But I didn't this time because I didn't want to reset my progress. It really helps to see it. One week, no smokes for me!"

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

            "This app is simple to use and to the point. The ads are also not invasive or distracting. Overall this app is A great way to keep track. However, it would be great if there was a feature to view a snapshot of what the user inputs for the week and/or month. How it is now, the user must click on each day to see what was previously input on the calendar And that is a bit annoying.",
            "I really like this app--it's easy to use, and I love many of thr features. The only thing I don't like (and I dislike enough to not give 5 stars) is that there is no category option for \"dessert,\" but there is a tag for \"junk.\" I want to be able to log my after-dinner chocolate with a label that describes what it is (not a \"snack\" or just \"food\"), but the lack of option other than \"junk\" feels annoyingly diet culture-y and shaming. That one flaw aside, this app is very good and suits my needs",
            "Great + easy to use. Would be nice to edit some of the categories mainly on the drink names as there is things I don't drink, such as energy drinks. Otherwise a good app, like that I can export the CSV to Google sheets and it's quick to add entries.",
            "Simple but effective. I was looking for something in which to record the meals that I was eating so that I could be more conscious about what I was eating. I wasn't interested in counting calories but I was interested in eating less. This works perfectly, though I do wish it populated a list of my prior meals in a drop-down rather than do the incremental search that it does.",
            "At the very beginning i thought what kind of journal doesnt keep track of days Pryor days was about to delete. I have since figured it out. Not only does it track food and water it as few other helpful things to track exercise, meds, supplements and a other other button. I will find this app to be very useful. I would have however been happy with a little tutorial."

It might not be an error that shows up on Google Play Store, but it shows up in my app manager and it's annoying. I also noticed at least one spelling mistake within the app, even while only reading through the very first section, about Accute Stress Disorder (ASD).",

Also agree with another reviewer that a calendar view for jumping to specific days would be nice.",

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",
            "Paid premium, and didn't recieve. Sending questions and suggestions via email, and Facebook. No answer because they are closed on weekends. This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

            "This test was very accurate, as long as your honest. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I did the test and I had three. I would suggest anyone that might want to know to do this test.",
            "Upon a search of \"disorder\", within the top 10 results I see 3 \"psycnet\" apps, of which one of them is #1 result. While the information is good, (atleast the offline content), it is regurgitated from other sources. The layout of each app is identical, however the icon images on download screen seem \"too\" unique, thereby concealing the relationship until further examination. Its a tad creepy, considering the online \"tests\" and information stored from within the apps.",
            "I've been diagnosed,beginning at a young age,with mental health disorders.Although I enjoy taking online tests such as this,for the most part the results are not indicative of my diagnosis.THIS PARTICULAR SCREENING TEST was extremely accurate, so much so that my first thought(I found myself lmao)was I could have saved innumerable visits and time if only 30 years ago this app had been available for me to stumbled upon. Absolutely \"On Point\"Terrific job devs. Check it out,thank me later, lol.",
            "The test knew exactly what I have. I'm a psych student and I have a personality disorder, so I thought I'd see if the app would guess right. I answered honestly and found myself thinking that because I'm medicated and so mentally healthy right now it wouldn't pick up on it. But when I got to the end, that BPD bar was the only blip and it was sticking straight out. So unless everyone else also got BPD, I'd say this is pretty realistic. Still, I wouldn't rely on this for a diagnosis."

            "This app is wonderful, I struggle with binge eating and this has helped a lot. Thanks for making this app!",
            "I really like some aspects of this app. The guidance for mindful eating is \ngreat for example. However I was disappointed in the section that advises \nyou when you need help making food choices. I expected this section to \nguide me through making choices based on what my body needs, but instead it \ngives choices of different 'healthy' snacks that I may or may not have in \nthe fridge and that I might not even like. I want to learn to make my own \nfood choices in a healthy, intuitive and mindful way, not pick from a list \nof what someone else thinks I should eat.",
            "I am super pleased with this app. It is intuitively organized and provides support that helps me identify and \"feed\" my truest need when I am not physically hungry. I was also looking for something to bring me into my body in a mindful way to assist with intuitive eating when I AM hungry. This app provides that as well, and using it is quick and easy. Thank you!",
            "This app is brilliant I am happy I now have a tool to help me recognise how \nI feel and if I'm hungry or eating emotionally",
            "This is so easy to use. When I find myself eating out of habit or emotional discomfort, I just push the app and it guides me to a better frame of mind. It's amazing how effortlessly it puts me back in the driver's seat."

            "Seeing progress in a statistical format gives it a bit more foundation to my mind. Numbers can be viewed as 12345 and there is no way to reinterpret \"1\" or \"2\" or \"3\", no matter what what our experience has conditioned us to BELIEVE or what varied cultures teach us, in any language \"1\" means \"1\". SO, I progress \"1\" day at a time!",
            "Most of the time I feel the app has everything as I need. It would be better if the graph in stats be improved. Currently I have mesrly 200+ entries and it is impossible to track my progress with it as the data points are too cramped to conclude any meaning ful information from it. Further, there is scope to add some more insightful representation under this section. Thanks you.",
            "I really love this app! The daily quotes are AMAZING and the fact you can track your sobriety from multiple addictions is exactly what i was looking for. I also really like the goals that you can attain/keep track of since each step feels like an accomplishment. Pay the 2.99 to unlock the entire app as well! You won't regret it!",
            "I thing being able to see the hours and minutes pass was therapeutic, especially the first week which is huge. Just having the reminders and the pats on the back. We don't get enough of that. I guess only reason it's not a 5 is there's not a whole lot to do, but it's free so..."

            "It is really simple to use and let's you add all the info you want to. Which most apps don't. However, one thing that is a bit Irish is the drinks and snack sections. Seeing as the snack section has the water and coffee in it, And that's it!!! (No squash, juice, tea...) I presume the drinks section is for alcohol?!? It doesn't really make sense. Either the snack section is for snacks and the drink section for drinks or add a drink tick chart in each section. With breakfast, lunch, dinner...",
            "Simple entry food diary, not for tracking calories. Good for people who eat out and have drinks and want to keep track of those things. I like it just for the purpose of remembering what I consume and being able to look back on the day to reflect on what I need to add to or omit from my diet.",
            "Great app if you want something very simple and clean to log your meals on. No calorie counting. No portions to enter. No searching a database to find the right food.... just type it in and go. Its exactly what I needed to help me log and commit my meals for bright line eating on the go.",
            "Nice and simple... I usually make mine into bullets for easier review (simple enough to do oneself), but I'd love if there were a way to either review or download each day of logs. The app works perfectly for my purposes right now, but if working with a nutritionist or something, being able to send the info for a day, a week, etc would be a huge assist, even if it were just some kind of full-day review screen that I could screen shot. Otherwise, no complaints, aside from the annoying adds😉",
            "I love it! It's so simple. Other apps count down your calories and that makes for anxiety. This just allows you to write anything you want in the notes field. Some days I track veggies, others calories, still others protein. It's so simple and this, so versatile."

            "I Love This App!!! It's been a month, and so far I'm down 10 pounds ... almost effortlessly!! The most exciting part however is that for the first time in a long time I don't feel out of control with my eating and weight gain. I have felt powerless for such a long time as my weight kept creeping up and up and having no clue how to stop it, let alone reverse it! It is almost surreal to feel so calm and at ease around food. I can't recommend this app, or this support group, enough! 😊❤",
            "Amazing results, was honestly dubious when I first downloaded the app but have been surprised how wrong I was. Only on week 7 of VGB and have already lost 2 stone without feeling deprived of anything. The only thing I feel needs to be slightly changed is to put more emphasis on the exercise side within the later hypnosis sessions as I feel this has slipped slightly once moving on to session 3 and 4",
            "It's a good app but I'm having problems. Do you have the redownload the hypnosis sessions every night? I often can't actually download them as the download button isn't always there. I've checked WiFi signal and everything there is ok. Is it just me having this issue?",
            "A fantastic app that really does work. I'm now on week 7 and 19lbs lighter and lost over 5 inches of both hips and waist. As it's not a diet, I don't feel deprived of anything I like to eat but have naturally stopped choosing unhealthy food which I never believed possible until now!!! Well worth trying!!",
            "Amazing app. I started listening and following the guidelines 5 weeks ago, and I've since lost 10kg/21lbs. And it's been easy and enjoyable. I highly recommend doing the weeks free trial, you've nothing to lose and everything to gain. After that, the monthly payment seems a very small amount to pay for what you get out if it."

The notifications can be set at a time when you know the app will be most effective (when you are usually hungry) and the activity itself is simple and effective. It feels like a very zen way to train your mind to achieve a healthier body.",

I'm not controlled by cravings and binge eating or by calorie counting and then self loathing.

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

Said after spending 10+ hours of near continual usage on the app. Further, in that time the mods/admins were active in discussing community issues, and pending changes in an open posting. Refreshing, and grateful that I stumbled across TalkLife. Keep it secret, keep it safe. ;)",
            "Few things annoy me about it (full page ads every so often, not non stop though but they are hard to exit out of), can't quickly scroll to the top of a page and can't set unique backgrounds for a post. All in all though, a good, helpful app!",
            "I'm using this app for 5 months and it helped me in a lot way, like making friends, taking care of my mental health and helping people. And the new update is so cool. Especially the groups we can moderate our own group and publicize it. So happy to see a community growing and being a part of it.",

            "Great overall! I'm working on eating more regularly and this app is what I'm using to transition away from fully logging every meal. Adding each item and seeing how many or what colors I'm lacking is fun and definitely inspires me to eat more and different plant based foods than I usually do (I struggle with purple, for example, so it's helped me try new ones in that category). I just wish various plant based milks (almond, coconut, etc) were listed, or that you could add your own food items.",
            "I've been using myfitnesspal to track nutrients, but ended up using it in a harmful way, focusing way more on calories than on quality of food. So I switched to this, and I love it so far, really helpful for creating a healthier mindset towards healthy foods and what they can provide. Thank you fue this!",
            "A little slow to get started, but smoother once you have a few 'favorites' logged. Fun way to get kids excited about trying new fruits and veggies. Great tool for adults, too!",
            "Really good app. It's a bit slow and clunky to add foods though. It would be lovely to see some features like being able to quickly add common foods, or see recent foods first in the search, or to multi-add foods. Edit: The update is amazing! The new feature is super handy! Thank you for considering my idea 🤩",

            "Noom puts the \"fun\" in \"functional\" plus it's easy to use! This app has short, informative articles that always make me chuckle. I lost weight right away during the 14-day trial, now I'm signed up for the next three months! This isn't like any other wellness app... you gotta try it for yourself to see just what I love about Noom. Totally worth it!!",
            "Originally thought I was getting my money's worth. But now they removed their built-in pedometer (which is the only device/app I was using) and they also removed the GPS tracking for when you do a workout and you want to know the distance you went (walk, hike, bike, etc). Very disappointed. I can't even accurately track my exercice anymore with this latest update they did! How am I supposed to figure out the distance I just hiked in order to punch it in manually? Ridiculous update.",
            "I absolutely love Noom! I've never had so much fun and success loosing weight! I love the tracking calories and seeing how many I have left, all the information they give you every day and the fun way they explain it, the coach, the group interaction! This is for me. I'm going to sign up my daughter too. I've only lost 9 pounds so far, but I know I'll stick with it and loose the rest ( unlike other diets) because I'm really enjoying it and learning so much. I love Noom!",
            "I absolutely love this! You learn how to eat better, and eat less. Noom helps you to be accountable for everything from nutrition to fitness! It is also motivational and you have a personal coach to help you along the way. You set realistic long term and short term goals for yourself. One thing that surprised me was I've always been a healthy eater, but with noom I realized I was eating way too dense. So far Ive lost 5 lbs and its the first week! If you put in the work, youll see results!",
            "So far mostly ok. Two main complaints: 1. Step tracking. Originally I set it up to sync with Fitbit and adjust goals daily, but it wasn't working so I tried to remove the link to Fitbit but now it only lets me choose a different app. I just want to log steps manually. 2. Why do they have you add on a meal plan and exercise plan but NOT have those integrated into the app? If I'd known in advance these would be just emailed to me and not really part of the program I wouldn't have gotten them."

            "I am using the paid version and I love it! I love the reminders and the lessons. I especially love the recipes and the fact that you have a TON of vegetarian options. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that recipes get removed! I plan my meals a week in advance and I went today to prepare one and the 3 of the recipes are gone! There also isn't an option to download a .pdf to save for later. Please fix this and i will rate 5 stars!",
            "Great app. I've experimented with IF in the past, with great success. However, with COVID and working from home, it's a lot easier to slip up and eat whenever you want to. This app pops up periodically reminding me that I need to drink water. It's nice to have a reminder, which should prevent me from mindlessly eating when I'm not scheduled to. My first foray into IF was about 2 years ago, and I lost 85lbs in total. I'm not quite where I was before, but I'm still dealing with about 50 extra lbs. This app is highly recommended, as long as you use it as intended.",
            "Great app, takes a little learning. I was initially confused by the words encouraging me to 'End Fasting' when I was only hours into current fast. This resulted in a few badly timed fast records, but the ability to edit fasting start and end times saved me. I often forget to record my water intake, despite the much appreciated reminders from the app. The retroactive edit ability for water intake does not allow me to click on a day and edit. No response when I try to select a day's water record.",
            "Easy and Convenient app. I love that I can see my progress so easily!! I wish I could connect to my community though. It disappeared as quickly as it appeared???? I also wish I could communicate with my fasting buddies, at minimum send them an emoji or something. I use the paid version so I'm not sure what I'm getting that's any different than the free version... I don't use the recipes or the tools, I just use the trackers. All in all I'm happy I have the app though to stay on track.",
            "Love this app. I'm using the free version. There are enough features to get you started on IF. You enter basic info about yourself & they suggest a plan. You can modify the IF hours. Cool feature shows start/stop times. During fast you can see at a glance how long you've fasted/and time left. Reminders to drink water w/place to log amount. Didn't rate 5 stars because I wear an off brand fitness tracker (not listed on app) so steps are not recorded & no way to manually enter steps taken."

            "I've had a great experience with this app! The food is delicious and easy to cook. I absolutely love the shopping list feature. One thing I would really like is for an actual breakdown of how many grams of food each person should eat. For example, it tells me that I should eat 44% of the food, but we usually use a bit more ingredients than the recipe calls for (ie., Using 2lbs of meat instead of 1.75 lbs). Having an actual weight for the nutrition breakdown would be immensely helpful.",
            "I like this app but it needs some work to make it more user friendly. Like once you make a dish from your weekly menu you should be able to check it off. I love the shopping list and pantry feature, but how about letting me add stuff to the shopping list so that I don't have to have two lists?",
            "So far I am super impressed I am on an elimination diet and suspected to be sensitive to garlic. I listed garlic and garlic salt as an ingredient to avoid. My first experience with the suggested meals at Whole Foods, the kielbasa and substitutes all had garlic salt. I had to put back the ingredients for that meal when I canceled it. I lost time but I also saved a lot of time with the shopping list feature, It's amazing! Please consider integrating with Lose it!",
            "The layout and concept of the meal plans is great. However I accidentally created a meal plan and it won't let me delete it. I can only create a new one but then the ingredients are based off the previous meal plan that was created by accident and I can't reset it. I would contact support but they don't offer in app support?",
            "this is a great plan, for me personally. love the recipes, qiuck, easy and oh ao tasty. I don't stick to it like the bible, but use it as a tool to fit my lifestyle and it helps keep me on track. I'm down a total of 25 lbs in a yr 1/2 . it's definitely a lifestyle change. I totally recommend! Thanks Christine and coaches!"

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

The emotions don't match with the correct day, the time of the entries show only the time you downloaded the report and it doesn't include any of the recorded cognitive dysfunctions I logged. I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",

This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

The time of day is just as important as the date itself and a pretty standard question providers ask when asking patients about their symptoms. I have to keep a time and date log while wearing a heart monitor so they can correlate the two but I don't see how to do that. I will be requesting a refund.",
            "The app is quite good but you need to add more functions and more details, add stuff that would keep your customers motivated to use it. E.g if you use the app and enter data you have an animal that grows as you enter data every day. Once that animal grows you get another animal or plant or a garden or something that you'd care for while caring for yourself.",

            "after playing with the app a bit more I'm going to have to pause in my use. I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

        "description": "The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\r\n\r\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\r\n\r\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

Only issue I have is that to retrieve my saved readings, I have to save the current daily reading before my saved readings appear in the pick list. I share my favorites to google keep as a workaround. That aside, this app is simple and perfect. Thank you so much for creating amd maintaining it!",
            "Love this app! It has the readings from several books, all in one easy-to-use app. I use it to follow along with the readings during meetings, because I focus better when reading than I do when listening. :) Plus it's free!",
            "Very basic, nothing eyecatching in the way of colour and no option to share whole app with others, only daily reading. Bit disappointing but reading choice is good.",
            "Simple, clean, easy to use. Great resource. Thank you!!!",
            "Ive only begun to use this app, but i am amazed at how much is packed into one simple FREE app! I'm really taking my recovery seriously this time around and I'm always on the go. I walk and ride the bus to group and alot of meetings so this will really help me to travel lite. I really like to encorporate the daily meditations, prayers, and actions(like in Keep it Simple)into my daily routine and journaling, and with this app i have everything i need (Besides God and the Big Book)in one place!"

        "description": "Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\r\n\r\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\r\n \r\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\r\n\r\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\r\n\r\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\r\n\r\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety.

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

It's a very pleasing app to use, the ui looks very elegant and it actually feels like Chiku is asking me questions rather than me just ranting onto the paper. The o ly complaints I have are that it's going to be a massive pain to scroll to old stories and I feel as though the daily reads (for me) aren't too useful. Really great app! I'm considering buying the lifetime plan hoping this app doesn't get discontinued.",
            "Very nice app. It's more than an app. It's a safe space🌌. Meditation is very nice. The quotes are very good of course!! Im in love with this app. The themes are all so good. Writing here is so easy!! Love it.",
            "Easiest app to use. It is enough options to declare all your feelings and mood conditions, also, if you want you can add a written description about what's going on.",

            "I'd like to visit my previous entries with more ease. Please let me view them more easily without having to scroll sideways a lot. Also a go-to feature where you can find specific entries besides the filter would help. Also it would be nice to be able to save community blogs and daily quotes that inspired you. Maybe save them somewhere so you can access them any time. I also have experienced difficulty downloading the pdf versions of my entries."

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

It gives great detail of what its like living with BPD and BPD/Bipolar disorder and its posts help us really relate and can better understand better why we act and are the way we are. I haven't experienced any harshness from anyone. The remarks to the posts have been loving and kind, even helpful to some. I just wish my son would take the time to sit down and read what I've sent him or would do some research about it so he'd better understand me so we could get along again.",
            "I love this app, not only is it helping me to gain more knowledge of living with and managing borderline personality disorder. It is simple to use, easy to understand and a great source of information about BPD for non BPD sufferers.",

Some coping strategies provided, would benefit from more in-depth \"how to\" briefs in setting boundaries in a loving and supportive setting. Overall excellent app. Thank you",

These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others.\r\nPhysical symptoms often include excessive blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Stammering may be present, along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common for sufferers of social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion, especially if they are undiagnosed, untreated, or both; this can lead to alcoholism, eating disorders or other kinds of substance abuse. SAD is sometimes referred to as an illness of lost opportunities where \"individuals make major life choices to accommodate their illness\".  According to ICD-10 guidelines, the main diagnostic criteria of social phobia are fear of being the focus of attention, or fear of behaving in a way that will be embarrassing or humiliating, avoidance and anxiety symptoms. Standardized rating scales can be used to screen for social anxiety disorder and measure the severity of anxiety.",

You are never asked for your real name and we’ll never disclose your personal information.\r\n• A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY USE THERAPEER?\r\nYou're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.\r\nYes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.\r\nYes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don’t always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.\r\nYes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don’t want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.\r\nBut most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.\r\n\r\nWe get all of that. We get YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n• Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer. By doing so, it will help you deal with your own challenges in a broader perspective and will make you feel better by knowing you helped others in need.\r\n• Already gained the gratification of helping others? Go ahead and create your very own support room (or, if you don't want to wait, we offer the option to purchase a credit to open your room immediately).\r\n• After your private anonymous Support Room is opened, we match you with other Therapeer community members who have struggled with something similar to what you're experiencing. Peer assignment is based on your personal preferences and on the topic being discussed.\r\n\r\nJoin Therapeer today! Transform your struggles into strength, support people in need, and improve your own emotional well-being.\r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH US!\r\nFeel free to contact us anytime with your questions, comments, and suggestions.

            "This is such a awesome gift in my recovery! It helps me to be responsible and keep my own promises to myself as well, which I never used to do. I love seeing a layout of all my scheduled events daily. The fact I get rewarded for that is unbelievable and helps out so much! I love this app and look forward to checking in and staying clean and sober 1 day at a time with the help of Weconnect and all my support! Thanks so much for this opportunity to be a part of this recovery team!!!",
            "I used to give this a five-star review. Which has now be been changed to a one star as It used to work very well, now I wait 10 minutes for it to confirm my location or check off what I've done, if it does at all and I'm an IT specialist so my location/internet is on, its the app, even tried it on other phones it's still slow. Someone needs to do something about the ridiculously long waiting periods where ill push a button and it won't actually do anything or crashes NEEDS ADDRESSED ASAP",
            "If you're lucky like me, you will have this tool to help you in your recovery! Get daily reminders of appointments or support tasks you are scheduled for and get paid for it! The longer you're in recovery, the higher the reward. I'm currently getting $30 everytime I complete a 'challenge' which is usually from 10 to 25 tasks to complete. WC really has helped me stay on track and I love winning things, I rarely do so it's nice to be a winner! LOL",
            "WOW! This is an amazing app to assist in maintaining my recovery routine. It's an additional piece of accountability, free money is motivation to check in with self care routines and staying connected to my recovery community network.",
            "My account got deactivated without warning or reason. This app is a joke and time consuming. Dont waste your time that could be better spent on actual recovery. They track your every move with this app and if you don't use every single day you get kicked out...."

It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.\r\n\r\nThe Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.\r\n\r\nNet carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\nBMI is used to assess health risks and body structure but does not take in consideration muscular mass so it can sometimes be inaccurate, for instance in the case of athletes or pregnant women.\r\n\r\nDiabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.\r\n\r\nHyperglycemia (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia), is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.\r\n\r\nObservational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long-term cardiovascular health.",

It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food&#39;s effect on a person&#39;s blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.<br><br>The Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person&#39;s blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.<br><br>Net carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.<br><br>BMI is used to assess health risks and body structure but does not take in consideration muscular mass so it can sometimes be inaccurate, for instance in the case of athletes or pregnant women.<br><br>Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.<br><br>Hyperglycemia (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia), is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.<br><br>Observational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long-term cardiovascular health.",

Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "A wonderful app. I have covid19 and no doctors in my area will see me but because of the MD Live I am able to get the care and meds to help me.",
            "First time. Video quality was like typical for video chats - not sufficient for the Dr to diagnose anything visually, a photo is necessary. FYI, I was told that the wait would be 15 minutes or less and the video call came immediately as did a text message and a voice call telling me that I was in the queue - so that was a little annoying but I'm glad the service was very responsive!",
            "1st time using an app like this, I was skeptical, I was also desperate. Instead of waiting for open enrollment for medical insurance, this app is a Blessing to say the least. It was fast! & My prescription was at my neighborhood pharmacy in less than an hour! Thank you to the M.D. that helped me! And thank God for this app! Highly recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Freaking Awesome!!! No need to go into a doctor's office. Just video chat or phone call with an doctor, therapist or psychiatrist. The average wait time is minutes and you are in the comfort of your home, I was sitting at my desk at work. What a great app and company. Super excited !!!",
            "I love MDLive for it's convenience but I do question why there isn't an option for reoccurring appointments or a way that I didn't have to fill out the appointment request information weekly for my therapy visits. It's rather annoying that every week I have to fill out the information rather than just confirming the repeat appointment my therapist has set up. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars, and I have recommended this app to many friends of mine because I do find it to be amazing."

            "Full of weird notifications and ads, im sure they sell your data... The sleep score is useless, based almsot solely om what you put as how you feel when you woke up. I put i feel great after sleeping five hours with no (detected) REM and it gave me a 9.5! An hour after i said i felt great i crashed lol. Also, it cant detect awake vs. light sleep, at least not on my phone.",
            "I personally LOVE this app!!! I've only used it for 2 nights and decided to buy the full version. Not only does it show when you are in a deep or light sleep, but it records the sounds around you. It picked up my fan, the rain outside, vehicles going down the road and me snoring! I always take my phone with me if I wake up to go to bthrm or get a drink so it picked up on the fact I woke up. Definitely would recommend!",
            "It records your tossing and turning and will show in a colourful bar graph when you were in light and deep sleep, awake and also rem. It then gives you a percentage of how much of your sleep were in each category. It records the time you go to sleep (with an amount of time between switching on the 'start sleeping' and when you actually fall asleep). The basic (no payment option) saves only the last 7 sleeps of information - if you want it to save more you can pay (but I'm just using it free)",
            "I actually like it very much. So much that I bought the full version for a year. But since I got my new smartphone I can't save the audios anymore which was the main part for me to pay for it... The problem is got fixed in less than two weeks, the support is kind, fast and understanding",
            "This app is great. Noise factor is high, because of furnace running. It's by my bedroom. Otherwise it is really quiet here in the evening. It doesn't keep me awake. I use the sounds on my phone to help me fall asleep."

            "Great journal to keep you on track with any of the WOW hypnosis apps. I bought the 12 Weeks To WOW app first and love the changes I can see already. This app is the success journal that compliments it - I see the hypnosis app as being the subconscious side and this journal being the conscious side. It is a great way for me to practice and journal about the guidelines daily to track progress until I build new healthier habits... every day 1 step more towards letting go of that diet mentality.",
            "Not worth the money. I purchased this when I was in another app believing it was the full programme but alas no. you have to get yet another app which is a further £26.99in total or £2.99 per month for the actual hypnosis. I asked for the £6.99 to be refunded as it was not what I wanted or expected. The fact another person posted the same questions and issue in my FB question on their page tells you it isn't clear. The fact there are also a number of reviews commenting the same makes me feel disappointed and tired from trying to resolve this. Should be clearer. Should be easy to resolve Should look at their advert in other app ie Gastric band app as is obviously is not clear. 😔😔😔",
            "Not worth the money. you still require another app which you need to pay for. this is essentially an expensive online checklist calendar. same content is on other app as well. no options on cancelling. it should give you a trial first to see what it is or just app it to other app.",
            "only had the app 2 days and cant believe how well I sleep. I have been using meds for 2 years from anxiety as I couldnt sleep and this puts me out like a light! this was a huge bonus for me haha. as for weight loss I don't know yet (2 days is way to short) but i will put another review on when I know more. I am noticing I'm more thirsty than before",
            "Great app. Helping alongside my 121 sessions. Brilliant!!"

        "recentChanges": "Thanks for using Calm! This update contains multiple bug fixes and performance improvements. As always, you can expect an original Daily Calm every day, new music and Sleep Stories every week, and new Meditation programs every month.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think £50 for 30 minutes and £100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like £49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. £99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for £70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

            "I downloaded this app today and find it VERY useful. I can add all my favorite foods (the ones that aren't already on the app's list) and there is a calculator that allows you to figure out your favorite snacks. I was surprised that most of the \"healthy\" snack bars I was eating were high FP. There are even suggestions for eating out. I definitely recommend this app.",
            "It's hard to \"rate\" your symptoms, especially if they don't ever stop. Also if you're not consistent with your rating scheme it's not easy to track if you're actually getting better or what foods are bothering you. I'm at 2wk using the app and I'm feeling better but not 100%. I still belch frequently and have a low level of heart burn all the time and I don't go over ~20 points a day.",
            "I tried this diet on a whim, as a last ditch effort to avoid taking prilosec. I had been suffering from painful reflux for over two months. My ENT said the acid was reaching my voice box, which was why my voice was hoarse. I couldn't barely read my kids a book 😭 I kept thinking \"but I eat healthy! why is this happening to me?\" It turns out I was eating too many carbs and way too much fiber. I've been on the diet for 10 weeks now and I no longer need meds! I highly recommend the FTD.",
            "Very much enjoy using this app, along with the book that I imported from Amazon in the US. There are manual ways to calculate the FP points but we are finding that we have to do that more and more as there isn't as much variety in the foods and drinks that we would like.  I suppose living in the UK there are going to be some issues like that, some foods seem to be American orientated.  Then there are some oddities like prepared porridge oats, prepared with what - water or whole milk or skimmed milk etc..?   Good app overall and compliments the book well, for an understanding as to why FP points could be important to your digestive health.  I wonder if this app is due for an update anytime, and if so what might be included....?",
            "I like the app even though there are still foods missing like couscous, napa cabbage, and probably much more, it has a feature to add custom foods but the app doesn't accept decimal points (like 1.5g), and it's almost impossible to find the sugar alcohol content of many foods. It's an excellent start and I hope Norm doesn't give up on this app which has tremendous potential to achieve mainstream status."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

I'm a visual person so being able to see my food intake for the day, week, month is brilliant and really informative, im already making more informed choices for what to eat. Thank you so much for this, well worth the cash.",
            "I have to agree with others. The app's limited ability to only assess each meal at a time instead of over the course of a day can be discouraging. Edited to add: Updating the app to explain the 80/20 rule would have been helpful BEFORE charging so many of us.",
            "Not useful, this app is preprogrammed to certain foods and proportions as the developers think, but you can eat a perfectly balanced meal, and the app will rate it with a poor score, difficult to explain, but I gotta say: I regret every penny wasted. Uninstalled the first day",
            "its way too expensive for the little features it has. plus i thought it was smart enough to give u a score on the picture. but u actually score urself. and even if the plate is healthy but u dont have any sweets on it then its not a 5 star.",
            "Great Concept: Has issues. The way the portions are setup and rated needs work: Like with snacks. If you don't put in junk good your rating is lower. For a meal:"

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

        "description": "This is a free app containing information about hepatitis disease symptoms causes treatment and diet & food tips. Hepatitis is a disease that affects the organ liver –that plays a vital role in keeping our body healthy by removing impurities from the food we eat. Everything you eat and drink passes through your liver.\r\n\r\nHepatitis is generally caused by virus and is classified into five different types: Hepatitis A Hepatitis B hepatitis C hepatitis D and hepatitis E. Hepatitis B, C and D occur primarily due to contact with infected bodily fluids. The primary causes of Hepatitis A and E are consumption of contaminated water and food. Other causes include eating raw oysters or raw shellfish or raw meat - which carry a higher risk of a Hepatitis A infection.\r\nNot all forms of hepatitis are infectious. Alcohol, medicines, and chemical may be bad for the liver and cause inflammation. A person may have a genetic problem, a metabolic disorder, or an immune related injury. Obesity can be a cause of liver damage which can lead to inflammation. These are known as non-infectious causes.\r\n\r\nEating a balance diet plays important role in treatment of hepatitis. The diet should include foods that are easy on the liver and exclude foods that cause the liver to work harder as this can delay a patient’s recovery from the disease.\r\n\r\nFruits and vegetables should be a significant part of any diet to help in recovering from a liver disease. They are full of essential nutrients and are easy to digest. As a bonus, they also contain antioxidants, which can protect the liver cells from damage.\r\nHealthy proteins in the form of low-fat milk and dairy products along with lean meats, beans, eggs and soy products can also be a part of a healthy liver diet.\r\nAvoiding deep fried spicy and oily foods is a restriction the patient should follow. \r\nDrinking more water and healthy fluids helps in quick recovery.",

            "It would be nice if there were less sentences. More on key words. Work on making the app more visually appealing as it is simple. SEARCH BOX, I would highly recommend. So it will be easier to find the words and diseases I'm looking for. More pictures, to differentiate as well. And the ability to zoom. It would be nice to see the disorders clinically, histologically, radiographically as well.",
            "I have to give this app 4-stars, for the following reasons: the privacy policy comes up in a pop-up which is very straightforward and readable (at first it suprised me bc it's the first time this has happened to me on an app)-great pictures-great organization -easy to rate your app in the left toolbar. Here are my suggestions/wishes:  More pictures; for example, the mandibular condylar hyperplasia, fractured and avulsed teeth, and burning mouth syndrome etc. Thanks for the many many awesome pics already there.  I can't enlarge/zoom any of the pictures in the \"Dental Instruments.\" If that changes, I'll bump my review to 5-stars.",
            "There is ads every 5 seconds. I've never even made a review for an app before till now. I can't even look at labeled anatomy diagrams and follow where the line is pointing at without an ad popping up to then lose my spot. Not good for learning. Good concept, but you're better off doing what I did and screenshotting everything and looking off your phone gallery instead",
            "Over all I found it very informative. However when every 3-5 seconds you are forced to watch a 15 sec ad you can't really get much out of this app. I understand using ads to keep the app free but this was over kill. So I deleted"

        "description": "Features: \r\n• Enter your own personal fear \r\n• Create a fear hierarchy\r\n• Complete exposure tasks while live updating your anxiety levels\r\n\r\nEffective against: \r\n• Phobias (snakes, spiders, heights, flying, etc.)\r\n• Social anxiety disorder\r\n• Post-traumatic stress disorder\r\n• Panic disorder\r\n• Generalized anxiety disorder\r\n• Obsessive-compulsive disorders \r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nExposure therapy is one of psychology's greatest, most effective treatment tools that have been discovered over the past few decades. A key technique in behavior therapy for anxiety, exposure therapy involves gradually exposing someone to their feared object, situation, or task without any danger in order to overcome their anxiety. This app enables people to go through exposure therapy.\r\n\r\nBefore exposure, users first create a fear hierarchy - a list of activities that induce anxiety ranked from highest to lowest. Then, they work through the activities in the fear hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-inducing activity and working their way up.\r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. \r\n\r\nDetailed Guide: \r\nMany people with phobias recognize their fear as illogical, but their mind is still afraid nonetheless. This is because the primal fear centers of our mind act subconsciously whenever it spots anything it thinks is dangerous (such as lions or snakes) in order to escape immediately. However, in today's modern society when we don't have to worry about predators eating us, our minds can often trigger false alarms to things that aren't actually dangerous. \r\n\r\nThe fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there. \r\n\r\nTo break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous. The most important principle is to make sure that the fear leaves before you do. \r\n\r\nThis app helps you break the fear. First, add what you are afraid of and then construct a list of activities that will induce various levels of anxiety. Then, you can start exposing yourself by doing these activities starting from what gives you the least amount of anxiety. During the exposure process, you can track your anxiety levels by updating it continuously, and finish when it falls to 20/100 or lower. As you work your away through the activities, your fear should continue to fall! \r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. If you leave the activity before your anxiety falls, then this will actually reinforce your fear instead of lowering it. Try starting with the easiest activity first. Going straight to a challenging task might actually increase your fear. It is very difficult to stay in a situation when your entire body is screaming at you to leave, especially if there is no person there coaxing you to stay and wait.",

Then, they work through the activities in the fear hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-inducing activity and working their way up.<br><br>Warning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. <br><br><b>Detailed Guide</b>: <br>Many people with phobias recognize their fear as illogical, but their mind is still afraid nonetheless. This is because the primal fear centers of our mind act subconsciously whenever it spots anything it thinks is dangerous (such as lions or snakes) in order to escape immediately. However, in today&#39;s modern society when we don&#39;t have to worry about predators eating us, our minds can often trigger false alarms to things that aren&#39;t actually dangerous. <br><br>The fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there. <br><br>To break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous. The most important principle is to make sure that the fear leaves before you do. <br><br>This app helps you break the fear. First, add what you are afraid of and then construct a list of activities that will induce various levels of anxiety. Then, you can start exposing yourself by doing these activities starting from what gives you the least amount of anxiety. During the exposure process, you can track your anxiety levels by updating it continuously, and finish when it falls to 20/100 or lower. As you work your away through the activities, your fear should continue to fall! <br><br>Warning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. If you leave the activity before your anxiety falls, then this will actually reinforce your fear instead of lowering it. Try starting with the easiest activity first. Going straight to a challenging task might actually increase your fear. It is very difficult to stay in a situation when your entire body is screaming at you to leave, especially if there is no person there coaxing you to stay and wait.",

If you leave the app or just want to check any other app on your phone, the stopwatch freezes and you can't continue even if you update the anxiety 2. Add some kind of history so you can see your progress over time 3. If I did exposure in the evening, in the morning it is still marked with the star (done), while it should be reset so you can practice it again.",

At last I want to tell you this app is very nice please download it and do exercise at home regularly and stay fit. I also thank all those who make this app. This app is very helpful. Once again Thankyou all 🙏🙏😉😉",
            "I absolutely love it! First of all, you don't have to pay for keeping your body healthy like most off the other apps(I got no money). Second of all, it gives you a food planning thing which is really healthy for our body. Third of all, it keeps track of your everyday workouts and your weight. I just really like this app, definitely should get it if you want to lose weight. 😊",
            "It's a great simple app to remind myself to do a little exercise every day. The workouts may seem easy to some, but I find they work muscles that are easily missed during typical weight lifting workouts. With a little know how, it'ss easy to modify the exercises to increase or decrease difficulty. Most of the moves can be performed with very little noise or jumping around. It gets a little monotonous after a few weeks.",
            "Very very very goood app. I live it. I has really worked on me. The coach this app. She is really very good. She gives us tip and directions of the exercise very well. She even mentions where to the exercise like in bed and stuff. I recommend it to every one who wishes ti get fit and loose weight. I swear it really works or effects on u. And the diet plan no words. I really appreciate it and thank u. Keep going.",
            "OMG ! This app is wonderful. First of all we can lose our weight without money. I could loss my weight easily with the instructions voice coach had told. If you follow the exercises correctly you can also find the changes. I will give this app 5 star because of the changes I found while I did the exercises. Thank you very much for Making this app wonderful."

Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

        "recentChanges": "Meet the new generation of Replika avatars! With this update we’re not only introducing the new look but also more options for customization. Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

One tiny feature request though please, developers - it would be great if the diary card component offered pop-up info cards for the various skills it gives to tick off if we've used them, so we can remind ourselves of skills we may not be as familiar with, or that we've forgotten the name of.",
            "I like the feature, but I don't like that I cannot install the app onto my laptop. The describe section is difficult to do from the phone, especially when you have a lot to say. My particular voice to text doesn't work as well I'd like when recording, especially if I'm writing about an emotionally minded experience. I'd like the freedom to work both from my phone and my laptop. :) I know that fellow classmates have wanted the ability to print their reports as well for personal tracking, for those of us that are hands-on learners.",
            "Not What I Thought It Was. I am currently looking for a flexible DBT diary card app that allows me to add diary card entries, as needed, for each entry type, as well as hide and/or delete entries that aren't relevant to my needs. I also need to be able to go back and edit my entries, as I like, as sometimes I may forget to do a diary card for a particular day, or I'll find I simply inputted something incorrectly and didn't notice. This app is not for the patient, but for the health professional."

        "description": "Have your crisis plan available anytime.\r\n\r\nIn a psychological crisis it is important to act quickly. With the help of the Safety Plan App you can easily access your safety plan at any time on your smartphone. The App also enables you to view your coping strategies and get in touch with people who can help.\r\n\r\nThe value of a safety plan has been proven in several acclaimed psychotherapies, for example in cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Those affected by depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorders, addictive disorders and even bulimia or binge eating often create safety plans to help them manage difficult situations. With the aid of this App you can access your own safety plan quickly and easily on your smartphone.\r\n\r\nImportant: make sure that you create your safety plan together with a psychotherapist. Having done that, you can then simply enter it into the App so that it is easy to retrieve from your smartphone at any time.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the App developed by the Robert Enke Foundation (EnkeApp), the Safety Plan App is designed to help you in a crisis situation. There is, however, no paid service provided. You need to enter the telephone numbers of your own contacts who will be able to help you in a crisis. Why not give it a go?\r\n\r\nThe App is not intended to recognise, prevent, monitor, treat or alleviate illnesses. The App acts like a notebook, allowing you simply to enter the steps of your personal safety plan so that they can be quickly accessed.

With the help of the Safety Plan App you can easily access your safety plan at any time on your smartphone. The App also enables you to view your coping strategies and get in touch with people who can help.<br><br>The value of a safety plan has been proven in several acclaimed psychotherapies, for example in cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Those affected by depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorders, addictive disorders and even bulimia or binge eating often create safety plans to help them manage difficult situations. With the aid of this App you can access your own safety plan quickly and easily on your smartphone.<br><br>Important: make sure that you create your safety plan together with a psychotherapist. Having done that, you can then simply enter it into the App so that it is easy to retrieve from your smartphone at any time.<br><br>Similar to the App developed by the Robert Enke Foundation (EnkeApp), the Safety Plan App is designed to help you in a crisis situation. There is, however, no paid service provided. You need to enter the telephone numbers of your own contacts who will be able to help you in a crisis. Why not give it a go?<br><br>The App is not intended to recognise, prevent, monitor, treat or alleviate illnesses. The App acts like a notebook, allowing you simply to enter the steps of your personal safety plan so that they can be quickly accessed. Do keep a physical copy of your safety plan with you, however, so that you are still prepared even if your smartphone breaks or runs out of battery.<br><br>We would be grateful for your feedback!",

I would love the ability to add more than one coping strategy, support person, etc. The link when you first open the app to get more guidance on how to develop a safety plan is dead. Fixing this is critical to the app's usefulness. A walkthrough to customize the plan when you first open the app would be amazing.",

DO NOT waste your time with this app. (I'd skip anything by this \"company\" as well. FFS, there's a GLARING typo in the description for their Mood Tracker App. Get it together!)",

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "It's great, the exercises are good and the customisation allows you to adjust it to your level and capabilities, although the ads might be quite annoying that's a good way to keep this as a free to use app. Also the water tracking is great, I always forget to drink water either bc I'm busy or I don't pay attention to it, this is quite helpful.",
            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard 💪.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

For example, recreating 10 airplane take-offs in a row, or having the patient ride the elevator without stopping for five minutes.\r\n\r\n- Safer Environments: Both the patient and the therapist have complete control at all times of what is happening.\r\n\r\n- Self-training: The patient does not have to wait for the events to take place in real life but can produce and reproduce them whenever he wishes. \r\n\r\n- Scientifically Validated: More than a decade of controlled studies have proven the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy.\r\n\r\n- More Privacy: It offers a greater degree of privacy than in vivo exposure.",

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

The diet includes moderate amounts of fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, healthy fats (think oily fish, nuts, seeds, etc) and low amounts of red meat, processed foods and sugar. What's more, the Mediterranean diet is all about taking time over your food and being social – two other healthy approaches when it comes to eating.\r\n\r\nThe single most important factor in determining your health is the quality of the decisions that you make every day. You can take the time to start the necessary steps to improve your health today by beginning with the following:\r\n\r\n• Know about the health of your brain – get a base line brain health assessment.\r\n• Know your health numbers – you need to optimize your important health numbers, not just normalize them.\r\n• Avoid anything that hurts your brain and may cause brain injuries – engage in regular brain healthy habits.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that Alzheimer’s disease starts decades before you have any symptoms and untreated Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and addictions all increase your risk for it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important ways to decrease your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is to decrease all of the risk factors for it.\r\n\r\nEven if you are healthy it will still be good to consider avoiding foods that will hurt your brain.

You could also talk with friends, I say that it's a nice thing of them to put different servers in different areas, so it's better for some player's lag. The only problem I'd see is that black holes or any kind of hole spawning on your blob. Also, when you die from being really really big your screen still stays zoomed out. Great game!",

            "Its awesome, I found how many forms are there in yoga, even for beginners. Its nice to calculate that we are not that fit as we feel. We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",
            "I think it's a great game you should download it it really help me right now I've finished day one and the wrist workout oh I help me alot cuz my right wrist use to make the crack sound when I spin it and now it totally fine. I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

I had trouble understanding what you were supposed to do in some of the minigames. Second, Your not given enough time to figure out each minigame. Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",
            "I love this game so much, I grew up playing this, so this is kinda a big think to me. I don't mind the ads at all! But that's in my opinion. I love the minigames and the characters so much, this game just makes me happy :)",
            "I adore this game, I just wish that there was an option to turn off the tilting games. As someone with shaking hands (and mine are far from the worst) I always end up dying in these rounds, and it ruins the gameplay.",

            "i love this game alot, ive been playing it for quite a while now since only a few characters were out and running. the game play is good, graphics, everything. i first i thought i was lagging because i had bad internet but now i just realized that my phone was just old. besides that, theres one issue. cost for essence and characters are WAY too much, some people was hundreds of dollars on this game for skins. can you maybe lower the price. it really isnt fair.",
            "The characters, abilitys, gameplay, and everything else is great! It takes a little while to get used to the sensitivitys and controls but its nice. The only problem im having is when im hiding and the hunter (starter hunter) is like so far away they cant possibly see me but come straight toward me, its confusing and makes me a little frustated but overall its an amazing game that has great graphics, gameplay, and very creative story line!",
            "The app is good. I liked playing it. It was really fun. But when the maintenance was done I started lagging even worse than before and it says that my internet connection was so low but its completely fine. My connection was all the way up. I was so close where my internet comes from but I still lag. I would have given a 5 star review but the lagging was so bad and worst than last time. And also, fix the camping, it sucks. Fix these problems please NetEase",
            "The reason why I gave Identity V 4 stars is because, it's a really good game and I love to play it but sometimes, I just lag a lot. I ever went to 995 ms and I could never get green ping. My wifi is fine, there's nothing wrong with it and my storage isn't full too. I just can't enjoy Identity V that much since it's lagging. I can't even walk properly since its so laggy. My normal ping is usually red like 325 ms and I'm okay with that, just today and yesterday, the ping was 995 ms.",
            "The game is absolutely phenomenal in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. However after a while the gameplay gets old and the unclear, barely existent story doesn't help either. The gameplay is also unbalanced as the variety of survivors and their special abilities are completely overshadowed by the hunter's. This is a very addicting game to play for a couple weeks but after that it begins to become boring, repetitive and annoying. The game also requires a powerhouse of a mobile device to run."

It creates a graphic which you can visualize daily, weekly or monthly for each value. In muscle and fat mass it let's you input the values in percentage or kg (if it's metric), the issue here is that if you've been tracking your fat in kg, and you want to change it to percentage, the values remain the same and you have to change them manually and viceversa",

Overall, I'd recommend this app to anyone trying to keep track of reaching a specified goal for your fitness journey or a healthier lifestyle.",

It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

Im actually having lots of fun playing this, it runs well, the ads aren't annoying, and over all the cooking is pretty fun! All i ask is to fix the chopping part a little so its easier, but thats it c:",

You literally just tap whatever you feel like and drag your finger over those things and \"win\", moving onto the next tap anything and swipe your finger for a second level. If you love winning and hate effort, this is probably the download for you!"

            "Horrible game designed by someone who has no respect, empathy, or understanding for people who genuinely experience depression. The game offers nonsensical solutions to generic descriptions of how someone might describe their depression. Figures but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and not only did the game live up to its criticisms but the ads ruin its playability entirely. It's insulting tapping for a hint to see it for a nanosecond before an ad pops up preventing you from reading the hint.",
            "This feels like a soulless cashgrab, made to keep people watching ads. Most of the tasks are so convoluted, that I found myself pressing hint every time. For people with depression, like myself, this app is terrible at helping anyone through it. The people/person responsible for this, has no heart.",
            "Pretty mediocre. One of the puzzles didn't work for me regardless of me doing what the hint said to do, and the barrage of ads on the hints leave a bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes it'll only play an ad and no hint. Sucks because this had potential.",
            "Annoying as hell! Definitely makes me feel trapped like depression, great on that, but anytime i click 'hint' cause i can't get passed, all I'm met with is an ad for 30 seconds and can't read the actual hint that flashes on the screen for like half a milisecond!",
            "Very unique. This game describes how depression feels and i belive thats a great way to show people who dont quite understand how it feels. Each level is seemingly a challange but then agsin depression is as well. Good job compairing it to a puzzle because depression can take a while to figure out and piece together. As someone who can relate to being in depression you did a good job making each level a bit difficult to represent how hard it is in real life. Cool game. Would recomend. 10/10."

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "Very useful app, which will be of great help. Mark is an excellent hypnotist. His 'Relief From Arthritis' hypnotherapy session is also excellent for example. Not only has it helped me to control the pain, but the night time session sends me to sleep at the end nearly every night. Highly recommended.",
            "Amazing app. Its been couple of weeks since I have uploaded this app. I have been listening to the getting rid of procrastination every night before going to bed. I feel like its helping me. The app has range of content to listen to. I'll go through most of them. Its like meditation. I am feeling the positive change. I would definately recommend to people out there looking for a positive change in their life. Check the content in this app.",
            "Relax and improve yourself at the same time. I find the relaxation really helps me to slow down and live more deliberately. Mark quickly made it to my top favorite hypno recordings. His soothing voice is his magic ingredient to making the world disappear for 30 minutes. This app makes getting a session easy and convenient.",
            "This is by far the best hypnosis package out there. Mark Bowden helps you to get to the route of your issue in such relaxing and enjoyable hypnosis sessions. There are so many to choose from and you are able to pick and choose sessions which can work well together. His voice is extremely calming and with regular use, I can guarantee that you can expect genuine healing and positive changes in your life. Lucy MacMaster 🌈",
            "Great sessions. Better than expected. 3 stars given due to interrupted playback when offline/playing downloaded sessions. Please develop an option to play purchased sessions outside of the app to eliminate this problem which has been reported by users on the website as well."

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

I do wish there was an easier, more streamlined way to deal with orders that finally arrive at the house-- incorrect -- though. I can't deal directly with the restaurant and the app is very time consuming when dealing with having paid for the food, tip, tax, fee, and delivery for something that isn't acceptable."

            "You say there are still future plans that a new season with new content will be released gradually. And you want the players to be patient. I would say its too late for that since many have now decided to uninstall this game, since your last announcement. Promises of future content isn't what makes a great game. The lack of providing a fresh new gaming experience to the players is what brings a game crashing down. I too have decided to uninstall Disorder since your last announcement.",
            "The reason why I put 4 stars is because when I first downloaded the game, I thought it was impossible to win but all you need is strategy. Another reason is because when ever I am matching, it would take a lot of time to let me in a group. Other than that, the graphics and the gameplay is the one of the BEST. I highly recommend this game. Like LEGIT.",
            "This game has been in Season 0 for months now since it's launch, there has been no updates and no changes what so ever, you guys really gotta focus on updating your games more cuz it gets really boring when theres nothing new, I've enjoyed the game when it was just launched but now since there's nothing new it just got really boring.",
            "This is a cool game, indeed. But a while ago, my friend got trashtalked for a stupid reason. Her teammates camped in opponents base while my friend just played the game normally than they did. What's the use of base battle if their just gonna kill the opponent and not capture the base, right?! I hope that the players are playing fair. And also she's lagging even though her connections fine!!! That's why she deleted the game. I don't think she'll play this anymore. Full of foul players!",
            "The game mechanics are great the characters and skills aswell but thiers 2 things I dont like about the game 1. is that the servers right now aren't that good u can be waiting for a match to start 5mins or more that is if ur lucky, I've been playing solo this whole time for that reason. 2. When I first download this game I thought oh this is going to be a Battle royale since I'm into last man standing but it's more like capture the flag and pretty much ur efforts are worthless so for now bye👋"

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "I came back after 2 years just to see lots of bugs, disconnecting every 5 minutes. Just for the fact that they improved the graphics, and my phone can totally handle that but the connection issue is breaking the game. Is unplayable. I will change my stars review if I will be able to play again and rate for the improvements .",
            "Great game! Great graphic n gameplay. Its totally f2p friendly even though Im spending a fair amount also just for support the game. Really appreciate the developer for the hardworks. Thanks for accompany me. What a good memories. Shout out to exos heroes : learn from this game, don't be irresponsible and banned players for your mistakes.",
            "Would rate higher due to the fact the game is alot of. But can't rate higher simply due to the fact that as fun as this game is. It is already over 13GB of data on your phone, and with the new update it makes it even larger. This game is becoming more of a PC only type game instead of a mobile game. The Creators of this game need to invest as much time removing the useless parts of the game as they do in creating new content for it to balance it all out.",
            "Great update on the game engine. I love the new town as well. I wish there was more of a 3D aspect to it game-wise. Would make the game feel more immersive and actually feel like you're an onmyoji. Still the game has great graphics and good lore. 5/5 stars",
            "This game is fun , it can also be a game for busy people . I'm a senior so I'm quite busy but this game have the \"auto\" which is really helpful , I can just do my thing while it auto it self . I hope all the event have auto so it would be easier for me / busy people UwU . Other things is I know that there aren't enough khmer people to gain a server but please make khmer laugauge available please I just want a khmer name / name my shiki khmer"

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

            "I gave this game 3 stars! I love this game so much but... When I updated the game, all my dolls dissapered! I got really sad and angry. I wish I never updated the game. By the way I have some suggestions that you can add into the game: 1: When you update the game, you don't lose all yours dolls. 2: Add more outfits for the girls. 3: For the black eye color it should be darker. I love this game soo much. Thanks for making this game. I REALLY enjoy it!",
            "I love this game. It helps you be creative and choose who you want to create. People without premium get to have a challange were they get to use items that arent premium. I also love this game because it brought me closer to my friends that don't live near me and they end up installing the app. One thing i would like to add would be like hats or bows so you can have things in your hair without paying for premium. I hope this helps everyone that reads this. Thank you for making this game. 😊",
            "5/5 Stars!! I love this game so much! It's a great way to make avatars and you could even make your self and, try out different looks! There is minimal ads but, there could be a spin wheel that you can watch ads to spin and get like a daily spin to earn coins. You could then use those coins to unlock some of the locked items just for 1 or 2 uses. Mainly because some of the best items are locked and only for premium users. Other than that love this game and 10/10 recommend!!",
            "Very fun, adorable avatars, and I love the hairstyles and the fact you can layer the clothes, only one thing, this is just extra kind of feedback, maybe add a few more things, but overall it is amazing! Also it's not even that, that is the only thing I would say about improving this app! Super fun, and the fact you've included masks is another great feature, and shows your respect and seriousness towards the pandemic. Great job!",
            "This is a really great game. I personally think that you could add a new option for creating dolls (full body option) Aswell as this, you could also add some cool postitions for your doll to pose in, this way when you save your dolls they will be in a cool position and you can also see there legs aswell. Other than this, this is one of my favorite games to play. 👍🏻"

            "Update 5.0 replaced most battles with \"skips\". Turn the game on, Skip 700 battles, auto-pvp for 10 times in 2 modes, turn it off. As for guild war, the same pay-to-win guild has been #1 since the game's launch. The devs really need to balance things so other people have some chance. Anyone who tries their best to get that gw win just once will be sorely disappointed and might as well go play something else. Same people are always #1 in all other modes too. It's a joke.",
            "Played this game for a couple of years. It was fun! But, I slowly saw it go from time2win to pay2win. I used to just let my phone run so I could grind the best 6 star armour. Every now and then they have specialty characters I would purchase for a couple of bucks. Nothing expensive though. But now I can't even fight bosses w/o paying for a \"skip\" token? I can't even get the option to choose valor like I did before! Welp, guess it's time to move on to another mobile game.",
            "I really enjoyed this game for several months and it was the only one of these types of games I spent money on. it has been a generous game and the one experience i had with customer service was good. The latest patch however 5.0 i think, was a disappointment. It took the fun out of it for me. Adding new features is generally a positive, but not when you overwrite other features. It made it ungrindable. I haven't really been interested to play after trying the new update.",
            "With the new update you really don't have the chance to play ,the skip system won't let you see how your heirs are doing in the dungeon because don't allow to see the fights so if you don't see the fights how you gonna chose the heir that fit you . I consider the developers need to give us the option to chose between skip and use valors. Thanks",
            "Don't bother with this game, you'll soon realize you can't keep up as a f2p player. New unit every other month that is broken so they can release the next one to control it, rinse and repeat since the beginning if the game. Now with 5.0 update they completely gutted the game of what made it unique. Add in the worst type of content in gacha: gear/rune crafting. Materials for this type of content dominate drops from gear/rune dungeons, crafted gears/runes are notoriously worse than farmed version"

            "It looks funny but all it does is continuously drop you into mini games that are so fast that literally by the time you've read and understood the instructions you've already lost. At least once it didn't even give me instructions. And you can't retry; it just instantly drops you into another game. Let me read instructions before starting and give me more than 3 or 4 seconds to play it, and then let me retry, and maybe it would be playable.",
            "Loved this & the original for manyyy years now ! It's one of those games that has a style all its own; very hard to replicate !, It's a blast to play, humorous, lifts my mood no matter the day. Excited to try Dumb Ways To Die3 ! Thank you ! Buying a few others too like the hospital & cooking games not just for myself but my 4 year old lol ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "I cant even explain how much joy this brings me! Its classical fun and hilariousness! This was my childhood and I love it. I highly recommend this to you! If you don't have it, download it. You'll thank me in the future. It brings back so many childhood memories with me and my brother! It deserves the best game of the world, in all seriousness, amazing game. Nothing id change about it. I'm so glad I found this again!",
            "I like the game alot when it's playable but had to many glitches for my taste. Got nothing but a black screen a few times and had to close out also had several times where the controls didn't respond at all.",
            "It's actually really entertaining to me and to the people I proposed this game to. Download it, you won't be disappointed. Really fun. If its lagging it ain't the games problem. Thank you for making this addicting game."

Awesome to kill time, but the forced ads after just about every single round is a real buzz kill, especially when its after dying instantly to an AI spawned with really fast 1-shot projectiles killing the instant you spawn in. Not only do they spawn with unbeatable set ups sometimes, they have up to 6,000HP is as high as I've noticed. I have 717HP, still a 1-shot with anything let alone this.

When you are playing the game and you are near The spikes but not even close to them to where they should hurt you, they decrease your damage anyway That is something that needs to be fixed.

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

        "description": "It’s a busy world. You fold the laundry while keeping one eye on the kids and another on the television. You plan your day while listening to the radio and commuting to work, and then plan your weekend. But in the rush to accomplish necessary tasks, you may find yourself losing your connection with the present moment—missing out on what you’re doing and how you’re feeling. Did you notice whether you felt well-rested this morning or that forsythia is in bloom along your route to work?\r\nMindfulness is the practice of purposely focusing your attention on the present moment—and accepting it without judgment. Mindfulness is now being examined scientifically and has been found to be a key element in stress reduction and overall happiness.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of mindfulness has roots in Buddhism, but most religions include some type of prayer or meditation technique that helps shift your thoughts away from your usual preoccupations toward an appreciation of the moment and a larger perspective on life.\r\n\r\nProfessor emeritus Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder and former director of the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, helped to bring the practice of mindfulness meditation into mainstream medicine and demonstrated that practicing mindfulness can bring improvements in both physical and psychological symptoms as well as positive changes in health, attitudes, and behaviors.\r\n\r\nMindfulness improves well-being. Increasing your capacity for mindfulness supports many attitudes that contribute to a satisfied life. Being mindful makes it easier to savor the pleasures in life as they occur, helps you become fully engaged in activities, and creates a greater capacity to deal with adverse events. By focusing on the here and now, many people who practice mindfulness find that they are less likely to get caught up in worries about the future or regrets over the past, are less preoccupied with concerns about success and self-esteem, and are better able to form deep connections with others.\r\n\r\nMindfulness improves physical health. If greater well-being isn’t enough of an incentive, scientists have discovered that mindfulness techniques help improve physical health in a number of ways. Mindfulness can: help relieve stress, treat heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduce chronic pain, , improve sleep, and alleviate gastrointestinal difficulties.\r\n\r\nMindfulness improves mental health. In recent years, psychotherapists have turned to mindfulness meditation as an important element in the treatment of a number of problems, including: depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, couples’ conflicts, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder",

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

        "title": "Intermittent Fasting",
        "description": "Intermittent Fasting is an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting.\r\n\r\nIt does not say anything about which foods to eat, but rather when you should eat them.\r\n\r\nThere are several different intermittent fasting methods, all of which split the day or week into eating periods and fasting periods.\r\n\r\nMost people already \"fast\" every day, while they sleep.

Today, the Center stands as the largest and most comprehensive program of its kind in the country and as a successful model for other adolescent focused health care efforts. MSAHC offers a comprehensive array of medical, sexual and reproductive, and mental and dental health services, plus prevention, health education, and support services. Its multidisciplinary team of physicians, physician assistants, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nutritionists, health educators and other health professionals strive to help young people become full and responsible partners in their health care, which is demonstrated in the Center’s lower rates of teen pregnancy, substance abuse, untreated mental health issues, and learning differences. In addition to core services, youth who come to the MSAHC can also receive\r\n\r\n•\tNutrition and wellness\r\n•\tComprehensive dental care\r\n•\tObesity prevention and eating disorder treatment\r\n•\tSubstance-abuse prevention and treatment\r\n•\tPregnancy prevention\r\n•\tTeen-parenting services - for teen parents and their infants/toddlers\r\n•\tViolence prevention and treatment - including crisis intervention and ongoing care for victims of sexual violence\r\n•\tComprehensive services for HIV-positive and at-risk youth - medical care, mental health care, and support services\r\n•\tLegal services\r\n•\tCommunity outreach and school-based services\r\n\r\nThe MSAHC is finding ways to bridge the gap between the need for, and the delivery of, health care among teens.

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

            "I love this app because it keeps my mind busy. It is a learning app, which a lot of the things in this app is more than I can understand. Because I think I get the right answer and I don't because it shows me the answer to I believe.",
            "I really enjoy this app! There are a few grammatical errors, but I don't understand why that is a problem for some,it's the message/information that counts,it's still readable,& surely that's the main thing. Excellent information,IMHO,so 5 stars from me. Only minor issue so far,is sometimes if I wish to share,there's a pop-up reading \"Error-Fill\"? But it doesn't hinder me from sharing,so it's not really a \"problem\" per sè. Thank you so much Dhanesha,~please keep it up👍🏼😊👍🏻,Miss D",
            "Accurate for the most part, but definitely some questionable 'facts'. A lot of them also seem to contradict themselves. A few repetitions but I was expecting that. The grammar really isn't as bad as some of the other reviews say, it's not illegible or anything, just a little off in the sentence structures. I found it perfectly easy to understand. Overall, good to learn some new information, but if you don't already know a bit of psychology you might not be able to tell which facts aren't true.",
            "I was not expecting much from this app. I was not expecting every fact to be repeated 3x in each section. While they may have been interesting the first time I read one... not so much the 2nd time, & the 3rd time was a complete disappointment. It should read: \"Eleven New Facts Repeated Three Times.\" Granted I stopped reading after the second section was just like the first.",
            "it's basically a good app. you have to think for yourself and be aware of ANYTHING that you read, not accepting another person's written word just because it's there. errors and typos shouldn't be an issue if you are a self thinker. the original is probably in a language other than english and when translated (by a translation app) word for word some things will be lost or skewed in the translation. all of this should be considered in our review. so I give it a 3."

In addition, the meals preparation is simple and it does not required a lot of ingredients. This app is a simplified version of Intermittent Fasting for newbies / beginners. Just follow the instructions provided in the apps throughout your fasting process.\r\n\r\nApps Features includes:\r\n1. Overview about the Diet\r\n2. Intermittent Fasting Meal Plan: 7 Days\r\n3. Tips in Getting Started for IF\r\n4. Frequent Ask Questions\r\n5. Share this App\r\n6. App Info\r\n\r\nWhat is Intermittent Fasting (IF)?\r\nIF is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn’t specify which foods you should eat but rather when the right time you should eat them. This is type of fasting is described as an eating pattern rather than diet. Common intermittent fasting methods involve daily 16-hour fasts or fasting for 24 hours, twice per week.\r\n\r\nIntermittent fasting method\r\nThere are several different ways to do intermittent fasting. All of them split the day or week into eating and fasting periods. During the fasting periods, you eat either very little or nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThese are the most popular methods:\r\nThe 16/8 method: also called the Lean gains protocol, it involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, such as 1 – 9pm. Then you fast for 16 hours in between.\r\n\r\nEat-Stop-Eat: This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week, for example by not eating from dinner one day until dinner the next day.\r\n\r\nThe 5:2 diet: with this methods, you consume only 500 – 600 calories on two non-consecutive days of the week, but eat normally the other 5 days.\r\n\r\nBy reducing your calorie intake, all of these methods should cause weight loss as long as you don’t compensate by eating much more during the eating periods. Most people find the 16/8 method to be the simplest, most sustainable and easiest to stick to. It’s also the most popular. If you’re just getting started, it is recommended to start with the 16/8 method, then perhaps later move on to longer fasts. It’s important to experiment and find a method that works for you.\r\n\r\nThere are several important health benefits when you’re are intermittent fasting;\r\n\r\n1. WEIGHTLOSS\r\nAs mentioned above, intermittent fasting can help you lose weight and belly fat, without having to consciously restrict calories\r\n\r\n2. INSULIN RESISTANCE\r\nIntermittent fasting can reduce insulin resistance, lowering blood sugar by 3%-6% and fasting insulin levels by 20%-31%, which should protect against type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\n3. INFLAMMATION\r\nSome studies show reductions in markers of inflammation, a key driver of many chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n4. HEART HEALTH\r\nIntermittent fasting may reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, inflammatory markers, blood sugar and insulin resistance – all risk factors for heart disease.\r\n\r\n5. CANCER\r\nAnimal studies suggest that intermittent fasting may prevent cancer.\r\n\r\n6. BRAIN HEALTH\r\nIntermittent fasting can extend lifespan in rats. Studies showed that fasted rats lived 36-83% longer.\r\n\r\n7. ANTI-AGING \r\nIntermittent fasting can extend lifespan in rats. Studies showed that fasted rats lived 36-83% longer.\r\n\r\n**Keep in mind that research is still in its early stages. Many of the studies were small, short-term or conducted in animals. Many questions have yet to be answered in higher qualified human studies.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nIntermittent fasting is certainly not for everyone. If you’re underweight or have a history of eating disorders, you should not fast without consulting with a health professional first. In these cases, it can be downright harmful.",

            "Game features are really good and detailed. The more I play, the more features I get to discover. Joining alliance and battling with others felt the most innovative and interesting, not to mention making friends and allies just as your game character. There are different means to earn golds too which is rare. There was a huge glitch problem which wasn't allowing me to play for more than a minute or two, but thanks to the developers, it's now solved fully and I can play freely and smoothly.",
            "Really fun game! Different from how it was advertised though, but it's ok. I've been playing for around 157days, and I've been active daily. Many people commented that it's a game that requires money to achieve high ranks, but that's not really true. As long as u put ur resources in the right places, n during events, u'll be able to rank well! Like within the top 100. It's fun to challenge myself n c how high a rank I can go without paying a single cent. :) It's nice to chat with other players!",
            "Money-hungry. Servers die less than a year. I like this game because I met a lot of people and able to be friends with. I do still enjoy this game. The issue is that it really, really, really is a pay-to-win. CME will milk everything they have to offer. They even tweaked the algorithm to give out fewer shards during events. Emperor shards are even more difficult now to get. I have four decent VIP accounts (unlocked all quick buttons) on different servers. Is it worth your money? Definitely not.",
            "Just had the new update and it's disappointing tbh. I get that the game needs to come up with ways to make money so that it can keep giving out great content but can CME at least not make the events even more difficult than they already are. It's true that if you play regularly you will be rewarded but it's tiring and now I'm kind of fed up. Before update I could at least play my favourite Jade for Beauty with ease but now it's a CS event and I've got to be here at all hours to keep up rank.",
            "The new art academy to get a superheroine is a joke. You can't call that a game! I don't have a problem with the cost (even though it's absurdly expensive, it takes $500-$2,000 real money to get a superheroine). My problem is how completely boring it is to \"play\" that art academy \"game\" It just spams world chat with notifications from other players. No one in our cross servers likes the game. Reaction was 1/10, everyone hates it. Who approved of this dumb idea? We need more actual FUN mini games"
