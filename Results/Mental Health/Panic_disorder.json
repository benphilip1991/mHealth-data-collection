            "Finally! An app that meets my simple needs! All I personally need is an app for breathing that i can change the pacing on, cheap or free. After about 12 apps, i had yet to find one where i could adjust the speed of the breathing prompts. My lungs are not in awesome shape, so i just cant maintain the ultra slow pace without getting light headed and more anxious because i need oxygen. This one lets me decide how long to breathe in, out, and set the pause! Its exactly what i needed!",
            "Every so often run across an app that just gets it right. This is simple and easy to use. Very helpful with just enough info to help and not add to the Webmd oh my God I'm dying mindset. Color is very important with anxiety. Being able to customize the app is another example of great user experience.",
            "It's not easy, but this app trains you to experience and understand the fear and anxiety of a panic attack. It's scary as hell, but then you realize that you were in control the whole time. That's the secret, you're always in control! Once you learn not to let it progress, you feel better. Amazing app, I love it.",
            "Amazing I followed there steps and it stopped my panic attack so fast like 15 min that's amazing since my panic attacks usually last 40 to 60 min the first one that actually helps it's not just breathing exercises it has other ways to I only download it because I was having one but I'm definitely keeping it now",
            "Great app for therapy clients, good info and easy to use. Suggestion: Is it possible to develop a 'panic button' widget that takes you straight to the breathing circle? One less barrier to accessing it easily when needed."

            "I have only been using this app for a few days and it has been very helpful. The meditations and breathing exercises are short and sweet with option sound and vibrations to help keep you on task. I am very happy with the journal as well! I like the option to pick emotion stickers for the day and answer simple questions vs freestyle (although you have 2000 characters for that too).",
            "I've been using this app for a little under a week and have been finding it pretty helpful so far. Haven't had the need to try out the panic button yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the rest of the app seems helpful. That said, I am very confused as to how I can have a \"20 day Journal streak\" when I've only had the app for about five days. It's doesn't impact the function at all, but it is a very strange glitch on the gameification side of things.",
            "I have read through the information provided and found it very useful. It is very clear and easy to understand how to use the app. Even though I haven't yet taken out their paid subscription, there are still activities you can do for free. I have found so far, this to be the best Anxiety/Panic Attack App I've come across.",
            "Absolutely love this app. Would be rad if there was a chatbot like woebot or self-education quizzes to help understand ourselves & our issues. Only thing I'd change is hiding the stuff only paid users can access. Maybe prevent accidently clicking on a premium feature by having all the free features in 1 area? Being reminded we're too poor to access features that could help us, is depressing & anxiety provoking.",
            "Had an issue signing up but the rootd IT team was quick to resolve my issue. The app is very helpful and I would certainly recommend it to others that are struggling with anxiety and panic attacks."

I don't know who's voice that is but it's so soothing and makes me unwind instantly! Don't change a thing! Thank you to the creators of this app. It's been a God send for my healing from anxiety.",
            "I've been on a severe anxiety attack that went on for 3 days. I was considering hypnosis through a consultant but stumbled upon this app. I paid the extra $$ to move the hypno sound all the way up and to put it on loop so it can play while I'm asleep. After the 1st night of listening my anxiety attack was 70% gone. 2nd night no anxiety. I've downloaded a couple of other hypnosis apps, self esteem, fear and exercise. *UPDATE* It'd be great if I could play all of the apps i unlocked while I sleep",
            "Free yet not free. Although it said the app was free, once you try it, you discover many features are not available until you upgrade to a paid version, never mentioned on the download page. It was impossible to evaluate with so many features unusable.",
            "This had become 1 of my go-to apps at the end of the day. If you don't over expect any sudden results. I just allow it to give me at least 30 min of mindfulness. When used at night I do find I sleep better.",
            "Thankful that it doesn't ask for personal details (name, age, address etc) great job 👍 wish more apps were like this. Straight to the point"

Its helped me be able to practice breathing techniques without the app.",

I know you can't die from panic attacks but it sure does feel like it, and this app did an amazing job on helping me with me breathing! I don't know what else to say! If anyone is looking for a good app to help you through your panic attacks, this is the app! Again, thanks so much for this app! You're an amazing human being for making this app",
            "I just used this app for the first time and it's absolutely fantastic! I have anxiety and am trying to work on my breathing. My son and daughter have Aspergers syndrome and I am going to suggest it for them too. Because it's so visual...I feel positive that it will work to calm them too. Thank you so much.",
            "I'd like a longer or different one. i think a few more selections make it easy to know which exercise to use for the proper moment. each attack is different at times. it started to work but the short length for me was the only downfall. i will keep it and see how it progresses."

            "I really like this app! I has really helped me and it is comforting to know if I start feeling panic or a surplus of negative anxiety that this app is right here for me. However, I cant figure out how to create an account/log in. When I click Sign In it takes me to the menu of choosing one of the four things to do. Does anyone have any tips?",
            "It really helps with my anxiety attacks and panic episodes. My only complaint is I find the breathing pattern in the panic pattern to be a little unnatural. It asks you to inhale for a short amount of time, and then exhale for a long time, and then hold it for a long time.",
            "Love the app, but I can't sign in to modify patterns. Nothing happens when I press the sign in link. I've paid for the app so would appreciate a look taken at this. Bar that excellent app.",
            "Okay, so I am struggling with anxiety, and this app really helps! The one thing I don't really like about it is you would have to pay to be able to choose a different pattern in Panic Patterns. But I kind of like the pattern already on it, and it is definitely worth downloading if you are struggling with immense fear and anxiety.",
            "Good overall. I do have one complaint. I really wish the pattern stayed at a steady pace instead of speeding up and slowing down. It's frustrating. Not calming."

            "I really enjoyed the app it is great to relax to, I used it after having a big day and now I feel so much better. I really loved the night beach scene it was very authentic the cracking of the fire is amazing. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is anxious or just someone wanting to relax and distress. It is great to use at night to help you sleep it helped to turn off the mind and put relaxing thoughts I your head to help you drop off to sleep.",
            "Actually I really like this app. It goes beyond the typical audio by giving you a sense of place as well through visual guidance and scene setting. Great for when I need a clear head when I am creating artwork or when trying to get my kids prepared for bed. Great app, great concept.",
            "Love this app ! So simple to use and yet very powerful. In our hectic lifestyle, we all need to take some time out to relax. And this app makes relaxing a breeze.",
            "Great relaxation app. Only took a few minutes to quiet the mind, much needed during times of stress.",

It has helped me so much with my panic attacks and anxiety reducing the impacts to managing my Diabetes. I have highly recommended this app to my doctor, friends and my psychologist to help other people in my local community of regional Sydney Australia. A huge thank you to the Dare team :)",
            "I must say that it's a great app and great initiative by the team , we live in a busy world n everyone is busy with themselves , but anxiety , crisis , depression are not rare , n even our dear ones sometimes do not constantly have the time to listen to our worries n be there for us , so this is where help like this is very important , i listened 4-5 audios n I m already feeling calm , n from now on I m gonna just put this on n drive away my anxiety n fears , I think it will be possible , thanku",
            "Amazing App to help you conquer anxiety! Barry has a soothing voice and his audios are outstanding! I am so happy that I stumbled on this app. The content is extensive and super helpful. The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",

            "A good app for very basic, grounded challenges people with simple lives might face. It's very lacking, however, when it comes to greater, more complex, interconnected challenges. At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",

I haven't been using this for long, but I have a feeling this will change your life for the better if you using it regularly and take advantage of the resources on this app.",

        "description": "The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\r\n\r\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\r\n\r\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

        "description": "Anxiety symptoms can last for a long time, or come and go.\r\n\r\nEach anxiety disorder has unique symptoms. Anxiety disorders are typically diagnosed when fear of non-threatening situations, places, events, or objects becomes extreme and uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nAn anxiety disorder may also be diagnosed if you have general feelings of fear or worry that interfere with your daily life and have lasted at least six months.\r\n\r\nMost people with an anxiety disorder have a combination of physical and psychological symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere is one symptom that all anxiety disorders have in common: near-constant fear or worry about things that may happen to you now or in the future. Read on to learn what the symptoms are and how to diagnose anxiety disorders.\r\n\r\nSome studies suggest that experiencing anxiety could increase the risk of developing certain long-term physical health problems, including diabetes, stomach ulcers and heart problems. But there's not enough evidence to say for sure exactly what the risks are, or what groups of people are most likely to be affected. Having a physical illness or disability can also make you feel stressed and anxious, so it might sometimes feel like your anxiety problems and physical health problems are part of a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nSometimes it might be difficult to work out whether your symptoms are totally related to anxiety, or might be related to a different illness. If you're experiencing any physical symptoms it's best to talk to your GP, so they can check out what may be causing them.\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Anxiety or Panic Attacks?\r\nWhat we think of as anxiety attacks are actually panic attacks. A panic attack is the sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort that peaks after about ten minutes, and it typically lasts no longer than 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nResearchers think that panic attacks come about because the brain is telling the body that the fight-or-flight response, which includes a rapid heartbeat and shallow breathing, should kick in, even though there may be no threat at all. Scientists also theorize that the amygdala, which is the brain's fear processing hub, may also be activated during a panic attack.\r\n\r\nPanic attacks may come on because of a particular event, or they may come on for no reason at all. It's been estimated that almost 23 percent of people will have at least one panic attack in their lifetime.\r\n\r\nIf your panic attacks are recurring, you are likely to be diagnosed with panic disorder. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder thats characterized by persistent worry about future panic attacks or their consequences.",

Kurze und prägnante Anweisungen helfen Ihnen bei der Bewältigung einer Angstattacke oder Panikattacke und verhindern so unnötigen psychischen und physischen Stress.\r\n\r\nAlles was Sie dafür benötigen, ist Ihr Smartphone und ggf. ein paar Kopfhörer. \r\nAußergewöhnlich ist, dass diese App Sie auf Basis eines Konfrontationstrainings in Ihrer persönlichen Angst und Panik begleitet und Sie mit verhaltenstherapeutischen Mitteln aus der Angst- oder Panikattacke herausholt.\r\n\r\nDie Wirkung einer Konfrontation mit Angst und Panik ist vielfach wissenschaftlich belegt und führt bei ca. 80% der Angst- und Panikbetroffenen mit spezifischen und unspezifischen Ängsten oder einer Panikstörung oder Angststörung und bei Menschen mit Phobien zu einer erheblichen Verbesserung oder einem kompletten Rückgang der Beschwerden.\r\n\r\nHierbei vermeidet man keine beängstigenden Situationen und körperlichen Empfindungen, sondern stellt sich diesen bewusst und lässt die Angst und Panik zu. \r\nZiel ist es, jegliche Ablenkung und jegliches Vermeidungs- und Sicherheitsverhalten zu unterbinden und so geistig und körperlich zu erfahren, dass das Befürchtete nicht eintritt. Die Angst vor der Angst wird abgebaut und das Vertrauen in den eigenen Körper kommt zurück.\r\n\r\nNeben dem Konfrontationstraining finden Sie außerdem eine Vielzahl von individuell gestalteten Audiodateien zur Stressreduktion und Entspannung  in Form von geführten Meditationen, Achtsamkeitsübungen und Naturklängen, sowie nützlichen Informationen rund um das Thema Angst und Panik, deren Gründe und was man als Betroffener und Angehöriger von Betroffenen dagegen tun kann. \r\n\r\nKonfrontationstraining, Meditation & Achtsamkeit – Ihre Begleiter auf dem Weg aus Angst und Panik.\r\n\r\nKeine Panik bietet Ihnen:\r\n\r\nSTANDARDVERSION:\r\n☆ kostenlos und werbefrei\r\n☆ Panik Tagebuch\r\n☆ umfangreiche wissenschaftliche Informationen zum Thema Angst- und Panikerkrankung\r\n☆ die 4-2-8 Atemtechnik\r\n☆ Podcast \"Das Wesen der Panik\"\r\n☆ Hilfestellung zur optimaten Verhaltensweise während einer Panikattacke/Angstanfall\r\n☆ Selbsttest auf Panikstörung\r\n☆ Informationen für Angehörige von Betroffenen\r\n\r\n \r\nPREMIUMVERSION:\r\n★ kostenpflichtig und werbefrei\r\n★ Gemeinsam aus der Panik - Audiodatei zum Durchstehen während einer Panikattacke\r\n★ Hilfe bei Panik - Audiodatei zur Selbsthilfe während einer Panikattacke\r\n★ Hilfe bei Panik kurz - Audiodatei mit kurzen, prägnanten Anweisungen zur Selbsthilfe während einer Panikattacke\r\n★ geführte Meditation \"Atemmeditation\"\r\n★ geführte Meditation \"7-Punkte-Meditation\"\r\n★ Meditation ohne Anleitung \"Klangschalenmeditation\"\r\n★ Audiodatei mit Waldgeräuschen zur Entspannung\r\n★ Audiodatei mit Meeresgeräuschen zur Entspannung\r\n★ Audiodatei mit Regengeräuschen zur Entspannung\r\n★ Nach dem erstmaligen Benutzen laufen die Audiodateien komplett OFFLINE\r\n★ Ausgewählte Audiodateien mit Auswahl von männlicher oder weiblicher Stimme\r\n★ Frei einstellbare, entspannende Hintergrundmusik\r\n★ Regelmäßige Podcasts rund ums Thema Angst & Panik\r\n★ KEIN ABO!\r\n★ Einmal freischalten und immer alle Audiodateien nutzen, einschließlich ALLER zukünftigen Audiodateien\r\n\r\nDATENSCHUTZ\r\nhttps://www.body-and-mind-meditation.de/app_pages/datenschutz.html\r\n\r\nAGB\r\nhttps://www.body-and-mind-meditation.de/app_pages/agb.html\r\n\r\nHAFTUNGSAUSSCHLUSS\r\nhttps://www.body-and-mind-meditation.de/app_pages/haftungsausschluss.html\r\n\r\nBeugen Sie Stress, Burnout und Depression vor und verhindern Sie Angst und Panik durch eine gesunde Lebensweise.

I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

        "description": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is an anxiety disorder characterized by a significant amount of fear in one or more social situations, causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some parts of daily life. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others.\r\nPhysical symptoms often include excessive blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Stammering may be present, along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common for sufferers of social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion, especially if they are undiagnosed, untreated, or both; this can lead to alcoholism, eating disorders or other kinds of substance abuse. SAD is sometimes referred to as an illness of lost opportunities where \"individuals make major life choices to accommodate their illness\".  According to ICD-10 guidelines, the main diagnostic criteria of social phobia are fear of being the focus of attention, or fear of behaving in a way that will be embarrassing or humiliating, avoidance and anxiety symptoms. Standardized rating scales can be used to screen for social anxiety disorder and measure the severity of anxiety.",

The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and last for more than six months. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations.

Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Its very easy to use and gives you direct straightforward questions and answers. You will never regret downloading it. I highly recommend this app to anyone who needs it. Its a very useful and helpful app tool. It'll give you a more a positive view of yourself and of your mental state. A hugh thankyou to the creators, especially for allowing it free",

            "I like how every area of this app is straight forward; even the questionnaire is direct and effective. There are SEVERAL DIFFERENT topics to êxplore! The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",
            "I have shared it with friends already. It's great. Retake tests compare the results to each one. Keeps a journal. Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

Also the mindfulness section only has 4 things to look at, it would be nice if more were added.",
            "i used clear fear for a while now and im so glad i found it because its really helping. i would give 5 stars if there wasnt this little problem that gets super annoying after while. if you log into the app the first time you answer some questions like selecting which part of the world ur from, set ur passcode and a security question and all of that stuff and i confirmed everything but if i open the app i have to answer all of the questions again, like i havent answered them. please fix that!!",
            "Good app, just two notes. When I try to type a text I cannot scrol the screen down enough to keep seeing the textbox. It disappears behind my keyboard. And I would like some excercises in it that are also in calm harm. It seems that app contains more coping strategies than just cbt and a breathing excercise it also has more interaction than clear fear. But it is a bit weird to read about harm when it is about anxiety. Another option would be to choose in the harm app what one is using it for.",
            "This was an ok app but there are only two things you can do to calm you down. A breathing activity and the same recording of a person telling you how to calm down. Other than that it's just an app to write down goals. There is also no option to record an attack after it happened and instead you must go through one of the activities and say that it helped so that you can record something. Even then it'll not show up for awhile until the week ends. There could be many improvements but its ok.",
            "I was recommended to this application by my therapist, and found the resources in this application helpful. However, I do realise that there is a bug that doesn't save your information when you close out of the application. Therefore, I would have to manually key in all my details from startup again. Other than the issue I mentioned, the application overall is great."

With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",

Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",

My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

            "This app is quiet helpful. At first when I tried the app I wasnt taking it seriously but when I opened up to it to see if it would help it has helped me a bit. I have really bad anxiety, generalized/health anxiety and majority of the time I forget to get on the app but when I do I feel more relieved and have my thoughts more collected than out of control all over the place. I dont pay the app for special exercises or anything and it good.",
            "They say the free version has several exercises, but when I entered my mood info, a message said, 'you aren't having negative thoughts so try one of our many activities.' But ALL activities were locked. And ALL 'Guides' were locked. There were no exercises for me to use. How can I decide to go Premium if I can't try anything in the free version first? I don't like giving low ratings before contacting the developer first - but I could not find any contact info anywhere - another pet peeve.",
            "It's not accurate to say you have a choice of exercises. Unless you pay, you get one exercise, whether it's one you like or not. The exercises are nice, but this app has nothing BUT its 11 exercises, and charges as much as apps with a whole library of meditations and tools. It's enjoyable to use but they are asking a ridiculous price for so little content compared to the competitors.",
            "I got mind ease early and was gifted a full subscription! I really enjoy the full experience and It has helped me manage my anxiety really well. The calm me function is really cool and helps give you an experience tailored to what you're feeling without you having to pick it in your moment of panic which is a great feature. I hope by this time next year I will financially be able to continue my subscription because it is well worth the money imo!",
            "I was halfway through the very first pre exercise and I felt so much better. Towards the end I had a slight emotional release, which was very much needed and I am still genuinely surprised. I cannot wait to dive deeper into this app. Thank you so much for creating this, it is truly going to help a lot of people!"

I loved this app and it genuinely helped me through very tough times, but the latest update has replaced the recording and this now isn't particularly pleasant at all ☹️ too fast, not soft and gentle, and the music is too faint to be audible. absolutely gutted! Wish there was a way to get the old recording back, with the music as well.",

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

It tracks when you take medicine or drugs. This is the simplest app without losing functionality. Exactly what you want if you are trying to work with a psychiatrist OR manage mental health on your own. (screw moodpath lol)",
            "I love this app for tracking my moods. With bipolar two disorder, I can combine the info I track here with my fitbit sleep tracker data to provide my psychiatrist with a comprehensive look at my progress with respect to hypomanic and depressive episodes. My only complaint is the graphs. I would like to be able to change or customize how I see the data so I can better analyze trends.",
            "Exactly what you would expect it to do. Log your Moods. Edit: I have used it near every day since I downloaded 2 months ago. They say to gain power over your demons, you must name them. If you make it a habit to recognize your feelings and label them, you will feel better. Just taking the time to jot a few things down will help tremendously. I cannot suggest this app enough. And the custom reminders are beautiful. A notification to be mindful for two minutes? I couldn't ask for more.",

It's in a quick, easy to use, yet sufficiently detailed format. I best love that I can put in my own notes as short or as long as I want. I don't need the complicated graphs I saw in other apps. The simple words that I use to describe myself in this app best meet my needs and allow me to more clearly convey my life to my doctor and counselor."

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

        "description": "How to Overcome Anxiety is an application that helps you to overcome disruptions in your life Anxiety is a condition that usually arises with excess stress and worry. It is usually the feared possibility of the consequences of an action that brings about anxiety. The people who get anxious are always worrying about the bad things that might happen and thus create an environment of fear in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nin this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nDealing with depression\r\nFight Depression Naturally\r\nhow to deal with depression\r\nhow to overcome depression\r\nhow to deal with stress\r\nhow to deal with anger\r\nhow to deal with anxiety\r\ndealing with anxiety\r\nhow to deal with a breakup\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about How to Overcome Anxiety \r\n\r\nIf you want to know how to overcome anxiety, you must be quick to notice what wrong with you and what you need to do to correct it.\r\n\r\nIt is wise you quickly learn how to overcome anxiety now otherwise you will continue to feel stressed, unhappy and anxious throughout your life. You will suffer unduly because anxiety will weaken you mentally, sap your energy and you will not be at your best. Anxiety comes in many forms. Some suffer from panic disorder where there are unpredictable attacks of panic on the person, with its physiological consequences, while some others feel helpless in an embarrassing situation and this is agoraphobia. There are also others suffering from various other phobias like fear of heights, insects and water. Some feel that they are always watched by others, and thus suffer from social anxiety disorder. People who have undergone some traumatic event in their past suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Some people perform repeated and ritualistic behaviors to rid themselves of obsessive compulsive disorders and the most common form of anxiety is generalized anxiety disorder. These people are usually over anxious of a situation and may end up in some major depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, anxiety comes in many forms, and the first step to be taken in the treatment of anxiety lies in finding out what the cause is. Once the reason of the anxiety has been found out, it proves to be rather easy to cure anxiety. It is best to avoid these situations as much as possible in the beginning of your treatment so that there is no feeling of anxiety at all.\r\n\r\nIt may be needed to approach a psychiatrist to help in the treatment of anxiety. Under their guidance, you learn to handle anxiety attacks in three steps; before, during and after the anxiety attack.\r\n\r\nA person who suffers from anxiety should not set self-defeating goals. It is instead better to set productive and possible goals that improve one's thought and action. With this step, the patient learns to gain better control over oneself and thus overcome anxiety. When suffering from a bout of anxiety, it is better to calm oneself naturally rather than trying to fight or control one's anxious feelings.\r\n\r\nSomeone with anxiety should work at producing positive thoughts in the mind. Once pessimistic or unpleasant thoughts enter the mind, it is better to divert oneself and think of other situations with vivid, optimistic pictures. If possible, it proves to be better to think positive thought of these pessimistic thoughts, using objective words.",

These people are usually over anxious of a situation and may end up in some major depressive disorder.<br><br>As it can be seen, anxiety comes in many forms, and the first step to be taken in the treatment of anxiety lies in finding out what the cause is. Once the reason of the anxiety has been found out, it proves to be rather easy to cure anxiety. It is best to avoid these situations as much as possible in the beginning of your treatment so that there is no feeling of anxiety at all.<br><br>It may be needed to approach a psychiatrist to help in the treatment of anxiety. Under their guidance, you learn to handle anxiety attacks in three steps; before, during and after the anxiety attack.<br><br>A person who suffers from anxiety should not set self-defeating goals. It is instead better to set productive and possible goals that improve one&#39;s thought and action. With this step, the patient learns to gain better control over oneself and thus overcome anxiety. When suffering from a bout of anxiety, it is better to calm oneself naturally rather than trying to fight or control one&#39;s anxious feelings.<br><br>Someone with anxiety should work at producing positive thoughts in the mind. Once pessimistic or unpleasant thoughts enter the mind, it is better to divert oneself and think of other situations with vivid, optimistic pictures. If possible, it proves to be better to think positive thought of these pessimistic thoughts, using objective words.",

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "Honestly, you can't do much without paying £3+. Even small, petty things like leave the music playing after the spoken meditation/hypnosis has finished. Or even more petty, turn off the 'wake up' sound at the end. You have to pay if you want to turn that off. All a bit pathetic. The meditation/hypnosis itself is nice, a decent length with a soothing background. You have to listen each time to a whole speech on how it works first, unless, of course, you pay to get rid of it.",
            "This is a great app! The background music is wonderful. It's very relaxing and calming. I have been searching for some way to be happy, and calm again, for two years now. Because of this app, I got to expirience that, so thank you. I would very much recommend this to anyone who is seeing this.",

            "Relaxed, simple voice instruction is used to reach a suggestible hypnotic mindset. There is a number countup from 1 to 10 as you are physically and mentally relaxed by the narrator's pleasant voice. Then generally positive messages are introduced.",
            "Thank you so much for this app! I am going through the most critical stage of life where i couldn't sleep for a week straught due to my anxiety and depression. This application literally helped me in sleeping better last night. Thank you so much for this application again. Spending a few bucks to buy it was worth it!"

        "description": "Features: \r\n• Enter your own personal fear \r\n• Create a fear hierarchy\r\n• Complete exposure tasks while live updating your anxiety levels\r\n\r\nEffective against: \r\n• Phobias (snakes, spiders, heights, flying, etc.)\r\n• Social anxiety disorder\r\n• Post-traumatic stress disorder\r\n• Panic disorder\r\n• Generalized anxiety disorder\r\n• Obsessive-compulsive disorders \r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nExposure therapy is one of psychology's greatest, most effective treatment tools that have been discovered over the past few decades. A key technique in behavior therapy for anxiety, exposure therapy involves gradually exposing someone to their feared object, situation, or task without any danger in order to overcome their anxiety. This app enables people to go through exposure therapy.\r\n\r\nBefore exposure, users first create a fear hierarchy - a list of activities that induce anxiety ranked from highest to lowest. Then, they work through the activities in the fear hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-inducing activity and working their way up.\r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. \r\n\r\nDetailed Guide: \r\nMany people with phobias recognize their fear as illogical, but their mind is still afraid nonetheless. This is because the primal fear centers of our mind act subconsciously whenever it spots anything it thinks is dangerous (such as lions or snakes) in order to escape immediately. However, in today's modern society when we don't have to worry about predators eating us, our minds can often trigger false alarms to things that aren't actually dangerous. \r\n\r\nThe fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there. \r\n\r\nTo break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous. The most important principle is to make sure that the fear leaves before you do. \r\n\r\nThis app helps you break the fear. First, add what you are afraid of and then construct a list of activities that will induce various levels of anxiety. Then, you can start exposing yourself by doing these activities starting from what gives you the least amount of anxiety. During the exposure process, you can track your anxiety levels by updating it continuously, and finish when it falls to 20/100 or lower. As you work your away through the activities, your fear should continue to fall! \r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. If you leave the activity before your anxiety falls, then this will actually reinforce your fear instead of lowering it. Try starting with the easiest activity first. Going straight to a challenging task might actually increase your fear. It is very difficult to stay in a situation when your entire body is screaming at you to leave, especially if there is no person there coaxing you to stay and wait.",

It helped because if not it might have led to an anxiety attack and/or mental breakdown.",
            "Love all of them, especially the anxiety one but I wish it didn't have those few spots where the sound breaks, and mine won't loop so it should have a timer so you can do longer than 10 minutes.",
            "i get really bad tic attacks because of anxiety and the anxiety one doesnt work but the adhd one helps so much thank you",
            "I love it, I use the anxiety track and it actually does make me feel more calm most the time. Only thing that would be nice was if you could have the option for a timer. For example if I wanna play a track on repeat as I try to fall asleep but I don't want it still playing after I fall asleep. So if I could set it to stop playing after an hour or so. That would be great.",
            "I have severe anxiety and a lot of things set me off. One thing I get extremely anxious about is the world ending so hearing rain doesn't calm me at all. It only gives me an anxiety attack. Instead I use the pain reliever music for my anxiety"

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "So far this is excellent. I was recently diagnosed with depression and need to keep track of my symptoms as well as effects of medications. Most of the other apps have a pre-set list of symptoms, and user is limited to those symptoms. This app allows you to create your own labels for symptoms, so you can be very specific with tracking your health issues. Also, the app creates a nice graph for visual representation of your symptoms. This app is exactly what i needed.",

Had to read 100+ reviews to find developer comments to learn how to use, how to edit, etc. A \"how to/help\" in the dropdown menu is missing. Also, haven't yet figured out tracking >1 person. I got this to track my kid but would like to add myself. Overall it works well so far. Also, I haven't upgraded. Access to the full version (3day trial) would probably yield more upgrades. If full is just ad removal I'm ok with ads",

        "description": "There is something in all of us that responds involuntarily to different stressors and the complexity of life which is suggested be the fundamental problem of all mental illnesses. It grows and thrives as a consequence, goes beyond tolerance, making our lives miserable. Lives are complicated and we cannot stay on top of our problems all the time. People are just being hammered in many ways and that lead to their collapse in the direction of their genetic susceptibility and biological weakness.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app is developed as a tool for introspection and will provide you with evidence-based information about emotional problems and mental disorders. It will teach you cognitive behavioural therapy and other self-help methods, and techniques, specifically designed to help with overcoming depression, generalized anxiety and worry, social anxiety and shyness, divorce and separation, loss and bereavement. It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking. Cognitive behavioural therapy is proven to be effective in the long term by applying the techniques and shift the way you think. It can help you find a meaning and purpose, negotiate with yourself and be free from your past. \r\n\r\n“Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind;\r\nFor the soul is dyed by the thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Depression section, you will learn more about psychological, medical and alternative treatments for relief, reduction, prevention and dealing with major depressive disorders, dysthymia, bipolar disorder. By using the self-help methods you can learn helpful ways of thinking, that will help overcome depression now and in the future. It will also help you to practice ways of living your life and relating to people that leave you less vulnerable to depression.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Anxiety and Worry (GAD) section you will have the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and worry and whether you are a worrier. A helpful set of strategies will show you how to deal with the purpose, meaning, and content of your worries. And, at the end, you will have a different perspective on how to manage it. The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you'll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief. Although it's not possible to turn back the clock or remove the fact of a loss, you may find some of these ideas are useful for helping with your grief.\r\n\r\n*The app is not designed to treat clinical levels of depression or anxiety, or other mental health disorders. Further counseling is needed as the diagnosis and treatment require a medical practitioner or a qualified mental health professional.",

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process.  The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.\r\n\r\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest!

            "This is an amazing app for use during virtual therapy sessions with a therapist! ... This app allows me to continue to use EMDR in my therapy sessions, during virtual sessions from home, due to the pandemic. ... I really enjoy the self-led functions for practice and reinforcement of anxiety-relieving behaviors, even when I am not overly stressed, as regular practice ingrains the behaviors so they become automatic in times of duress. ... I was quite relieved at the clear avoidance of faith/ideals or other topics besides simply healing from anxiety, in the sessions. Many other relaxation/calming apps speak of specific body parts (anxiety for an amputee), use religious wording (a trigger for those abused by \"the faithful\"), or visualization guidance that may contain phobias.This was what led me to believe that there were careful, thoughtful, conscientious mental health professionals involved in the creation of this healing tool. ... I told my therapist about this after I evaluated it's functions, and he is very excited to review it himself from a more clinical standpoint, with the intention of possibly suggesting it to his other virtual patients! ... To suggest an improvement; I would like to see a stereoscopic add-on for this app, as it would allow for distraction-free immersive VR functionality with even the most basic of headsets such as Google Cardboard, a huge boon for those of us with high distractability. I would accept this add-on as a micro-transaction within the app. I would suggest another improvement as well, buy my ideas have tangible value. ... (\"...\" Added to signify between paragraphs, as the review form turned my review into a difficult-to-read wall of text.",
            "Amazing app but please, please, get rid of or at least lower that guitar that comes on at the end of each session. I end each session feeling amazing then that guitar jarringly blares in my ear and undoes the relaxation. Begging the devs to edit the audio and remove or dramatically lower the guitar, I'd give 5 stars",
            "Wow! What an amazing app and process. For those of us without reasonable access to EMDR therapists, this app is perfect. Even the guided meditations alone are the best I've come across. I hope to see some more added later. I was 100% ready to mess with this app for about 5 minutes and then hit Refund. After giving it ago, hell i would pay way more for this level of content and the result I get! Thank you a million times for this hidden gem!",
            "Skeptical Until I Tried It... This app has helped me get over panic attacks (and anxiety attacks) in the moment they begin. It takes practice and patience but it worked for me. The guided eye movements with noise ear to ear....I know it's science...but I couldn't believe the state I was in after 5-10 minutes. This may be for you and it may not. We're all different, but as it's free, it's worth a shot. The first time I used this I was anxiety riddled on a plane and it got me through.",

            "The app is great. If you pay for the non free parts it would be a better experience. I'm currently using the free section but helps as have to think and find the positive in the day and why do I think its happend. It helps to re read when going through a rough day and realising that you have more good days if you find the good.",

All this combines with a colorful, almost whimsical user interface that is simultaneously easy to navigate and visually appealing and calming.",

            "I love this app but one of the main paid features does not work. I want to download my entries to send to my therapist but the report output is incorrect. The emotions don't match with the correct day, the time of the entries show only the time you downloaded the report and it doesn't include any of the recorded cognitive dysfunctions I logged. I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",
            "Thus far, I say that this app was perfectly created! So far, what I've seen is very well organized & contains helpful lessons, informational videos, a personal journal, and more! This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

Beware, even some of the most downloaded apps make this mistake!\r\nBreath Ball's breathing is based on clinical observations of hundreds of humans. The app was specifically designed for clinical environments. That's why Breath Balls breathing exercises feel natural and work much better than any of the competing apps.\r\n⭐️ No quackery: Breath Ball is based on sound scientific research. New breathing exercises are added only when there is sufficient research data available.\r\nHowever, you can of course define your own breathing exercises and use Breath Ball for whatever you want.\r\n⭐️ Maximum customizability: Our well being highly depends on what we like and dislike. Breath Ball is the only app you can fully customize to your liking: Colors, breathing exercises and even the size of the user interface can be adjusted to give you the breathing app that feels just right for you.\r\n⭐️ Focus on simplicity: Breath Ball is incredibly easy to use and even the first breathing session usually leads to great results.\r\n⭐️ Free: Even the free version of Breath Ball provides all the functionality you'll ever need.\r\n\r\nThese are the main reasons why leading medical professionals, therapists and biofeedback coaches use and recommend Breath Ball.\r\n\r\nWhat is Breath Ball used for?\r\nBreath Ball helps you to relieve stress and anxiety, soothe the symptoms of COPD and Asthma, lower high blood pressure and overcome sleeplessness with four easy breathing exercises. What might sound too simple to be true, is actually based on latest scientific research and is used to treat patients at rehab facilities and in clinical environments. So let's take a closer look at Breath Ball's breathing exercises and what they can do for you:\r\n\r\nBreath Ball provides breathing exercises for these four use cases:\r\n\r\n⭐️ The cardiac coherence breathing exercise is used to relieve stress and anxiety. It is thought to patients at rehab and bio-feedback trainings to help them get calm and relax.\r\n\r\n⭐️ The COPD foundation’s recommended breathing technique helps to relieve the\r\nsymptoms of Asthma and COPD.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Slow paced breathing is a complementary treatment against hypertension (high blood pressure). It goes back to Prof. Dr. Loew and is commonly used in clinical environments.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Dr. Andrew Weil’s famous 4:7:8 breathing technique is used to get calm to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nEach of these breathing exercises comes with a short tutorial that will get you started in less than two minutes. Beside that you can create your own breathing exercises; something yoga and pranayama coaches enjoy a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy concerns?\r\nPlease note: We truly value your privacy.

I find it helpful and I think it has a great Foundation to be a frontrunner. I specifically like the breathing bar although only comes with premium. I like being able to change the colors making it easier on my eyes and less stressful to use. I also like the defined breathing exercises for Sleep stress COPD excetera. But the app needs work.",
            "Awesome customisable app,only thing missing is dark mode and import own background sounds in case one doesn't like the ones there/for variety.Maybe the white screen should have some pastel colours with shades changing as the ball moves? Upon completion of a longer time maybe an encouraging message like \"well done or you've improved \" to encourage people to return to the app? So good I recommended it to a friend who enjoys it :D thank you so much makers of this app !!😊 No account needed,yay !",
            "This app has potential, but presently has annoying glitches: 1) has several audible glitches in the audio (inhale and exhale cues), 2) no delayed start is available, 3) always asks confirmation before exiting (it should not do this unkess you are in the middle of a session. It should also provide the option to turn this confirmation off.)",
            "Visual of ball and adjustment of timing is great. But the audio glitches that make a crackling sound every time the audio cue happens makes this app unusable with the sound on. Yes, you can just turn the audio guide off, but the audio guide, without the glitches, would really add to the meditative experience and would allow you to not have to be looking at the ball 100% of the time."

            "I love the app, but I can't figure out how to sustain for more than 99 seconds. Maybe someone could take a breather and tell me. I'm sorry for not being more clear in my review. I'm trying to edit \"Tummo\" to do the \"Wim Hoff\" method. When I go to \"ratio of breath cycle\", it only goes up to 99 seconds. How do I make it go longer? I think it has something to do with \"seconds per ratio unit\" but I'm sort of confused. I was good at math in college, but that was over 50 years ago. Things are getting more discombobulated with age.",
            "All i needed to commit to a regular breathing practice is right here within this app. The wiki has been a very valuable resource to learn about breath work, how to practice, as well as the form and function of the app. I literally love this app and use it every day. It has certainly been one of the keys to help me create personal transform.",
            "I love this app and the paid version is so worth having. Breathwork is increasingly important in my self-care routine and I've just reincorporated this app into it, and I'm so glad I did. A little bit tricky to twiddle with if you're setting up custom breathing patterns but that's because you need to think about them mathematically, so not an issue with the app at all!",
            "Dear Oleksandr, there should be a way to hear the phase transition only once, instead of twice when it alternates between exhale and inhale. ie. I am inhaling for 5 seconds and 5 seconds exhale. I only want to hear phase transition once, after every 10 seconds, instead of every 5 seconds. there is no way to do this currently since exhale or inhale cannot be set to 0, but retain and sustain can be set to 0. When I am listening to this for hours in the background, less noise helps. Thanks.",
            "It is the best app out there. I have never written a recommendation before, but this app deserves it. I have trouble counting the seconds of my breathing while doing it and this app has sound effects so even with closed eyes you know when to inhale, hold, exhale. It has different techniques and I also customised to my way in the free version. It is really the best. Can't recommend it enough. Just download it!"

As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

Also, some sort of progress bar to visually complement the countdown would be nice and help me stay focused. PS. Kudos to the dev for being receptive & swift to act on feedback!",

The app seems a wee bit clunky, but that's alright as it's a new app as of writi this review. We all need some meditation app. This a good one, a one time fee is great.",

The subscription prices are reasonable and I would advocate for it if you like the free dailey morning audio meditations and readings, I love it that it has audio meditations, check-ins, a calendar to track progress, noon and bedtime meditations, and a library However, I would appreciate the ability to use the same subscription for the Android and iPhone so that progress can be synched between devices. Thank you.",
            "I'm in love with this app for so many reasons. I love the gentle nudges that keep me coming back, the enormous amount of support I feel with being given options to journal or talk it out, and most importantly that the voices I hear are from BIPOC.",
            "I try to use this app every morning to start the day. It has a variety of deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, positive affirmations, and much more. They tailor to your needs based on the questionnaire given at the beginning. I'm enjoying this app so far!",
            "This is a great app for supporting mental health and the challenges we face in modern life. It is my go to app for stress and anxiety relief. The fact that it exists lets me know I am not alone, I am part of a community of people who experience the world as it is and are working to make it live up to its promise. Thank you Shine!",
            "I like what I see in the free version even though most features are locked for premium. Unfortunately I will be uninstalling because at $54 a year it's a little expensive for me but I am sure it would be worth it. Great app overall."

Maybe it's because I end it 5 seconds early or something, but I wish there was a way I could like hold down on the segment and say \"mark as complete\" or something.",

I regret that I bought a subscription, which is very expensive compared to other meditation apps",

            "I really like this app. There are a wide variety of available sessions and i enjoy being able to put in my emotions and have a list of tailored sessions. I have two recommendations: the first is to be able to search for sessions by name or topic, and the second is to have the option put in the goal of the session instead of/in addition to your emotions, to help the list of sessions be even more tailored to you. I also wish the voices were a bit more soothing (slower/calmer/quieter/gentler)",
            "I love using the meditation timer on this app. It has guided meditation as well as timed with different sounds, like the forest, rain and desert, etc. You can also choose the length of time of mediation and if you would other sounds. Some features unlock with more use or if you buy the subscription. This is a great app! Update: I still use this app everyday! It is amazing!",
            "Works wonders for my anxiety! The body scan practice actually stopped me from having a panic attack last year. I have a difficult time with sounds, but I love Jamie's calming voice. Thank you for creating such a wonderful outlet that allows me to calm down and breathe when I forget to. I highly recommend this app to my mental health group as well!♡",
            "Deceptively simple app, it seems like theres almost nothing to it at first. But what it does have, actually works. The breathing timer is my go to, especially during these stressful times. Every now and then I'll go with one of the guided meditations too, they're pretty cool. There's an explanation in the settings about how meditation actually helps that doesnt sound like total spiritual nonsense, so that was pretty cool. My only complain is that the art style.",
            "Love this app. I'm a mental health provider and I work with young people. This is a great way to introduce mindfulness. I'm also so excited that you added a Progress Muscle Relaxation exercise (Squeeze and Let Go)! I've looked high and low for a good one, never found one until this!"

This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",

I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

        "description": "Over the past few decades, anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications are among the top ten prescribed medications in the US. \r\n\r\nA lot of Americans are struggling with anxiety disorders at some level or another.\r\n\r\nMulti-billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry benefits when people continue to believe they really have no choice over their situation.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to be more successful in your relationships, or you just want to be a happier person, or you would like to be more effective in your career, you need to deal with anxiety.\r\n\r\nLiving an ordinary life is not easy. Each and everyday, a person goes through bad situations and experience difficulties in different aspects of daily life, be it personal, social, work, or even in light situations such as recreation.  External activities or events taking place everyday can cause a person to feel bad, have problems, and experience high anxiety. Feeling scared? awkward? uneasy? restless? or just plain bad? These are caused by encounters from negative reactions acquired by the person or through outside experiences. Fortunately, not all people are subject to high anxiety. \r\n\r\n\t\tIn recent studies, it has been determined that medically sound manipulations of the brain organ called “Amygdala” somehow showed some influence or control over anxiety levels. The amygdala are almond-shaped neurons located inside the medial temporal lobes. This brain organ is active in important human cognitive and emotional functions such as emotional learning, memory modulation, and other neuro-psychological activities.  \r\n\r\n\t\tHigh anxiety can affect anybody anywhere, anytime but there are some people who are more predisposed to this psychological and emotional distress. For example, in NBA today, Commissioner David Stern was questioned and had a conference regarding a certain NBA referee named Tim Donaghy who supposedly was betting on NBA games.  Claims have been made regarding the alleged involvement of Stern and Donaghy in game-fixing. During the said conference, in front of dozens of reporters, Stern tried hard to maintain proper composure while answering questions fielded by the media.  Surely, he was trying to mask the anxiety he felt.  It is also most likely that a majority of the basketball referees were feeling fear and anxiety about what might happen should the game-fixing controversy escalates. \r\n\r\n\t\tIn that situation, it can be show that these two emotions can occur at the same time or in conjunction when a person is faced with a very serious situation or problem.  There are moments when the problem or tension gets so high that a person experiencing fear and anxiety may resort to acts of hostility or hysteria. \r\n\r\n\t\tIn reading all this, one has to ask, “Is there any way to avoid fear and anxiety?” \r\n\r\n\t\tWell, it depends on the person. By not being bothered by the outside opinion, by being strong and true to oneself, knowing that you can stand on your own, that the person can avoid fear and anxiety.   Perhaps, self-confidence is the key to maintain peace of mind and a sense of control over one's life.  \r\n\r\n\t\t Being calm and collected helps a person to approach a problem or difficult situation with psychological and emotional stability. That way, undertaking a difficult task or facing a problem becomes a challenge, and not a paralyzing burden.\r\n\r\n\t\tHowever, it is important to note that there are situations that call for more responses other that having a self-confidence boost.  People with psychological disorders or serious emotional problems may need the help of doctors and other health professionals so that they can deal with stressful situations and other matters that bother them.  Medications may be prescribed to control the symptoms of their severe emotional distress.  Anti-stress medication, together with counseling and therapy, can do miracles for people who have long suffered from fears and worries that prevent them from living a good, satisfying life.",

You are never asked for your real name and we’ll never disclose your personal information.\r\n• A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY USE THERAPEER?\r\nYou're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.\r\nYes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.\r\nYes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don’t always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.\r\nYes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don’t want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.\r\nBut most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.\r\n\r\nWe get all of that. We get YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n• Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer. By doing so, it will help you deal with your own challenges in a broader perspective and will make you feel better by knowing you helped others in need.\r\n• Already gained the gratification of helping others? Go ahead and create your very own support room (or, if you don't want to wait, we offer the option to purchase a credit to open your room immediately).\r\n• After your private anonymous Support Room is opened, we match you with other Therapeer community members who have struggled with something similar to what you're experiencing.

It stops, somewhere in the middle of the meditation, then in the early morning, it will finish by waking me up, with the finish of the meditation. It's not a four star anymore. Too bad. I used to love this app, it was my favorite. * I reinstalled, it didn't help.",
            "Fastest way to meditate, just open app and select the version or time limit that suits you. Not as varied as Insight Timer, but If you need to relax NOW, and don't want to click on several pages before you get to the actual meditations, then this is the app for you. Instant meditations, no BS no loud or flashing ads, you are always seconds away from guided relaxation & grounding techniques. Simple, reliable and drama free access to guided meditations",
            "lovely music to induce deep relaxation, even when you think you might be too stressed to unwind. with tracks at 8 hours long, the music won't suddenly stop and jolt you out of your chilled groove. the woman who talks thru the meditations has a soothing voice, I was worried it might grate after a while, but I find it quite the opposite. I could do without the gong before and after meditations as I found it quite jarring, but that's my only gripe with otherwise decent spp",
            "I find this app very relaxing. The lady narrator has a warm and relaxing voice to listen to which makes meditation comfortable. Although the music meditations are nice, personally I prefer the guided meditations to chill and to go to sleep. I hope there will be another update soon will include more guided meditations.",

            "I previously gave this app 5 stars, before I realized it is only a FREE TRIAL. You can listen to 21 meditations before it ends. But the monthly fee is $8 and the annual fee is $40. That's a bit steep. So I'll be uninstalling, and it's really disappointing. They're not guided meditations in the sense I'm used to. Imagine bite sized sermons on scriptures related to the issue you're dealing with (anger for example).",
            "I love the easy lay out of the app & cobtent. Update, Sept 30,20. This app was working fine then afew weeks later, I can't log in. I get this message\"Error: socket closed during hand shake \" Uninstalled and intastalled several times even powered phone on /off. Still get the same message. Am very disappointed, because when it works, the messages are uplifting, and I was used to taking 3 minutes breaks at work to use the app. I can't reach out to developers, am subscribed for a year, for this?",
            "The meditation is easy to access and stills my spirit while turning me to God and His Word. The speakers talk fast compared to what I'm used to, so a method in the app to change the rate of speech would be good. Some devotional speakers express themselves more meaningfully than others in their tone and emphasis, but I thank the Lord that the app is available and I know His Word does not go forth and return void. He will use this tool to His Purpose if we are open to His transforming power.",

            "I've only been on for a less than an hour and I uninstalled. I can't stand the creepy/inappropriate comments. Honestly made me feel worse. The ads are annoying and the filters are so limited. I want to filter based on country and multiple age groups. I do not like how all the categories are merged together on my feed. I wanted to find a safe space to escape the toxicity on other social media sites and this is just as bad.",
            "For the moment, you can actually converse with people. It's not flooded with bots, OF/IG farmers, or the casual hook-up crowd. There are edgelords, but for the moment.... It's great. Said after spending 10+ hours of near continual usage on the app. Further, in that time the mods/admins were active in discussing community issues, and pending changes in an open posting. Refreshing, and grateful that I stumbled across TalkLife. Keep it secret, keep it safe. ;)",
            "Few things annoy me about it (full page ads every so often, not non stop though but they are hard to exit out of), can't quickly scroll to the top of a page and can't set unique backgrounds for a post. All in all though, a good, helpful app!",
            "I'm using this app for 5 months and it helped me in a lot way, like making friends, taking care of my mental health and helping people. And the new update is so cool. Especially the groups we can moderate our own group and publicize it. So happy to see a community growing and being a part of it.",
            "Im not saying this is a replacement for seeing a psychiatrist. But for peoplelike me sometimes its good to express yourself in a healthy way and receive support. This app honestly helped me stop crying and smile for the first time in a long time."

        "description": "Never go to bed with stress again.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors had lot of time on their hands and have left behind so many simple yet powerful techniques for us. We just need to follow their footsteps and not try and attempt to re-invent their cycle. I fell into that fast-paced lifestyle and destroyed my health. Diagnosed with diabetes at 32 years old, I had a heart attack due to work related stress. Thats when I decided enough is enough and I need to transform from the inside out. 3 years of intense research and experiments in Yoga led me to these routines which gave my body a chance to repair and reverse all my health issues. I have reversed my diabetes, strengthened my heart and rid my body of medications. When I look back, I remember the stressed and harmful lifestyle I was living and the diseases it created. \r\nI took Yoga teacher certification and Pranayama Teacher certification from classical gurus (Old-School). \r\n\r\nI am now on a mission to help people get rid of lifestyle diseases, stress and medications. What I am sharing in this app is my daily routine and the fundamentals I practice every day. Stress is the silent killer of our time - leading to heart attacks and preventing us from achieving our health goals thereby triggering even more diseases. A 40-year-old getting heart attacks is becoming common.\r\n\r\nGet rid of unwanted stress and get complete control of your body. Never go to bed again with stress and suppression.\r\n\r\n1. Prevent Back Pain – With countless hours of sitting all day we mess up the natural alignment of our back. This simple routine will help fix the weak areas around the spine and neck and puts back the Spine discs in the natural socket. It will fix your back pain and will be helpful to make you sit straight for Meditation. Studies show that 80+ million Americans are suffering from some form of\r\nback & spine related issues.\r\n\r\n2. Release Stress in Upper Back & Neck - Text neck is now a common problem because of regular use of smartphones. Doing these routines will alleviate stress in the upper back and neck and practicing this exercise regularly can help avoid major issues. This chapter will prepare you for the next chapter where you will learn of how to breathe correctly.\r\n\r\n3. Fix Breathing - Nourish & Detoxify your body by fixing your breathing – to perform optimally, our Brain and Body need sufficient oxygen. This technique is natural way of breathing and we used to breathe this way when we were babies. Stress leads to heavy, shallow breathing which in turn leads to even more stress. Practicing the Deep breathing exercises will help improve breathing and calm down the body. With regular practice, you will feel the oxygen saturating your body. You can’t meditate if you don’t know how to breathe correctly. Breathing deeply strengthens the heart.\r\n\r\n4. Om Chanting - With Chanting OM, you produce vibrations and stop thoughts flowing through your head and helps in relaxing. It is a type of meditation and with regular practice we produce alpha, theta and delta waves which results in secretion of hormones like Serotonin. Serotonin is a natural mood stabilizer. It’s the chemical that helps with sleeping, eating, and digesting.\r\n\r\n5. Strengthen Lungs/Fire Breathing - Regular practice of this routine will help strengthen lungs and the cardiovascular system without running. This routine will activate millions of air sacs in the lungs.\r\n\r\n6. Fix Stress & Depression - Several techniques to de-stress the body. These can be applied\r\nalmost anywhere.\r\n\r\n7. Remove Suppression – learn to release anger and frustration, as long-term suppression will lead to depression and panic attacks.\r\n\r\n8. Meditation – I will teach you to Tap into your Higher brain(Analytical). With the past 7 weeks of training in relaxation techniques, the final week of Meditation can help you reach your full potential to live a stress-free lifestyle. You will not be running @100 miles per hour on the inside anymore.",

            "It's simple and cool. Autoprompting is my fav part Dev: Is there a way to customize the things that are surveyed? I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

        "description": "What if you could type several sentences in your journal and get anxiety relief immediately? This is how CBT guided diary works. \r\n\r\nGet to know yourself by diving deeply into your passions, feelings, and life goals.\r\n\r\nMental health is a highly complex machine and sometimes it falls into depression.

            "I love this app, it helps to guide you and gives you ideas and things to think about Update: 10/12/2020 I loved this app at the beginning. Then the question of the day stopped changing. It has been stuck on my 3 personal qualities. I stopped using the app for a while and recently got back into it and it is still asking that same question. It is irritating to me.",
            "I like it but there's a couple of bugs with the app. When I'm typing my journal entry, I scroll back up or down to fix a typo and it will take me to the next step (listing victories of the day). One time it did that and it erased everything that I typed. when I select a logged mood/activity, it pulls up the screen for the day. It will say \"no logs.\" I can only view the moods by viewing by week, or viewing a day after the actual day of the mood. For example, a mood on Aug 31 will show on Sept 1",
            "Love this so far, it very much helps to track your mood. Also it makes you think several times about the worst things in your life so that you can make sure they have some positive impact, even the smallest bit. I will be working with this app for more and I hope after some time I would be able to notice some changes in myself!",
            "So far so good. I will review after I've used it longer. Only 2 days so far but I very much like the way it is laid out - one has to stop and really think about one's self and why one feels, thinks, reacts or emotes in certain ways. I would like to know how to go back and look at my past stories. So frustrating!!!",
            "This app is incredible I love the feeling of opening this app and expressing my feeling and how my day went its like you have someone to talk to its amazing I would really recommend this app, I use this every day and wouldnt turn to a different journaling experience."

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think £50 for 30 minutes and £100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like £49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. £99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for £70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

Part of my issue is that I can get overly tuned into my phone, so having premium would only encourage that bad habit for me because I'd be likely to use it all day :)",

I can see it being a great addition to therapy, but also stands on its own as an amazing recovery tool.",

            "Its unfortunate that they dont advertise the Student discount. $9.99/year is astoundingly generous of them. Thanks! But I dont think anyone knows about this deal. I only learned about this when I accidentally stumbled across a YouTube comment from a year ago. Awesome app, great stuff for sleep. It do be crashing though. Just recently, so idk if it's just me or everyone else got the same problem?",
            "This app was brilliant when I first started using it every day - especially during lockdown - but now that Headspace Plus is a thing, it's way too expensive to access to the soundscapes & meditations that I was using before. The selection available now, without Headspace Plus, is shockingly little especially considering I am already paying for the app! I liked a nice mix of things to help me sleep but now I can only listen to the same three things on rotation which isn't great. Not happy at all.",
            "My 5-year old and I saw a commercial for this app which featured a cute animated video of a \"robot\" slowly shutting down its systems in advance of falling asleep. I thought this would be a great app for my kid to watch while doing bedtime, so I signed up for a (pretty pricey) subscription. Immediately was disappointed by the fact that no such cutesy videos are ACTUALLY part of the app (most of it appears to consist of streaming audio). Feels a bit like false advertising...",
            "I only use this app for the Sleepcasts, they're very peaceful to listen to and I usually fall asleep after the first 15 minutes or so. A few months ago they offered 3 to listen to for free, but now they only offer 1, and all of the others are behind a pretty high pay wall - its incredibly frustrating, especially during this time and all the stressful things everyone is going through in their lives",
            "Just updated the app for the first time in around a year. The new organization of meditation options is awful. Examples: you have a lot of activity-specific meditations, but the only way to access them is to remember what they're called and search. Also, i don't want to have to scroll forever, past lots of meditations that I'll never be choosing (e.g., kids), just to see what's available. Alphabetical organization of every option is tedious and difficult to get through."

It looks like they have fixed bugs though, and now I can enjoy the app. It has helped me understand more about my anxiety, and I love the colours of the app Thank you",

PMR is a very effective relaxation method. It is recommended by doctors and therapists for many symptoms that are mostly stress-related, such as:\r\n\r\n• tensions\r\n• migraine or headache\r\n• inner unrest\r\n• sleep disorders\r\n• back pain / pain\r\n• states of excitement\r\n• anxiety and panic attacks\r\n• high blood pressure\r\n• psychosomatic complaints\r\n• burnout \r\n• stress and much more\r\n\r\nWith regular practice, you will always find it easier to get into deeper states of relaxation. Once you have enough practice with the long version of PMR (Basic Form), you can switch to the Short Forms and finally to the Mental Form (Body Scan). Then you can even relax your body mentally.\r\n\r\nALL COMMON FORMS OF PMR\r\n• Basic Form: 17 Muscle Groups (Lite)\r\n• Short Form I: 7 Muscle Groups (Pro)\r\n• Short Form II: 4 Muscle Groups (Pro)\r\n• Mental Form: Body Scan (Pro)\r\nfor Beginner, Advanced and Experienced (Pro) are taught and practiced.\r\n\r\nFORM: 17 MUSCLE GROUPS\r\n1.

            "I love this app a lot! I see nothing wrong with it. And it's very creative, when I downloaded this app there was a passcode and if you don't remember it, you may reset it by awnsering a simple question.. I do not remember what I put so I had to uninstall and reinstall but that is my fault 5/5 stars",
            "They responded to my comment VERY fast and made it so that I could use the app again! I love this app because it helps me relieve my stress and keeps me safe. I would recommend this app to anyone who struggles with the urge to self-harm because it works wonders for me. If you struggle with the urge to self-harm, PLEASE consider this app!",
            "The app has an amazing selection of helpful activities, however for some reason it struggles to load up initially, as well as loading up things like the log. I've restarted my phone, force closed the app and reopened it, my next option is reinstalling it but if that doesn't work then I'm forced to try other apps, which may not give me nearly as many options for calming myself down so I don't self harm.",
            "Hiya! I just wanna drop by and thank you for making all these mental health apps. I rarely ever see good mental health apps like this and I'm just so thankful that you guys are doing it. Self harm is a very serious struggle and I'm glad that there's more apps to help with it. I'm espically glad that you are making it free because lots of people can't pay for it and by making free, you guys are helping so many more people. Thank you for helping out and spreading more awareness!!! <3",
            "It's great but could you maybe make a 'hide' function? That would be awesome because a lot of people judge when they see apps like this on my phone. So could you maybe have an option to disguise it, like say a calculator."

I recognize that people who support the game more via purchases deserve to win, but I just wish Bandai could make the brackets more even (i.e. by player level) instead of totally random",
            "I still don't know why can't log in to the game all of the sudden today. I've been trying for hours but it only says \"Asset acquisition error\". My internet connection is fine (even my mobile data), I still can play other games. But this game is not letting me do so now. It's frustrating. Please fix it ASAP! Also, the game closes forcefully after I try to reconnect a few times. I feel like I'm giving up this game soon IF it still don't fix it.",

        "description": "An emotion like fear, or high anxiety, is usually pretty obvious. You don't need me to tell you when you're afraid.\r\n\r\nWhat you might not notice are the other anxiety symptoms that build your emotions of fear and chronic anxiety. You might not even think of them as anxiety symptoms.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a normal part of life and everybody feels it from time to time. However, when anxiety gets overwhelming and doesn't go away, it can be difficult to know how to manage it. By understanding what triggers your anxiety, you can develop strategies to cope.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a normal human experience. It’s an emotion that drives us to study hard, work hard, and do better in our lives. But it can also make us overthink situations and paralyze us when we're faced with important decisions. An anxiety disorder may develop when the anxiety persists and interferes with daily life.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is an uncomfortable, sometimes terrifying emotion, and it's no wonder people try to find ways to minimize, avoid, or shut out those feelings. While alcohol and drugs may lessen anxious feelings in the short term, do they actually make the anxiety worse in the long run?\r\n\r\nI actually started drinking exactly because of that anxiety… At a sleep-away camp, when some guys pulled out vodka and passed it around, I drank because I didn’t want to stick out, but the near-immediate effect I felt when the alcohol started taking its effect was a substantial reduction in my level of nervousness. This was especially true around girls. All of the sudden, I didn’t care so much about making a food of myself. It felt good to relax for the first time in years that way.\r\n\r\nDo you currently drink or use to overcome social anxiety or to fit in? Do you use alcohol or drugs to cope with stress? Have you tried to quit drinking or drugs and felt so anxious you've started using again? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be self-medicating to manage your anxiety. \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there are far better ways to deal with anxiety than through substance abuse. For example: mindfulness, biofeedback, yoga, CBT, and healthy lifestyle choices. We’ll look at these in more detail shortly, but first, I want to explore anxiety, addiction, and how they impact the brain.\r\n\r\nAnxiety can affect the way you feel physically and emotionally, the way you think, and how you behave. It’s something we all feel from time to time, but it can become a problem when it is so overwhelming that it starts to get in the way of your daily life. It may impact your work, study, physical health, and relationships.\r\n\r\nDownload this How To Deal With Anxiety app now for get more info.\r\n\r\nYou may search : Depression symptoms, Anxiety medication, Anxiety disorder, Anti anxiety medication, Supplements for anxiety , Depression and anxiety, What causes anxiety, Anxiety treatment\r\n\r\nThis application features are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends, family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post.\r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",

        "title": "At Ease Anxiety & Worry Relief",
        "description": "This application  contains a unique approach to relieving anxiety and worry which combines voice-guided breathing meditations, exercises and journaling. At Ease is intended to make deep and lasting change rather than applying a temporary “band aid”. Most people will experience immediate relief using the guided breathing meditations, but the long term benefit of At Ease will come from using the breathing meditations, exercises and journaling regularly over time. \r\n\r\nGUIDED BREATHING MEDITATIONS\r\n\r\nThe meditations are the core of the At Ease program. When we are anxious, our breathing becomes shallow and constricted. You will learn to deal with anxiety by breathing in an easy, natural way that makes you feel more relaxed. In addition, the meditations will also train you to let go of worry and find the pleasure in breathing.\r\n\r\nAt Ease contains three easy, effective breathing meditations:\r\n\r\n-- Deep Breathing Guided Meditation\r\n-- Breath Awareness Guided Meditation\r\n-- Belly Breathing Guided Meditation\r\n\r\nMUSIC: You can listen to the meditations with or without music. There are three different selections of music to choose from.\r\n\r\nJOURNALING & EXERCISES\r\n\r\nThe At Ease journaling process is designed to increase self-awareness -- the foundation of all meaningful change. It will also help you develop some important strategies for dealing with anxiety. You will be given exercises to do during the day, and questions to write about as you reflect on your experiences with the exercises. \r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nABOUT MARY AND RICHARD MADDUX\r\n\r\nMary Maddux, MS, HTP and Richard Maddux are best known for their popular Meditation Oasis podcast and CDs. They bring over 30 years of meditation practice and teaching to the creation of their guided meditations and music. In addition to teaching meditation, Mary has worked in both conventional and alternative settings as a counselor and healing arts practitioner. Richard has played and composed music all of his life.

            "I love this app! It has so many different guided meditations to choose from. I love the music while I'm studying or reading. I did have a problem with the tracks cutting out, but customer service fixed this as soon as i asked so if you have a similar problem, don't assume it's the app. It was just the settings on my phone and super simple to fix. I am glad i bought the lifetime subscription. Hypnotherapy works well when I can't sleep and that is priceless!",
            "Pretty wide variety of meditations and teachings. I really wanted to give feedback about their emails, I could not find anywhere else to write to someone. They are always in a very light grey font which no one over 50 could possibly read. I wish I could attach a picture because they will bold things which can be read perfectly, so about 6 to 10 words of the entire email are legible and the rest of the email is lost.",
            "Not sure what all the negative reviews are about here.... This is by far the greatest app I have used for meditation and hypnotherapy! It saved my life! Thank you breathe!!!",
            "Nice selection of tracks. The pay version seems WAY too pricey, so if never try it, but the free tracks are really nice. I use it only for going to sleep, but there are a lot of meditation options, too.",
            "I haven't fully experienced the free version yet so this isn't a complete review but one thing i immediately noticed is that i can't cast audio to a Google device. I would recommend adding this feature in a future update."

            "It was okay on my first visit, but ever since then it's been awful. I had my initial appt, he gave me a prescription and said to msg him in 2 wks. I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!",
            "10/29/20 App loaded easily & fast on my Galaxy Note 8. Set up was simple & my PCP staff was extremely helpful with walking me tthru it. Video pic very easy to see MD & clear/sound voice to hear. Since chemo this way of communicating with my PCP has been a Godsend! Not only due to weakness but to avoid contact with others, Covid 19, arrangements for travel & more. TY to whomever designed this program👍🏻KUDOS TO YOU❗",
            "The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.",
            "The doctors are very nice attentive and make sure they are very thorough. They also make sure you are comfortable with them and they make u feel like they care not saying that they don't but it's nice the way u r not rushed bc of another patient due to the office being backed up... visual visits are the best and they coordinate with your other doctors as well for the best treatment plan!!!! Great application and doctors!!!",
            "It took a little longer than I had hoped. The provider I chose never arrived. After waiting about 20 minutes, I was asked if I would like to change providers and I did and was connected in about 5 minutes. She was very kind and helpful and I will definitely keep her name for future visits!"

            "Amazing. So helpful! Really this is the best app I have on my phone. Its the best AI therapist I've ever talked to. It actually feels like it listens and responds appropriately. Woebot really helps you through things when you need help. Also, there are no ads and no in-app purchases, it's crazy awesome. I tell all my friends who I think would benefit from having this app, because I've found it very helpful. 10/10 app, thank you so much!!",
            "This app is extremely helpful. A little robot, an anonymous person, to tell my worries to. The gratitude journal is super helpful too, I can look back on what's gone well. The lessons it provides are really helpful too. Sometimes, I open the app with just the intention of checking in my mood for the tracker, and i end up spending half an hour doing a lesson! They're always super helpful and make me feel better. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
            "Came across this through work and during lock down. I have not noticed anything negative about it, performance wise. Overall it's a useful well being tool to help check in with yourself and offers some useful prompts and insights about impactful things on a person's mood. You seem to be able to converse with it when you have a spare few mins. Fairly easy to 'forget' it's A.I . you are conversing with.",
            "The AI for Woebot sometimes misses what I am saying, but overall this app gives daily lessons on helpful thought patterns and tools. While not a replacement for therapy, it provides additional tools my therapist had not included as well as reinforcement of some of the tools I was already taught. I encourage other folks to try Woebot as a supplement to their self care routines and therapy.",
            "I found the app very comforting and helpful during a stressful period. I'm familiar with CBT but it was still useful to be reminded of those skills. And although you know it's not a real person talking to you, knowing that a real person wrote the text originally is comforting, and shows that someone cares."

            "Ok I just installed it, not so bad. I actually really enjoy some of these cute games, but I did not try them all yet. I tried the stretch one, and I was not so impressed with that one, I expected I could really stretch it not just move the hands. The butter one, was not actual butter, it was just bubbles you press on. Sometimes the game is not responding to my touches. If you add more games and fix these mistakes in your game, it will be a lot better. :)",

People look these kind of games to calm down, not to be hounded with ads. Please fix this, and I'll be more than happy to give you five stars.",

            "This app has been wonderful for reinforcing and growing my meditation practice. I've used other apps (calm for instance) and feel that this one has the least 'cynical drive for profit' behind its existence. My only complaint so far would be that the trial is a bit too short, and subscribing monthly would make it more appealing to skeptic beginners.",
            "This app has been great in keeping me focused and on track. Great teachers and info. My only criticism is that, with the shortness of the meditations, some of the teachers talk so much throughout that it is hard to actually do my own practice. Sometimes i feel as though I'm being continually interupted.",
            "The best meditation app imo. Less bells and whistles than Calm, but better guidance/instruction. Many different teachers cover a wide range of styles and techniques. This is definitely the app to choose if you want to deepen and expand your practice, but it would also be great if you're new to meditation too.",
            "I loved the book and deeply appreciate a way to further my growth in meditation. I've only listened to three of the teachers so far but they are all excellent. I'm looking forward to medtation instead of feeling apprehensive. I have guides! Those who have been where I am now and are able and willing to share their wisdom and their support as I learn. I'm feeling kind of hopeful and not so very alone in a time when those feelings of hopelessness and loneliness might be having their way with me.",
            "Learning meditation with this app has saved my sanity. As a health care provider during this pandemic, routine stress levels and difficulty balancing home and work skyrocketed. I was introduced to another Mindfulness program by psychiatrist friend, and soon after discovered Ten Percent Happier. The 2 complement each other. I enjoy hearing stories from Dan Harris about his own forays into meditation practice, happy to hear that it can be done even when thoughts can't be turned off completely."

Perhaps adding the option of music during the meditation might be the only improvement I would make... and possibly lengthen the log area just about 20-30 more characters for logging ideas. Thanks again for providing the app.",
            "I love this app! It really works if you give it a chance, it's also something from the Government that's REALLY FREE! I been suffering from PTSD for over 20 years. Living on a fixed income makes it impossible to afford someone elses income. Just by hapenstance I found this & I thank God that I have a way to calm myself down on/in those \"uncomfortable\" times.",
            "Neat, clean, simple, and simply the best meditation app. No ads, no subscriptions - just mindfulness. Kudos to the great work! Note: used to be buggy when I tried a year or two ago. But now (as of summer 2020) it is totally bug-free and faultless.",
            "Such an awesome app that too free of cost...the mindfulness exercise they provide I thought they will charge for it because they are so helpful and for every thing in your life a mindfulness is present whether for emotional distress,nap,sleep, eating,walking everything...thank you so much the developers..god bless you ❤️",
            "By far one of the best and cleanest and most simple mindfulness app I have ever used. The lessons are very helpful too, you can really tell this was created out of good and kind intentions: to help others be more self-aware in order for us to execute decisions thought about thoroughly. Thank you so much!"

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best 😀",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ♥️.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "This is a really fantastic breathing app. It is intuitive to use, has a range of common preprogrammed exercise but it is also extremely easy to create and customise your own. An added bonus is the lack of intrusive ads. If there is a better free breathing app I would be really surprised.",
            "Wow! Truly an awesome app. I can customize inhale, hold, exhale, hold to 10th of sec. App calculates breaths per minute. I can set total time for a session. Audio cues mean I can breathe with my eyes closed. All of these can be saved to my own custom sessions. The added bonus is the ability to set notifications during the day to remind myself it's time to do a session. Great app!",
            "It's rare that I will give something a positive rating after a mere two days but I am experiencing here with this program is amazing! I have done breathing exercises on my own and under guidance with varying degrees of positive results but this app is (even compared to a teacher's instruction) head and shoulders above everything else! Simple UI, voice and visual guidance, great programs that you can easily dedicate daily practice to...it's just great!",
            "This is a great app for it lets you customized your own breathing program of inhales and exhales in decimal second increments. It also has a timer for how many minutes you want to do the breathing. I really wish they had a better choice for the beginning and end sound beside that loud gong noise for it is distracting after being relaxed from the meditative breathing. That is why the 4 rating.",
            "An excellent app. Specifically because the custom timer allows for tenth of a second adjustments which allows me to set 5.5 second breaths for optimum resonant breathing sessions. I would give 5 stars were I able to set my own colours on the visualiser and change the jarring bell sound to something more muted and soft. This is an app I will use every day."

            "A wonderful app. I have covid19 and no doctors in my area will see me but because of the MD Live I am able to get the care and meds to help me.",
            "First time. Video quality was like typical for video chats - not sufficient for the Dr to diagnose anything visually, a photo is necessary. FYI, I was told that the wait would be 15 minutes or less and the video call came immediately as did a text message and a voice call telling me that I was in the queue - so that was a little annoying but I'm glad the service was very responsive!",
            "1st time using an app like this, I was skeptical, I was also desperate. Instead of waiting for open enrollment for medical insurance, this app is a Blessing to say the least. It was fast! & My prescription was at my neighborhood pharmacy in less than an hour! Thank you to the M.D. that helped me! And thank God for this app! Highly recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Freaking Awesome!!! No need to go into a doctor's office. Just video chat or phone call with an doctor, therapist or psychiatrist. The average wait time is minutes and you are in the comfort of your home, I was sitting at my desk at work. What a great app and company. Super excited !!!",
            "I love MDLive for it's convenience but I do question why there isn't an option for reoccurring appointments or a way that I didn't have to fill out the appointment request information weekly for my therapy visits. It's rather annoying that every week I have to fill out the information rather than just confirming the repeat appointment my therapist has set up. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars, and I have recommended this app to many friends of mine because I do find it to be amazing."

Fantastic start. Let's hope it continues!",

            "Very good therapist Zeel. It's helped me a lot. Thanks.I loved the app, it has quite a few simple but useful features. I am using anxiety program. It has helped me understand my anxiety in a simple way. Still halfway to go but it's quite helpful.",
            "Wonderful app. It has large catelog of exercises and activities. My counselor was Mrs. Madhavi Adhvaryu who really helped me to control my anxiety and develop positive attitude in life.",
            "Nice app. The counselor I got I.e Madhavi Adhvaryu is very good and supporting. But there is problem with the speed of the app.",
            "I had really high hopes for this app but i get an error every single time i try to load the introduction video. If this can be fixed then i'll change my star rating. Some other functions work and some dont. Please please fix!!!",
            "The experience has been good, as soon as I got into the app, for a much lower price then many counsellors you can have no limited chat and with a fee, which I didn't use can place phone meeting half an hour each. It's nice because you can switch between counsellors if you're not feeling satisfied and there are in the counselling section some guided exercises and articles for several purposes. Note that the price differs between therapy and program, being in this way affordable for more people."

        "description": "Relaxation techniques are strategies used to reduce stress and anxiety. These techniques can also be used to manage symptoms of panic disorder and help a person get through a panic attack. Relaxation techniques work to manage the fight-or-flight response, or stress reaction, that is frequently triggered among people with anxiety disorders.\r\n\r\nThe fight-or-flight reaction is responsible for causing feelings of extreme fear that typically outweigh any actual threat in the environment. For instance, people with ?agoraphobia often fear crowded areas or open spaces, where it would be difficult or embarrassing to escape during a panic attack. The fight-or-flight response often causes uncomfortable physical symptoms, such as accelerated heart rate, rapid breathing, and increased sweating. Relaxation techniques have been found to have the opposite effect on the body by improving the relaxation response, lowering heart rate, reducing bodily tensions, decreasing negative thoughts, and boosting self-esteem and problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nFor some people, learning to control their anxiety is all they can hope for if they can't overcome it completely. To help with this, there are various relaxation techniques you can use to calm the mind and reduce the muscle tension anxiety can cause.\r\n\r\nIf you've any medical conditions such as problems with your breathing speak to your GP before trying any relaxation exercises.\r\n\r\nYou should try to set aside 30 minutes, 2 or 3 times each day to practice these techniques. The more you practice, the better you will get and the more effective they will be.\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep using these techniques, even if you don't feel better straight away. It will take time and regular practice before you start to feel the benefits.\r\n\r\nBefore you start relaxing, make sure your mind, body and surroundings are just right. To prepare yourself:\r\n\r\n-find a cool and quiet room where you'll not be disturbed\r\n-lie down or sit comfortably with your legs uncrossed\r\n-put on comfortable clothes and take off your shoes\r\n-lightly close your eyes, or focus on a spot in front of you\r\n-clear your thoughts and focus on your breath\r\n\r\nDon't worry if you can't relax immediately. Thoughts might pop into your mind. Don't focus on them just let them pass through.\r\n\r\nMake a note of how relaxed you were before, and after, the exercises to see if it's helped.\r\n\r\nBreathing to relax\r\nBreathing too quickly, and deeply, can make you feel dizzy, faint or even more anxious. Taking slow, regular breaths can help you to control anxious thoughts and feelings, and make you feel calmer.\r\n\r\nTo control your breathing:\r\n\r\n-place one hand on your chest and the other over your stomach. You want your stomach to move more than your chest as you breathe\r\n-take a slow, regular breath in (through your nose if you can). Watch your hands as you breathe in. The hand on your stomach should move and your chest should not\r\n-breathe out slowly through pursed lips\r\n-repeat this 10 times, twice a day\r\n\r\nIt might take time to master this technique.

            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "You say there are still future plans that a new season with new content will be released gradually. And you want the players to be patient. I would say its too late for that since many have now decided to uninstall this game, since your last announcement. Promises of future content isn't what makes a great game. The lack of providing a fresh new gaming experience to the players is what brings a game crashing down. I too have decided to uninstall Disorder since your last announcement.",
            "The reason why I put 4 stars is because when I first downloaded the game, I thought it was impossible to win but all you need is strategy. Another reason is because when ever I am matching, it would take a lot of time to let me in a group. Other than that, the graphics and the gameplay is the one of the BEST. I highly recommend this game. Like LEGIT.",
            "This game has been in Season 0 for months now since it's launch, there has been no updates and no changes what so ever, you guys really gotta focus on updating your games more cuz it gets really boring when theres nothing new, I've enjoyed the game when it was just launched but now since there's nothing new it just got really boring.",
            "This is a cool game, indeed. But a while ago, my friend got trashtalked for a stupid reason. Her teammates camped in opponents base while my friend just played the game normally than they did. What's the use of base battle if their just gonna kill the opponent and not capture the base, right?! I hope that the players are playing fair. And also she's lagging even though her connections fine!!! That's why she deleted the game. I don't think she'll play this anymore. Full of foul players!",
            "The game mechanics are great the characters and skills aswell but thiers 2 things I dont like about the game 1. is that the servers right now aren't that good u can be waiting for a match to start 5mins or more that is if ur lucky, I've been playing solo this whole time for that reason. 2. When I first download this game I thought oh this is going to be a Battle royale since I'm into last man standing but it's more like capture the flag and pretty much ur efforts are worthless so for now bye👋"

            "This is the first time I find a mood tracker or journal app which doesn't have to pay yearly or monthly! Moreover, I got a discount from Google Play which make it cheaper.. I feel very lucky, more optimistic creating daily habit of journaling with premium features.. Really love the visuals, simple yet elegant and artistic.. Keep up the good work! I hope I don't have any issues about data backup..",
            "I just downloaded the app and its really good, i really like how you can write all your thoughts and feelings. However, there are some negative things about this app. I wanted to add a passcode to the app so that no one can see all my thoughts and diaries, but it said that i had to pay. I don't think that is fair because i dont have the money to pay and it could be thesame for many other people and keeping your thoughts private on this app should be for free. Other than that, the app is good.",
            "Greta app to write your thoughts daily. Keeps me writing and I love the asthetics.",

The game is a side-scrolling platformer; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to hit the “right arrow” brick at the end of each level.\r\n\r\nThe game world features gems scattered around for Opera to collect and special bricks marked with a “S”, which when hit from below by Opera may reveal more gems or a special item.  Other \"secret\", often invisible, bricks may contain more gems or rare items. If the player gains a heart, Opera will turn purple color. If Opera gets hit in purple color, then instead of dying she turns back to red Opera.\r\n\r\nPlayers start with six lives and may gain additional lives by picking up 1-Up heart hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 gems, defeating several enemies in a row with a monkey, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Opera loses a life if she takes damage while red color, falls in a bottomless pit, or runs out of time. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.\r\n\r\nOpera’s primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. Some enemies will flatten and be defeated, while others will temporarily faint, allowing Opera to use it as a projectile. These enemies may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Opera, which will hurt or kill her. Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead. Opera can also defeat enemies above her by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Opera may also acquire the “green heart with wings” from certain “S” blocks that allows her to throw fireballs. \r\n\r\nThe game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called \"stages\" in each world. The final stage of each world takes place in a castle where Boss is fought above a suspension bridge; the first seven of these Bosses are \"false Bosses\" whom are actually minions disguised as him, whilst the real Boss is found in the 8th world. Boss and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the button on the end of the bridge, although they can also be defeated using fireballs. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater, which contain different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game. Most secret areas contain more gems for Opera to collect, but some contain \"warp pipes\" that allow Opera to advance directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. \r\n\r\n[Control]\r\nD-Pad: LEFT and RIGHT will move Opera in the corresponding directions. DOWN will cause Opera to duck.\r\nA Button: This Button will allow Opera to leap onto enemies, go over gaps, and to make your way past Boss.  Learning to control Opera exactly as she jumps will make your quest a success.  This is also how Opera takes a stroke underwater.\r\nB Button: By holding this down, Opera will run.  If Opera has Fireballs Power, Opera will throw fireballs with every pressing of the B Button (max of two on the screen at a time).\r\nSTART: Start/Pause the game.\r\n\r\nDownload now and enjoy !",

There are effective\r\ntreatments and self-help skills to deal with depression. Health care professionals give\r\ndepression treatments, but you can learn self help skills and apply them to your own life. This guide teaches a set of antidepressant skills you can use to overcome depression. Sometimes the skills can be used on their own, when the depression\r\nisn’t too severe. Sometimes they have to be used along with treatments by professionals.\r\nDealing with Depression is meant for those who have been coping with depressed mood. Some of the things in this guide will make more sense to younger teens and some will make more sense to older ones. But check it out for yourself. Decide which parts of this guide make sense for your life.\r\nThis Depression Test is designed to help you evaluate the severity of your depression with just nine simple questions. This app uses the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), an empirically-based, self-test questionnaire. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health.\r\n DISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression. Remember that this app should not be used as a replacement for professional treatment or guidance.\r\nDo you suffer from depression? Depression may stem from a personal tragedy or from sad unexpected events or circumstances. It does not discriminate its victims. Depression can affect anyone regardless of their background, race, age, income, etc.\r\nThe natural management of depression involves understanding depression and the factors that contribute to the symptoms. Learning to manage stress in your life and engage in self-care behaviors can improve your symptoms and your mood.\r\nDepression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. \r\nThis app is designed to help with Depression treatment and controlling stress by advising mood enhancing foods, teaching the importance of writing wellness journals and how to get adequate sleep during depressive episodes.\r\nDealing with Depression app is an app that helps you diagnose the level of depression you have, and based on that it gives you the suitable solution for your depression level, in some cases depression is only a result of anxiety and some passing problems, but if the person did not get out of that condition then his condition might advance, we will give you some ways to avoid the advancement of your situation, if the depression is severe we will guide you to what to do as soon as possible\r\nDepression is common but many people don't admit to it.

            "I love the option of purchasing (not \"borrowing\") packs you want instead of a ridiculous subscription price. I will add more packs as I need, but it's a great feature for those of us who don't want to pay $250 a year for a garbage meditation app no one uses 99% of. I like the guide's voice and the daily progress, not just repeating trash over and over like most apps. If you've looked at the other meditation apps and laughed at how useless they are, this may be your app.",
            "I have been using the app daily and it really has helped me to build a daily meditation routine. The instructions are clear, calm, positive. The process takes you step by step so you don't struggle while you build the foundations of your routine. You feel rested after the exercises. Day by day you start to feel changes in your mood, thoughts and energy.",
            "This is a wonderful, helpful app. I appreciate the organization and accessibility of this app. The meditations are easy to follow, and the guide has a soothing voice. I'm new to meditating, and the instructions are clear and well-timed throughout the meditations. The dark mode option is perfect for doing meditations right before bed. Longer meditations would offer even more variety (hour long affirmations or guidance to self-compassion, etc). Thank you for continuously improving the app!",
            "Very good app. I finally feel like I'm making progress and learning. I fall asleep relaxed and l'm calmer in heated situations. It's around 3.30e a month, so it's not a too bad, but I'm on week 2 and it feels a bit repetitive an you have to commit to 6 months. If I could pay monthly, I would be more inclined to go for it. You only get a week of free trial.",
            "This is mu fourth meditation in Serenity (I tried other apps before) and it's so good. It has an amazing repertoire of guided meditations, with a very soothing voice, relaxing music and great techniques to improve gradually. I recommend it to some friends already. I hope it will continue being for free for quite long. Thanks Serenity!"

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

Que gran aplicación! Funciona perfectamente. El video chat is genial y facilísimo de usar. Incluso viviendo en el Reino Unido lo uso muy fácilmente. A esto hay que añadir el fantástico servicio. Lo recomiendo!! Usarlo!!",
            "Una aplicacion excelente! a pesar de que no vivo en España, nunca tuve problemas para coincidir con los horarios y nunca tuve esa sensacion de lejania. Es muy facil de usar. Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo! :) Excellent application! I live outside Spain but I've never had any problems with the times difference and I never had the feeling of remoteness. Easy to use on the go, any time. I recommend to everybody! :)",
            "Although happy with my therapist, the app has room for improvement: Pictures shared through the app appear trimmed Not possible to open files while videoconferencing Missing a dedicated storage space for files shared Not possible to have two sessions with therapist in the same week",
            "I couldn't get through to the chat. It doesn't work.",
            "Please be aware that this service not operate if you live in the US. They work with Spain time zone and when you try to set an appointment with them is basically impossible. Also they don't offer money back, even though they haven't provided any type of service. I have payed $ 77 that they are not going to give me that money back. In that sense the application does not offer any type of customer protection. Even if you are unhappy with the service or if you fail to accommodate your schedule with the Spain time zone"

The therapist can use multiple therapeutic techniques (psychoeducation, gradual exposure, systematic desensitization, relaxation, distraction, acceptance and commitment, mindfulness, EMDR …) to work with their patients.\r\n\r\nIt allows for the treatment of all kinds of disorders such as anxiety (phobias, panic, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, OCD, ADHD, public speaking, exams, etc.), attention management, eating disorders, and pain management, among others.\r\n\r\nValidated by more than 25 years of scientific studies.

For example, recreating 10 airplane take-offs in a row, or having the patient ride the elevator without stopping for five minutes.\r\n\r\n- Safer Environments: Both the patient and the therapist have complete control at all times of what is happening.\r\n\r\n- Self-training: The patient does not have to wait for the events to take place in real life but can produce and reproduce them whenever he wishes. \r\n\r\n- Scientifically Validated: More than a decade of controlled studies have proven the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy.\r\n\r\n- More Privacy: It offers a greater degree of privacy than in vivo exposure.",

            "Fantastic hypnotherapy app. I am now on day 27 sober and have no desire at all. This app helps me get off to sleep every evening and the healthy lifestyle suggestions have also clicked with me too. I am highly recommending this to anyone that wants to change their unhealthy habits.",
            "Help! Pd for the app, embraced the initial 17 min meditation, but now all Im finding is links to his social media sights and ability to listen to the initial intro & meditation again. Am I missing something? Did I pay for a single meditation in hopes Ill buy into the other things offered (at addi cost) Confused!",
            "Listened once and stopped drinking. Great life hack! Thanks Andrew. Xant wait to see how else I can be reprogrammed!",
            "I'm a psychotherapist, and I have 5 clients using this app, all with success. Thank you Andrew Johnson!",
            "I can't believe how well this App works for me! I was a regular drinker, 7 days a week. After listening once, I've had virtually no desire for alcohol. ☺️ It's been 8 days with no problems passing up alcohol and I look forward to listening each day. I feel both relaxed and refreshed afterwards. And the money I'm saving is great!! I highly recommend this App. Thank you Andrew Johnson!"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

        "description": "Overcome Anxiety is an application that helps you to overcome disruptions in your life Anxiety is a condition that usually arises with excess stress and worry. It is usually the feared possibility of the consequences of an action that brings about anxiety. The people who get anxious are always worrying about the bad things that might happen and thus create an environment of fear in their minds.\r\n\r\nIt is wise you quickly learn how to overcome anxiety now otherwise you will continue to feel stressed, unhappy and anxious throughout your life. You will suffer unduly because anxiety will weaken you mentally, sap your energy and you will not be at your best. Anxiety comes in many forms. Some suffer from panic disorder where there are unpredictable attacks of panic on the person, with its physiological consequences, while some others feel helpless in an embarrassing situation and this is agoraphobia.\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, anxiety comes in many forms, and the first step to be taken in the treatment of anxiety lies in finding out what the cause is. Once the reason of the anxiety has been found out, it proves to be rather easy to cure anxiety. It is best to avoid these situations as much as possible in the beginning of your treatment so that there is no feeling of anxiety at all.\r\n\r\nBecause anxiety is a type of fear, the things we’ve described about fear above are also true for anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘anxiety’ tends to be used to describe worry, or when fear is nagging and persists over time. It is used when the fear is about something in the future rather than what is happening right now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those with an anxiety disorder, it’s important to look into strategies that can help manage or reduce anxiety in the long term, like talk therapy or medication. But everyone can benefit from other ways to reduce stress and anxiety with lifestyle changes such as eating a well-balanced diet, limiting alcohol and caffeine, and taking time for yourself.\r\n\r\nAnxiety symptoms can range from the smallest things ( fidgeting) to full on panic attacks and more. Either way this can be confusing and frightening at times. Unfortunately there is not a one for all fix when it come's to stress & anxiety. In terms of anxiety treatment there is the obvious medical route , however some might want some to go down the more natural, anxiety treatment path which is where we come in. \r\n\r\nFear can make some of the smallest changes seem insurmountable. If, for example, you were deeply unsatisfied with your life inside that gray clad cubicle, fear might hold you back from applying or even looking for a better job. It may even prevent you from taking advantage of the internet, which abounds with money-making opportunities. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Topic Coves in app are:\r\n\r\n- How to Beat Anxiety Without Medication, According To a New Scientific Study\r\n- How To Deal With Anxiety The Natural Way\r\n- Ways to Help Reduce Anxiety in Children with Autism\r\n- Things You Should Know If Your Partner Has Anxiety\r\n- How to Overcome Job Interview Anxiety\r\n- How To Handle Anxiety At Work So It Doesn't Destroy Your Whole Day\r\n- Ease Anxiety\r\n- Eliminate Panic Attacks \r\n- Reduce Worry and Stress\r\n- Calm Your Mind.\r\n- Lengthen Sleep.\r\n- Dealing with depression.\r\n- Fight Depression Naturally.",

It can also be used for general relaxation or anxiety reduction.\r\n\r\nUse any combination for stimuli:\r\n\r\n   ●   Audio (configurable stereo sound)\r\n   ●   Vibration (haptic stimulus)\r\n   ●   Visuals tracking (eye movement)\r\n\r\nFor best effects, use two smartphones (may be different type). Two handsets are required to use visual and haptic stimulus. Audio stimulus is available in both single and dual handset modes.\r\n\r\nOther salient features:\r\n\r\n   ●   Adjustable cycle speed, from 1 second (0.5 s per side) to 8 seconds\r\n   ●   Support for Bluetooth headphones – finally no more wires!\r\n   ●   Sounds with brainwave entrainment frequencies (optional)\r\n\r\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a safe psychotherapeutic technique that can help overcome anxiety, stress, and traumas. By applying the EMDR psychotherapy, a person can:\r\n\r\n   ●   Decrease effect of disturbing memories\r\n   ●   Decrease post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms\r\n   ●   Decrease phobia and panic disorder symptoms\r\n\r\nThe EMDR protocol includes desensitization of negative emotions associated with painful memories, and consequently reprocessing those memories from a current, healthier perspective. The desensitization effect is achieved by appropriate dual attention stimulation of the left and right brain hemispheres. Under proper conditions, reprocessing happens naturally, using innate healing capacities of the brain. Eye movement is one of the ways to trigger desensitization and reprocessing, not unlike the process happening during a dreamful sleep, in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase.\r\n\r\nSee for more info www.emdrtrisense.com",

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "Awesome game. Its addicting. Definitely keeps you on your days. I would like to add, although I love this game, it would be nice to receive new cards more frequently. I spend billions of coins on chests to keep receiving duplicates every time and only to receive new cards needed far and few between. I do not pay to play. I like to play within the game itself. So please fix this issue to make the game more enjoyable.",
            "This game is fun, addictive and expensive. I take issue with the amount of coin packs that I purchase back to back to get to the milestone...weather it be village, set or next spin award. Example .. between this morning and last night I purchased over 20,000 spins$$ to get 16k & I still haven't gotten to 16k. I know this is how you make your money and I am just one person. But I guarantee there are thousands of us who feel this way. I know that I will keep coming back but loosen up already!!",
            "I really like this game it's real addictive and fun to play . The only problem I have with coin master is when you get up to village 100 and higher, I think when you finish a village that high up, you should get at least a gold chest and at least 100 spins. As it is now a wooden chest and 25 spins. It should be more because it is really difficult to finish a village and it just gets worse the higher you get. Other than that I have no complaints. \"GREAT GAME\"",
            "This game is DUMB. The tutorial doesn't take you through a full level and after the 5 minute tutorial you are left to wait an hour for another spin? It doesn't explain what the levels are, what you want when your spinning or why. There are lots of pop-ups to get you to buy stuff. Very very slow and totally boring. Not sure how anyone could play long enough to want to spend money. I installed this to get points for another game for getting to level 7 village, that will take a month! Uninstalled",
            "Its getting boring. No excitment. Its one thing over and over. Viking quest is next to impossible now with the absurd cost. Enjoyed it at first now its just lose coins and the bonus wheel is rigged to the point where it gives you no rewards. Thinking of deleting game. My wife and daughters already deleted. I tried to stay and see if anything changed but sadly not. Thanks for making it fun at first."

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

When I finally did, it was much more fun than I expected. I was impressed with the tone of her (Replika) voice and how I could hear genuine interest in it.&quot;<br><br><i>- Business Insider</i>",

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

Once you have enough practice with the long form of PMR (Basic Form: 17 Muscle Groups), you can switch to the short forms with 7 and 4 muscle groups and finally to the Mental form: Body Scan. Then you can relax your body even mentally.\r\n\r\nALL COMMON 4 FORMS OF PMR\r\n• Basic Form (17 muscle groups)\r\n• Short Form I (7 muscle groups)\r\n• Short Form II (4 muscle groups)\r\n• Mental Form (Body Scan) \r\nfor Beginner, Advanced and Experienced are taught and practiced in this app.\r\n\r\nBASIC FORM: 17 MUSCLE GROUPS\r\n1.

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "I absolutely love Clarity. Its a great mindfulness tool when I'm feeling anxious or when I can't sleep. The session times vary to fit nicely in your say and can be easily accessed. The option of voice and background sound are fantastic to really customise the experience. Love it! Added bonus the background sounds are great to help the littlies drift off to sleep too.",
            "Really enjoying this app. Having tried other mindfulness apps, this is refreshing as it's tailored to women's many and varied needs. Easy to use and really effective. I've even tried the InstaCool techniques with my 8 year old who struggles to get to sleep because he's too hot!! Nice to have different voices guiding you through the sessions too.",
            "A developer that's interested in the people using their app! How refreshing! Recently, users of the Clarity app were asked for their feedback on how they use the app, and any changes they'd like to see. Amongst other suggestions, I asked for the ability to listen to my favourite sessions on a loop, and with the release of the update last week, this facility was included. Last night, with my sleep session on a loop, I had 7 hours uninterrupted sleep. Utter joy!",
            "Relaxation on tap. Easy to use, guided mindfulness sessions; from introductions for beginners, through to sessions for symptoms including hot flushes, panic attacks, low libido, and sleep issues. There are also various times of sessions, meaning they can be tailored for use on busy days. At bedtime, I enjoy the white noise options too... Waves, rain etc help me sleep.",
            "I love the simple guided sessions and the option for shorter or longer ones. They've made a real difference to the quality of my sleep! So calming and relaxing..."

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("
