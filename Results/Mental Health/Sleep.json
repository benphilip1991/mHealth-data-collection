            "Have been using this app for a few weeks now- EXCELLENT sounds for sleep- BUT- as I set the alarm to shut off it wakes me back up. Now the app keeps appearing on my screen in the middle of the day- annoying. So, it was good for a little while but I will keep searching and will have to uninstall to get some sleep. Thanks anyway, you tried.",
            "Have been using it for a while now. It's staggering how much the app has improved within little time. The sound quality and the UI is amazing and most importantly everything works perfectly for free. Truly amazing work by the devs.",
            "I love it really didn't thank would work so many enjoyable things to choose from take your mind to good memories and helps you to really relax so very thankful I found it, still using it , used many of the different things it offers and still not disappointed works for me even on some nights that am having a lot of trouble sleeping from pain or restlessness I turn it on pick out what I want to hear and off to a restful sleep I go I really enjoy it a lot have recommended it to family and friends",
            "I really love this app and I've been using it to sleep and relax recently! I would love for it to have timers for less minutes like 5, 10, 15 as the current shortest is 30 mins and for it to have an alarm for when the time is over so that it can be used for short naps.",
            "Update: took a while, but Finally sleeping more than a few minutes here and there. The 45 minute sleep meditation helps big time. Having Fibromyalgia makes sleep near impossible. Even when taking a sleeping pill, it doesn't help all the time. Despite the fact that I still don't get much sleep, my body is resting more than before using this app. If I can shut down completely and get a solid 60 minutes of sleep, I'll be raising it up to a full 5 stars (posting this at 1AM EDT)."

            "Great app! Tracks sleep, works with a TON of other services, and much more. Things this app does that I have yet to see another app do all in one include: 1. Spotify integration 2. Wearable integration 3. Capachas, which are there to make sure people like me that are deep sleepers are actually up 4. Sounds to help you fall asleep 5. Smart light integration One last thing: The upgrade is also worth the money.",
            "It isn't as reliable as I'd like, it interferes with you listening to other audio as you fall asleep, and in general it doesn't do a great job of analyzing anything strange about your sleep. It doesn't seem to auto detect sleep properly based on other activity, and it doesn't always detect it when you wake up. It's sort of a big app that a lot of people use that just doesn't seem that great in the end.",
            "Update 2020-10-30: reinstalled Sleep as Android and now working. If anyone else having same issue, backup settings then uninstall / install. Worked for me. Update 2020-10-29: latest update breaks the registered version again. Please fix Update 2020-09-16: New update for unlock resolved my issue I was having as trial mode instead of paid premium. Things are back to normal. Thank you for the great support! Btw, best alarm clock program. Update 2020-08-23: unlock for premium stopped working.",
            "Junk app. Shows a portion of your sleep graph but no way to see it all . Try to expand it and all you will accomplish is highlighting the portion you're already seeing. When you try to listen to the sounds that it ostensibly recorded during your sleep, all your hear is various recordings of what sounds like alien gun fire. I have no idea why anybody would give this junk app a high rating. If you want a good app try sleep cycle.",
            "One of the best-written apps EVER! Functionality is amazing! But!.. 1. Weirdly, I couldn't find alarm duration, and I need multiple alarms to wake up, not just one hour-long alarm, brain just ignores it. 2. When the swipe menu is open, the Back button closes the program, not the menu, weird too."

            "I've used this for a few weeks. I made a custom sound that reminds me of sleeping outside on our back lawn growing up... the flow of a large irrigation ditch and crickets. With the timer feature, it is almost perfect. If I could add an occasional frog, that would be perfect. The frog on the app is too repetitive. OCCASIONAL is missing. If the city, not the country is your thing, this app has that, too. Using free version.",
            "This app is very straightforward and easy to get started. The sounds are pleasant/relaxing and are accompaniedwith nice visuals. There are lots of options and it is fun to mix and customize different sounds. The visual design is gorgeous and beautiful with the use of cool nightly colors. (Gradients can be hard to pull off but you guys made everything so beautiful and easy to read bravo!!!) I am excited to use this more in my daily life to help me relax and get away from the rustle and bustle.",
            "In using this app for 5 minutes after installing it \"I was hooked!\" The amount of control you have over what weird variations that make us individuales are all found here. I was able to completely customize what, \"I need to sleep.\", here and be very specific in my wants and needs. I highly recomend it if you're used to falling asleep with the TV on like I do. I usually wake up as soon as the TV shuts off. I like the timer on this app as I somtimes need to have something running while I sleep.",
            "By far the best app for sleeping, you can customize everything to suit what helps you sleep. There are so many options to chose and you can individually turn volume up or down. I downloaded a few apps like this and i didnt even bother checking them out, i just uninstalled all of them and kept this one. Thanks for the great app, the rain is the only sound that helps me sleep and the added customized features help even more. Ive only used it for 2 minutes and i love it!",
            "Wonderful, especially being able to make custom sound mixes. Even my dogs and cats sleep better with the sounds playing! Some sounds in mixes seem to delay going on and sometimes don't go on at all. This may be sue to available bandwidth or something else (?) Like that it plays even while net surfing! Excellent, very useful, healthy app much needed in these stressful times. THANK YOU!"

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "Full of weird notifications and ads, im sure they sell your data... The sleep score is useless, based almsot solely om what you put as how you feel when you woke up. I put i feel great after sleeping five hours with no (detected) REM and it gave me a 9.5! An hour after i said i felt great i crashed lol. Also, it cant detect awake vs. light sleep, at least not on my phone.",
            "I personally LOVE this app!!! I've only used it for 2 nights and decided to buy the full version. Not only does it show when you are in a deep or light sleep, but it records the sounds around you. It picked up my fan, the rain outside, vehicles going down the road and me snoring! I always take my phone with me if I wake up to go to bthrm or get a drink so it picked up on the fact I woke up. Definitely would recommend!",
            "It records your tossing and turning and will show in a colourful bar graph when you were in light and deep sleep, awake and also rem. It then gives you a percentage of how much of your sleep were in each category. It records the time you go to sleep (with an amount of time between switching on the 'start sleeping' and when you actually fall asleep). The basic (no payment option) saves only the last 7 sleeps of information - if you want it to save more you can pay (but I'm just using it free)",
            "I actually like it very much. So much that I bought the full version for a year. But since I got my new smartphone I can't save the audios anymore which was the main part for me to pay for it... The problem is got fixed in less than two weeks, the support is kind, fast and understanding",
            "This app is great. Noise factor is high, because of furnace running. It's by my bedroom. Otherwise it is really quiet here in the evening. It doesn't keep me awake. I use the sounds on my phone to help me fall asleep."

            "Deeper sleep than with any other sounds. We've used a box fan in our room for years to help us sleep. I downloaded this app and used it on a vacation when we didn't have room to pack the huge box fan. Using a combination of white, brown, and other noises, including the Dreams frequency, we slept deeper than we could remember ever having slept before. Now we use this all the time and consistently wake up feeling nicely rested. The paid version is so worth it because of the dream frequency.",
            "I used to use this back when it was just a webpage, and it's helped so much with my anxiety and night terrors. This kind of app is deeply helpful for people like me. I love it, it's incredible, but I'm SO disappointed at the fact that premium is a SUBSCRIPTION and the outrageous price for it. If there was an option to purchase a certain package, like specific sounds, I'd have rated this the 5 stars it should have. I don't need new content every week. Unfortunately, it gets a 3.",
            "Wonderful! I used this a long while ago and decided to come back to it. I've been using the isochronic sounds for a while and they've actually helped! But i hear a LOT of static when i use them. I'm not sure if its an app problem or maybe phones arent meant to run such a low tone but its gotten a bit worse. Other than that the sounds are all perfect and just what i need with the free version.",
            "It's a lifesaver. You don't need cell service or wifi to use it, so no matter where you are you can have a waterfall, a campfire, and some peaceful music (or whatever noises you want) for free. It uses very little battery as well and will play in the background if you're using other apps. There are some noises you have to upgrade for, but for the most part, it's free, loud, and doesn't have audible looping. Thank goodness for this app.",
            "I really like the 'eternity' sound but every time I turn it on, there's this static noise that pops up. Its very distracting. I thought it might be my phone but I turned on the same music on YouTube and Spotify and there was no static, so it's definitely the app. I would like to continue using it on the app because it plays on and on but I don't want the static noise."

The moment I turn it on, my body resets itself. It help me go into a deep slumber which I cant remember when last I had one. I really recommend this app. It is awesome.",
            "This is the very best app. I have found for sleep. I never reach the end of the \"Sleep Stories\" which is the whole point - wonderful! I have only just started using this app. and am very interested in exploring your other options. You seem to offer an Holistic approach for well being. Thank you.",
            "I gave this app 5 starts because it provides all the necessities, sleep stories, sleep music, excersises and more. There is also a sleep stories of the day which allows you to listen to stories that are only for plus so if you can't get plus you can still listen to a variety of stories without paying the price! Highly recommend.",
            "I love it. I found the perfect family home to raise my kids in though it has one major factor I thought I could never get used to... it's right next to the train line where at night quite frequently a loud horn sounds to prevent someone being hit if they are crossing the tracks. Without this app I dont think I could have gotten to sleep at all so it is my life saver and I completely love it. Thank you for being the solution to my worries. Sleep is vital and we all deserve the best.",
            "After we got into our tailored to me sessions, I found I felt a little better and lighter each time. My one little drawback was that I could not get a question answered for me regarding how I will be receiving daily reminders. I had hopes it could be an alarm but I still don't know how I will receive my 6:45 am reminder. Any thoughts there I would appreciate an email with the answer! I think this can be a great tool in a wide array of personal areas. I also appreciate the anonymity."

I have separate personalized sounds for night and day, so I can play it wherever AND whenever I'm sleeping, cause it's right on my phone. And best part is, because I use it consistently for bed, as soon as it starts playing, my brain says.. Ok! Bedtime! And when I shut it off, my brain switches to waking mode! Love, love, love it!",
            "Amazing experience with this app, as there are so many sounds and you can add more to the existing presets or you can make your own custom sound. Then you can set a time and it turns off the sound when the timer is up. There are also many sounds like: rain, rain on the window, the desert, a vintage train and white, brown and pink noise. Then you can add crickets and fire crackling and more. I have had many sleepful nights and I enjoy the app so much thanks.",
            "This app has been great for helping me sleep better. When it's not in use I find myself waking up in the middle of the night and being unable to get back to sleep, but that never seems to be the case when using this app. I don't have a ton of apps on my phone, preferring to use it for the basics, but this is one I use every day. Unfortunately it's started pestering me with ads, even though I have a play pass subscription.",
            "it works. its easy to accidentally turn off though. lots of adjustable settings. The biggest problem is the ads that can appear when u select another sound. Its not fun having a loud ad blasting through the house waking everyone in middle of night.",
            "I have mild Sleep Apnea and I didn't do well with The CPAP. Since I started Sleep Sounds I don't take so long to fall asleep. I'm sure many other people find getting to sleep difficult as we tend to think about daily stresses and negative thoughts. When I listen to my favorite sounds I fall asleep within 5-10 minutes. Love this app. My teenage son and my elderly mother say \"It works!\" I highly recommend it. Sweet Dreams!"

            "Its unfortunate that they dont advertise the Student discount. $9.99/year is astoundingly generous of them. Thanks! But I dont think anyone knows about this deal. I only learned about this when I accidentally stumbled across a YouTube comment from a year ago. Awesome app, great stuff for sleep. It do be crashing though. Just recently, so idk if it's just me or everyone else got the same problem?",
            "This app was brilliant when I first started using it every day - especially during lockdown - but now that Headspace Plus is a thing, it's way too expensive to access to the soundscapes & meditations that I was using before. The selection available now, without Headspace Plus, is shockingly little especially considering I am already paying for the app! I liked a nice mix of things to help me sleep but now I can only listen to the same three things on rotation which isn't great. Not happy at all.",
            "My 5-year old and I saw a commercial for this app which featured a cute animated video of a \"robot\" slowly shutting down its systems in advance of falling asleep. I thought this would be a great app for my kid to watch while doing bedtime, so I signed up for a (pretty pricey) subscription. Immediately was disappointed by the fact that no such cutesy videos are ACTUALLY part of the app (most of it appears to consist of streaming audio). Feels a bit like false advertising...",
            "I only use this app for the Sleepcasts, they're very peaceful to listen to and I usually fall asleep after the first 15 minutes or so. A few months ago they offered 3 to listen to for free, but now they only offer 1, and all of the others are behind a pretty high pay wall - its incredibly frustrating, especially during this time and all the stressful things everyone is going through in their lives",
            "Just updated the app for the first time in around a year. The new organization of meditation options is awful. Examples: you have a lot of activity-specific meditations, but the only way to access them is to remember what they're called and search. Also, i don't want to have to scroll forever, past lots of meditations that I'll never be choosing (e.g., kids), just to see what's available. Alphabetical organization of every option is tedious and difficult to get through."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I often hear the sound skip, like it suddenly stops and starts, repeatedly every night at random intervals. I've also woken up in the night to realize it stopped working altogether. I've tried restarting the app, closing all apps and reopening it, and restarting my phone, but it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and I don't think I can justify the purchase until it's fixed.",
            "To put it bluntly: this app rocks! Honestly! I've tried multiple apps such as this, but none of them had a feature where you could add music to ambient noises, not music of the type this app has. Due to personal reasons, I suffer from relentless insomnia, but this was literally my \"Ultimate Sleep solution\"! Every megabyte sacrificed for this app was worth it!",
            "I love this app. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have recently started having problems wit the app. It stops about 2 hours after I start it. I have purchased the premium package when I first got it, and it played all night. Now it doesn't. I love hearing music all night, it helps me sleep, so when it stops I wake up.",
            "Love this app and it's been a huge aid to sleep. I used to toss and turn for an hour or more, but now I almost always fall asleep well before the 45min timer turns off my favoured sound. There's a great variety of sounds too, lots more than other apps I've tried and much more realistic. I only use a few, and the one that works best for me is Gentle Rain so I tend to stick with that one. I paid for the full selection and was happy to (its just a small one-off fee) to get the variable timer.",
            "ABSOLUTLY 5+ STARS This is by far the best app I have ever used. The sounds are very authentic. You can download many sounds at the same time and save to your favorites. I enjoy so much, that I purchased the premium.Good deal.You won't regret it. I'm sleeping the best I ever have. Thanks to the Ultimate Sleep App. I have tried many others and none of them even come close.💯❤"

            "Extortion. The female voice is amazingly pleasant...the first few seconds. But to shut her up so you can sleep right away requires a fee. Not a value-added way of increasing app registrations. Is akin to extortion. Her monotone droning instructions are painful to endure when trying to sleep. She has a nice voice. But the instructions are annoying to listen through again and again. And again. 'Fall asleep fast' as claimed? Nope. Could not fall asleep with this app even once. :/",
            "Ive been struggling with insomnia and aniexty for a few months which literally caused me to fear going to sleep. Downloaded this app a few weeks ago and its helped me so much! I listen to it ever night and I feel so relaxed. I used to listen to the whole recording but now I'm fast asleep before the recording finishes! Would highly recommended to those suffering with aniexty and/or struggling to fall asleep!!",
            "my go to fall asleep app.... i loved it so much so i purchased the full version and i do love it,, would be cool if it recorded noise when you fall asleep becuz im a night terror gal i have them bad.. itd be nice to hear whats going on in my surroundings when that happens to me.. also sleep apnea.. itd b nice to hear how many times i gasp for breath.. but i have an app for that too lol this is greatttt for putting me into a deeeeeep comfy sleep i dont even remember falling into big thanks",
            "Amazing! Totally fixed my sleepless nights! I would give 5 stars but I always have to uninstall and reinstall app because its starts cracking during hypnosis and eventually shuts down...super annoying!",
            "great sleep app I've been using it for over a year now and is definitely a favorite. Reasonable price for extra features. Easy to adjust meditation preferences. I love the progressive muscle relaxation technique & gratitude practice. And often I am asleep within minutes of starting the app now. The night's I don't sleep easily, it calms me down and helps me relax at least."

            "A great looking app with good UX. Not the most accessable price point for me, and others by the look of other reviews. Maybe other pricing plans would be good in the future. My main issue is the short length of the audio clips. It is jarring to hear the cut as they loop again. Listening to the street scene with the rain is great, but the same car sound every 10 second ruins it for me. So much potential, I hope they improve these few things. Then they can have my money.",
            "Great app. No other app has ever made visuals with calming music. This is an innovative app design. Great job, I would like to collaborate on smth with the team as well as a fellow artist.",
            "Amazing but theres one problem... and that is: on sounds you can only listen to 8 sounds can u plz make it infinite",
            "I have the Free version only and wish I could afford the full version. This sleep app has become my source for the most effective sounds to put me in a calming mood for rest and falling asleep. I am a terrible sleeper who has fought Insomnia all my life so I've tried them all. My personal choice of sound is the Canoes tied down in water. It deserves a 5 Star rating from me. Thanks guys!!",
            "Already I can tell 2 things, upon entree this is in no way free. It is however a top tier sleep aid. HOWEVER, they do need to work on their price. They have captivating voice actors and delightful artwork as well as very nice options. But 2.99 every 2 weeks is a tad steep, I would shoot for giving the options of a monthly and or early subscriptions as well for those who are of ill funds. Especially since those who suffer the most from the lack of sleep are those without funds already."

            "Best app of its kind. I initially got the app for binaural beats and have slowly built up my inventory. I've been using Glenn's meditations for about 2 yrs now and love every one. I've notice improvement in any area I use these for with nightly, consistent use. Highly recommend for inner balance and higher quality of mind and life.",
            "Thats fantastic, it would be nice to have more of a selection of like binaural tracks and meditation music you can play after a hypnosis track. And I wish the tracks were a little cheaper because I won't run my bill up hundreds to download the entire content but I am very interested in hearing them..",
            "I use this app all the time it works I do have a request though. It would be much better.. When you select to repeat your selection over and over;. please fix it so it doesn't start with disclaimer for driving while listening or descrobing what you expect.. I'm usally relaxed or asleep at that point and it startles me when it starts over. If repeat is selected I suggest forwarding it to a soothing point of the session. 5 stars if done. Thanks either way love your work.",
            "I made a Playlist of important tracks followed by the relaxation and sleep track with a sleep ending. I am a worrier and have never been good at falling asleep. However, I have noticed a huge improvement in my sleep habits. I will be sharing this app with my team of doctors because one had asked me who I use. I'm really pleased with the app! The price isn't bad, either. I bought a few hypnosis CDs, too. These tracks are more effective and cheaper than the CDs.",
            "This app gives a wonderful feeling with all its musical effects and suggestions.. My heart rate was reduced considerably at the end of session which means am getting really relaxed. I heard some of them were not able to listen to the complete audio as they fell asleep within 10 mins. Keep doing good job."

            "A good price for a lot of functions. I mainly use this to create white noise or soundscapes to help me focus when doing paperwork. I like being able to mix sounds so I can add beta waves to static and arepeatative melody. It really helps my ADHD. It is also helpful in soothing my tenitis when I'm trying to focus or get to sleep.",
            "I would describe my exprience to be excellent. I wouldn't change a thing about the applocation and I have no idea why it isn't much more popular. The one thing that I've noticed is that there are many applocations exactly like this and I think that this is far and away the most inuitive, engaging, and easy to use. In fact, I knew exactly what to do and what I was doing onthe first try. I wish every app didn't need a tutorial.",
            "I got this app and a sleep mask with bluetooth headphones. They work wonderfully together and I sleep much better at night. There are a lot of sounds to choose from, through I did purchase all of the extras sounds.",
            "Lots of sounds Good sound system Performance is excellent Plenty of animal sounds No (noisy)(long)(irritating)ads Everything is pretty good.... But I encountered one little problem though.... ... I live in zambia (central africa) I have a VISA 💳... OF WHICH I USE TO PURCHASE GOOD'S AND SERVICES....on All my devices... BUT IT FAILED TO PURCHASE YOUR PREMIUM SLEEP SOUNDS.... I DON'T KNOW WHY.... Of which I would like to know what is the problem..... 🔄✅",
            "I absolutely loved it, at first. It had the option to save three awesome sound combinations and even save them to use later. Now, however they took all that away. To play more than one sound at a time I have to buy. Classic bait and switch. Do not get if you want to use it long term!"

            "This was quite a good app. Unfortunately, after joining the beta program, I saw that the new version about to be released will no longer include a sleep timer unless you pay a monthly fee. (Imagine, being charged to _stop using_ an app!) Maybe some people won't mind leaving this playing all night as a condition of using it—but for the rest of us, it just seems like a heavyhanded, shortsighted cash grab. 🤷‍♂️ Too bad.",
            "Decent app, I like how you can mix sounds like different types of rain / wind etc to get one that works for you to help you sleep. Have this on pretty much every night during the winter months (when my partner doesn't let me have the fan on!)",
            "I've used this app for years and have generally been pretty happy with it. It's challenging finding a decent white noise app where the sounds seamlessly loop. The recent update has unfortunately caused me to uninstall because there is no way to disable push notifications from within the app. While the option to disable the new version exists, it doesn't make it any less disappointing.",
            "I want to be honest, this app is great. The piano is my favorite melody and blends in with the house rsin and the keyboard. I was curious on what it does in the first place, but when I tried sleeping with it, it made me sleep in 5 minutes! It's very amazing. Don't listen to haters who dislike this. Good work on the app anyways! ^^",
            "Used it daily for months, by far the best brown noise app for the whole night. Clear and simple, volume independent from system's is great (especially listening to a podcast to fall asleep). Free version is fine, ads only pop up a couple of times a week when starting, never during the night. The loop is absolutely perfect. Just disable auto-updates to avoid interruption. PS: as of early Sept 2020, the \"New experience\" interface is AWFUL and unnecessary but can be disabled."

I looked for this app after 40 minutes of tossing and turning through my allotted 4 hours to sleep. On my first try, I set a timer for 20 minutes and I don't think I last past the first five. I used this app for every night per week and it's still the sure fire away for me to get into deep, solid, restorative sleep. Get this app.",
            "Well I LOVED this app... For the first night. I went to use this the next evening, put my volume up, and there was no sound. I made sure it was playing and even put my volume up to full and nothing was happening, and it isn't my device, it must be the app, because it works fine in every other app or game I have. Idk y it did this, please could you tell me if there is a way to fix this??? Do recommend if it actually works for you.",
            "2nd night of perfect sleep, thanks to this app! The combinations of sounds was exactly what I needed! Also, I use this app in my earphones walking to and from work and it alleviates my anxiety issues! So far I can't recommend it enough!",
            "Waited to write this until I had tried premium for a week and gained access to premium across multiple devices, only paying once. The sounds are lovely, lots of options and the price is literally unbeatable. It's helped my son tremendously with calming down enough to sleep and is a fraction of the cost of the \"child oriented\" apps for sleep. (Moshi 🥴) The fact that I can have premium access on multiple devices is huge as I use it as well and also for my other child."

Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits✨. \r\n\r\n⭐️ HOW SLEEP BOOSTER WORKS\r\n\r\n⭐️ Falling asleep:\r\nDeep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep. \r\n\r\n⭐️ Sleep retention:\r\nBreathing technique results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep.

I fell asleep while holding my finger over the camera lens for 10 straight minutes and woke up with it in my hand. Gimmick! How can a camera lens pick up your pulse? It cant really.",
            "The app is great to fall asleep, but the \"highlights\" of snoring/noises throughout the night is literally recorded in 30 min increments all night - and nothing really gets recorded - even at the \"peaks\". The alarm, you'd think, would be a gradual increase in volume... nope. It will scare you out of bed. I haven't been able to turn it off so I set it for an afternoon time. It would be nice to be able to adjust the narrator's volume without losing the background music/audio.",

            "This app has never worked for me. I contacted the developer for a refund and it's been 2 weeks and 2 emails and no response. I had to contact Google to make a report for developer's nonresponsiveness. Google play also did not refund me so I had to dispute with my bank. What horrible service. DO NOT RECOMMEND. FinalUpdate : Developer refused to refund even after I showed evidence of this app NEVER working. My bank saw it as fraud and I got my money back. This company is terrible. Don't download."

You can't beat it. Thank you so much. I can't wait to try it tonight and free!! Beautiful. I'm not sure of question below as just downloaded and listened to perfect sounds!",
            "Seems to work like a miracle! My sleeplessness was getting to me, and I have slept better in the last 2 nights, since using the app, than I have in the past year or so! Thank you to those who created this app!",
            "Honestly, this app is so much better than headspace. I never review things but I just had to for this app. It has so many options for sleep meditation and stories too! The paid version is so worth it too. And if you don't have money they offer free stories (which is different each night) and free meditation. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of headspace with boring monotonous readings. Great app!",
            "Well, just downloaded this a couple days ago. So I'm only just starting to use the app, but so far I'm impressed. It has a great selection. Wish I could see some in for Theta waves, but all else is already in there. Been looking for an app like this. Thanks! P.s... (hint, hint....Theta waves!)"

            "It doesn't do more than other apps who don't charge money except if you want to unlock more features. But if this one charges money after 3 uses (used it once, and didn't even record the sound) i don't think I'll give it another chance after these 3 uses. It's basic business strategy. If you want to compete with others, you need to bring more or better services, especially when it's paid. Otherwise, all people will go where they get better results for what they are paying.",
            "You lie, \"Sleep tracker app free to track and analyze your sleep\" but your not free at all! Its a trial to start and worst part you can't even use the trial without paying that is not how \"FREE\" or trial work. In the trial you only get one 5 minute meditation that does nothing for anybody. If you're going to say that you're free then be free if you're gonna be a trial then state that and let us use all the app as the trial. Waste of time!",
            "Just cancelled my subscription after 1 day. Confusing interface, didn't feel the need to be \"ranked\" with other users, picked up no sleep sounds during the night even though I was awake at one point and my report didn't load - ended up having to refresh my phone and the app. Just didn't really hit the mark with me.",
            "I only got it to record my sleep once. When slide to end sleep it did not save on 4 occasions. Perhaps it's because I had other sleep apps open 2 to 3 times. As I was comparing its accuracy to other apps. Idk.....🤷🏾‍♀️",
            "It won't work unless I allow it access to the photos, media, and files on my phone. Thank you for explaining that it's a function support, but I wish it was an option rather than a requirement."

Being able to set a wake-up timer is nice and isn't something I've seen in many other \"sleep noise\" apps. The app is visually a little rough around the edges, but the functionality is totally there. Also, cust. service is LOVELY. Prompt response and they were able to help me out with subscription stuff. I would totally recommend for the price; much cheaper per mo. than Headspace or Calm.",
            "Good app. Great app... The study section is no doubt the best in the game. I could forget everything else but my studies by just listening (headphones or no headphones). The nap section leaves you feeling well rested and ready to continue with your day. The sleep section is great, but I guess I've been using this app for a long time. This used to put me to bed within minutes of getting to bed. I guess I got too used used to what plays and the narrations. It has a hefty price though💔",
            "Love this program! It's really help me sleep. It's has a lot of options, different dream scapes, male or female voices, so I don't get bored. It is simple to use for those late nights of unrest. I've learned a lot about relaxing, and I love waking up to the quotes. They are great.",
            "When I set it to wake me up, I need to set at least one other alarm because that feature rarely works. Like... Sometimes it just doesn't work at all and I don't know how that could be possible. Sometimes it crashes in the middle of the night. It's frustrating because you pay 40 plus dollars for something and it doesn't work reliably. They are smart to get their money up front. Probably wouldn't recommend.",
            "I love the app,i used the free version for about 1 year and it helped me tremendously, its great so i decided that i will purchase the full version for 1 year when i relocated to the UAE in February, (I purchased it around March or April) It worked perfectly until now 5 September I open it up to fall asleep again and now it brings up the screen to pay again for the full version.last night it still worked. This is not even 6 months and my year paid service already inactive. Pls cn support help??"

            "I liked this when I first downloaded it, and after about a week the alarm and wake up stopped working. No soft gentle wake up music picking your light sleep. you actually sleep through and dont get woken up. I thought it might have been an inbuilt thing that when you pay it comes back. Still having the same issue when I have paid at least $60-$70 for a decent amount of time. Is there some option I have to turn on ? Im now setting regular alarms in the background in order to be woken. 🙁",
            "The description fails to mention that you have to pay for most of the features they explain. That really should be in the description instead of letting people download it and then saying \"by they way give us your money\" the free version is very basic. I'm guessing they don't say you have to pay for a lot of the features so they can boost the number of downloads they get.",

            "It works for the right age. My 4 year old is engaged in the story telling and falls asleep every time. The app is so successful, she is onto it and knows and refuses to watch sometimes. My 2.5 yo is too young to pay attention long term, but the stories do settle him down. My only complaint, really recommendation is for the app developers to offer a search option. The 2.5 yo only wants to watch the train one. And sometimes 4yo wants kitties. We are paying good money, please add thanks!",
            "This is one of the best apps. I would always be ripping my hair out at bed time for my kids and now its so easy for them to get to pick there bed time song or even story.",
            "Too costly, no monthly subscription. I love the concept, love the stories. The visuals are great, and the music that goes with each story is so soothing. However, $60/yr is too expensive for a lullaby/story app. On top of the high cost there is only a yearly subscription. The price needs to be lowered and the subscription needs more options. I feel like the cost is on the road if price gouging. The developers/ marketers know that parents are desperate for easy going sleep routines right now. 😔",
            "I love this app, which is why after my weeks free I decided to buy the app! It works so well with all of my children ages 10, 7, 4 and 2 years. We take the little 2 to bed (they share a room) we put on twinkly lights and connect the tablet up to a Bluetooth speaker and the play Moshi, we have it playing a playlist all night for them. It's helped get them into going to sleep in their own beds rather than on the sofa whenever they pass out or in my bed. So I am extremely grateful for this app."

            "i purchase the premium version thinking it would be good as the (forest app) but its far from good. theres not much to it than having bldgs. per completed sleep cycle. the alarm also don't go on if you turn off the wifi so the app forces you to keep the wifi on while charging your phone and while the app is running. it consumes alot of battery charge and electricity as well as wifi. it could've been better. i was also expecting some great alarm sounds and sleep sounds turns ou theres none. 0/10",
            "This app has made me change my sleeping habits in some way. But, I don't recommend this as an alarm app. The alarm didn't wake me up, even though my alarm was on. It's a bug, maybe? As a result, my building was demolished. I'd just recommend using another alarm, wake up before your scheduled wake up time on SleepTown, and head to this app immediately after using it to prevent your building from being demolished.",
            "This is a very interesting app which I have used a lot on another device. Building whilst you are asleep is quite amusing and after time it does help you develop the habit of going to bed when you should do. My one note of caution is that you should make sure that you are happy with all your phones privacy and security settings before doing something like this.",
            "I'm editing my review because my buildings keep collapsing and there were times in the beginning it was my fault but now even if i wake up before my alarm it says oops return to the app. Then it says your building collapsed. The only thing that I can think of is the problem is the fact my phone is an android.",
            "I love that this app can keep me off my phone after a certain time at night so that I can focus on going to bed. However, compared to its brother app Forest, SleepTown lacks in that light entertainment factor. In Forest, all the trees have names and funny little blurbs about them, but there's nothing about the buildings on SleepTown. They're all untitled and some are just a guess as to what their purpose is in this town. Sometimes my building is demolished before my wake up time for no reason."

            "Although I love the app and it's functions, it's missing a few things that would make it so much better. 1. I think it's should be linkable to music playing apps like Amazon music, Spotify, Pandora, and the like. Right now it's \"music\" option for an alarm is just saved audio files, which for me isn't music. 2. A small thing yes, but I think there's should be an option to turn off snooze. And 3. If it can't link to other apps for music, then it should at least have more options for alarms.",
            "Disappointed with the app, why do all the apps need to charge you to hear the recordings. I didnt realise this until I used it the first time, woke up in the morning to find 3 recordings during my nights sleep. BUT to hear them I now need to pay. I'll give it a miss. So unless your happy to pay £37 to hear yourself snore I wouldn't bother 😂😂",
            "MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE VOLUME DOWN!!! IT'S LOUDER THAN YOU EXPECT AND WILL JUMP OUTTA NOWHERE AT YA!!! I don't mean this in a bad way. Just if you're not expecting the alarm to go off, it will raise your heart rate a bit 😁",
            "The free version is great & does give you enough information without needing to get the premium. Very useful & helpful. Recommended.",
            "It's really good but it would be better if u didn't have to buy the sound tracking and other things inn general its good to track how u sleep."

            "I use this app to fall asleep literally EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. Easy to use, the sounds are great, the UI is intuitive. On top of all that, I recently ran into an issue with it and emailed the developer -- they got back to me right away and had a fix ready in just a few hours! Great app; give it a try and you won't be disappointed! Now, back to sleep...",
            "Nice app with a lot of excellent quality sounds. The price is reasonable and not subscription based--unlike many other, similar applications. I had a problem with a full page ad that popped up and did not have the usual X to close it--at least I didn't see it where it usually is. Since that really wasn't the developer's fault and he responded promptly to what happened, I decided to give the app another try and I ended up purchasing it. One thing I would like to see added is to have an option on some of the sounds to adjust how often they play. For example, it would be nice to hear the train sound but less frequently. Very few apps allow this unfortunately.",
            "Before I started using this app I used a loud fan to focus on, this is so much more relaxing and soothing, I just love it, I'm so happy I decided to buy this app. I'm happy but calm lol you'll love it@",
            "I downloaded the free version of this app years ago along with a bunch of others to try and find the best realistic rain sound. This one is bar far the best and most versatile, and I have since upgraded to the premium version which is even better. You can layer up to 10 different sounds and create such atmospheric and relaxing combinations. The premium version also transferred automatically to my new phone which is a bonus. I link it to my echo dot at night to help me sleep.",

            "I have tried over 5 different apps and I was sceptic to try this one. But I finally found THE ONE. So easy to use and my sleep pattern improved from the first time I tried it. It is amazing to finally get more than 3 hours of sleep. I will never delete this app. It truly changed my life. Thank you so much Developers. Looove it🤩 A few more melodies would be great though.",
            "When I changed my phone (from IPhone to an android phone) I missed the built-in option to set up the alarm without making my counts what time should I wake up if I want to sleep 8 hours or 7 hours or whatever hours. It's nice that this app does it for me. Thank you.",
            "Great app! Really easy to use and it helps you get the proper sleep (cycles) needed to feel refreshed each day! Bonus: it gives you your weekly sleep average, which reminds me that I'm not sleeping enough each night. Ha!",
            "This Is My Best Daily Used App Eveer ! I have this app on all devices.. i use it everyday to know when my body is actually ready to wake up, using a genaric alarm time is so unparctical and harmful to ur health . I love this app so much, it literally makes me live longer!",
            "It's helpful that you can choose from three options of how to set an alarm (go to sleep immediately, what time you will go to sleep and what time you want to wake up). Then going by how many sleep cycles you want to have, you choose from there. Also, there's info about REM sleep and what is involved in each sleep cycle (which I didn't know much about). Overall, it's a pretty neat app."

I started as a complete beginner and the progress is definitely visible. I've also tried many other mediation apps but the voice coaches in let's meditate suit me the best. This app is is a definite go-to for anyone looking to start in the field of meditation or a veteran. Namaste ;)",

Although there are more female voice then male voice which I hope in the future of this app to have more male voice just because of the soothing softer voice they have then a female voice. But overall a really great app, please give it a try!"

            "Frustrating. At first I was impressed with the 30 day meditation course. Was slightly annoyed the payment screen shows every time I open the app but as there's plenty of free content it was ok. I wondered if I might even pay for the premium version once I'd done all the free stuff. Then today I checked in for day 8, saw the message saying they had today's meditation ready for me and then discovered it was locked. This made me feel duped and now I don't want to give them my money. Sad. 😑",
            "Was really good for free meditations although the sleep meditations could be a little longer and had nice reminders but unfortunately thinking about uninstalling as they now want you to sign in and agree to their terms. Lots of stuff is locked. How about an option not to sign up? What a disappointment-people need easier access to this type of app, not more difficult! I had been considering a purchase but don't think I'll be doing that now as there are other easier to access apps out there.",
            "This app has changed my life. I took up meditation around 4 months ago, but only really started using daily 34 days ago( it keeps track for you). It also tells you how many minutes you've put in, and rewards you with badges for completing milestones. There are lots of courses to complete also a 30 day beginners introduction of short (around 10 mins) meditations to help you start the correct way. This really helps with my bad moods. Thanks Deep Meditate.🙏",
            "It's a fabulous app. But they have slowly started to lock 90% of the meditations unless you pay for premium. I highly dislike that.",
            "A lovely app to have! Has a lot of meditations for any emotion that you are going through. I overthink a lot and this app reminds me to live in the present either through meditation or the words of encouragement they notify you with. Highly recommend!"

            "Good white noise app. Benn using it for months and still don't know the difference between the 3 modes though! Seems to shut off if you keep using you phone for a while after turning on the noise. Don't know if that's a bug in mine or if it's designed like that. It's prefer it didn't though as often I want to keep doing stuff on my phone with the noise on to calm my baby down. Other than that - great little app.",
            "I don't really get it. There are 3 options: Night Sleep, Power Nap, Flight Sleep. When you start any of them, you hear the ocean. If you open the options, there are several other types of sounds (lake, rain, Tibetan bowls, etc.)—but choosing any of them doesn't change anything. You still just hear the ocean. An I missing something? And does it actually require headphones, or is that just a suggestion? (Who wants to wear headphones all night? How can that be comfortable?)",
            "Surprised at how effective this is. Main effect is white noise moving from left to right and back - so simplistic, it's almost silly. Other effects are automatically layered over time and change over time. Seems to work every time I need it. Only complaints are that it does not shot off when earbuds are unplugged and that there is no management available in the notifications.",
            "I find this works well for what I require, there is no one talking therefore no requirement to either get used to the voice. As I always say you have to find a voice that does it for you otherwise it won't do it for you, but I've found that this is superior Unfortunately atm it does stop for no reason before the timer runs out after about 20 minutes",
            "Love this app. It's simple and that's what makes it so appealing especially when you have to use it just before bed. I use the app mostly when I can't get to sleep easily due to stress. Works like a charm! Would definitely recommend it for it's simplicity and effectiveness."

PrimeNap's Sleep Tracker can help you analyze your sleeping patterns and correct them if necessary. Using PrimeNap's smart alarm functionality, you can avoid being pulled out of deep sleep by a well-meaning time-based alarm clock, and instead wake up gently after sleep cycle completion and thereby simulate a natural awakening.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works: Movement during sleep is known to roughly correlate with the actual sleep stages obtained by polysomniography.

The top section shows relative movement over time. Low measured movement will be a valley in the graph, high movement will be a peak in the graph.\r\nThe bottom section uses the movement information to calculate a rough estimate of your sleep cycles (numbered on top) and even individual sleep phases during each sleep cycle (Awake, Dreaming (REM), Light Sleep (Non-REM 1,N2), Deep Sleep (N3). The app uses the actual measurement (e.g. long stretches of low movement are likely to be deep sleep), averages (mainly in case of REM) and basic knowledge about sleep cycles (duration approx. 90 minutes) to create a reasonable best-fit hypnogram graph. This is why it will still show sleep cycles if the phone is placed on a desk. The app assumes that the user is actually sleeping.\r\n\r\n* How is this going to help improve sleep?\r\n- For most people best sleep is achieved through regular sleeping patterns (similar bedtime) averaging about 8 hours of sleep every day. The app is meant to assist people in finding out their exact sleeping patterns in order to make informed changes. The sleeping times are thus most important, the information shown in the graphs is mainly used by the smart alarm function.\r\n\r\n* How do you add your own nap sessions if you forget to track them?\r\n- On the third tab (Nap History) there is a button in the bottom right corner labeled \"+1\".\r\n\r\n* How do you delete nap sessions?\r\n- Click and Hold the nap that you want to delete. Select the corresponding item from the menu that will appear.\r\n\r\n* How do you resume a nap session?\r\n- Simply click the sleep button again to start a new nap. The app will automatically know that there have been previous sleep cycles and will continue there. Both sleep sessions will appear in the sleep pattern overview.\r\n\r\n* What does the button \"Phone off = Sleep\" do?\r\n- This is an option for people who turn their phone off during the night. If you turn your phone off completely, the app will count this as going to bed.

            "I like the look of the interface much better than sleep as android, but the auto track feature does not seem to work. Then I can't manually add or edit a sleep entry if it's missing/incorrect? There is nothing in the instructions for this. I wish sleep apps would focus on just the tracking and do away with the alarms and noises so the app is less cluttered. I also wish it could ignore that I have a podcast or YouTube playing for 15 mins as I go to sleep.",
            "I set an alarm for 7am and it went off this morning and I couldn't turn it off.. I had to actually restart my phone because no matter what I did the alarm wouldn't shutup. I pulled the app back up to try and look at my sleep hours.. I couldn't figure out how to see a detailed analysis. It just said I slept for x amount of hours. I got frustrated and uninstalled it. When designing an app someone will be using immediately upon waking up, it needs to be straightforward. This is not.",
            "Not a good sleep tracker. Recorded zero sound and I dont think the data is correct in the slightest.",
            "a little complicated looking interface but seems promising. I would like it to also prompt me to start recording around my bedtime. Edit: acting wonky since the Android 10 update, stops itself from tracking but doesn't record my sleep hours.",
            "This is a good app for tracking sleep and has many useful features. I like knowing how much of each type of sleep I've gotten esch night. However, some features such as the wake battery are unexplained and it just seems to set to a number and buzz every so often as it counts down. I would really like an explanation of this feature. This app could further be improved if it showed what time you fell asleep too."

Twilight may be a solution for you!\r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\r\n\r\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..\r\n\r\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter.

It allows me to play my games or read my online books to try to relax when in the midst of a migraine. Definitely the first thing I install on a new phone! Thank you so much for creating this!",
            "The first time I installed the app, I didn't understand how to manage the settings and I rushed and uninstall it. It's after some months I took out my time to carefully go through it and realized that it is one of the best screen filtering apps. I salute the developers of this app and wish you more wisdom to create more better apps for the world.",
            "Wonderful app. Easy to use. Great for those of us who get up for 30 min in middle of night before going back to sleep. Sure beats staring at ceiling for hours. The relaxing red dust storm tone is peaceful when you inevitably check your phone. Also great for going to bed as you set dimmer and brighter times. Also great for whatever went beep in the night on your phone that you don't get hit with the searchlight that iluminates your skull till your ears glow.",
            "This actually helped me go to sleep ! Im shook! My problem is...first off theres settings that im totally not comftable with nor understand. Also the whole time i was using it.. I was getting warnings of battery being used way to much & it was! Also it was using my data! To much of it! Im gonna try a different one. 😔",
            "I've used this app for over 2 years. I really like it for using my phone in the evening, and I have a small child who's often up in the night and so it's great to have the settings for nighttime use when I'm up with her. Very customisable. Highly recommend."

The daily note was amazing,now you have to scroll down explore tab to reach to it and the wallpaper was a blur of daily note which gives everyday its theme but now it's the wallpaper of sounds which is the same.You makes app confused and not relaxing soothing like before.",
            "It's a lifesaver app, helped me a LOT with my study and pretty much with my whole life, the only thing i wish you could do is to fix the problem of the alarm, whenever the phone restarts the alarm just doesn't work, but overall, this app is AMAZING.",
            "The flip over method for focusing doesn't work for me. I have tried multiple surfaces and it still doesn't work. I also would want it to go back you being able to buy the sounds individually versus having to pay a membership.",
            "I love this app! Usually I don't like sleeping music, but these songs were just amazing. I love how you can have an alarm aswell, oh and how there's a really pretty backround. 5/5!!!👌",
            "Love this app very much It not only help to kick off the start of studies but also keeps me relaxed with those soothing sounds while studies....and everyday thoughts are so related to my life it seems like this app is my an estor♥️tide♥️"

            "It's fun to see our sleep score each day, and helpful to have the app tell me what time I went to bed and what time I got up. I also like seeing the quality of my sleep. Sometimes it gets my times confused with my husband's bedtime and wake time, though",
            "I have always been such a restless sleeper, and wake up so many times a night. But since I've been using the SleepTracker Monitor (over 2 years now), I've been able to see how much Light sleep, REM, Deep Sleep, and how much time awake on any given night. This helped immensely, because I was able to think about what I did differently the day before I sleep poorly - and adjust my lifestyle so I could get a good nights sleep. I don't have to wear anything, just keep it under my mattress, and it so amazingly accurate. By the way, their Customer Service is also outstanding, and so responsive.",
            "If you want help that leads you to more restful and healthier sleep, then this is what you need. Period. The app is no nonsense and the support is spot on every time. Just do it. Revised 9/17/20 The more I use my device and software interactively the better I sleep. If you seek a good result it is essential to work with the results. If your tracker or app is faulty SLEEPTRACKER SUPPORT will get it going without question. Have a good sleep!",
            "We got the Sleep Tracker Monitor free with our purchase of a Beautyrest mattress. After positioning the sensors as directed and setting up my profile in the app, nada. Apparently I don't exist according to the Sleep Tracker. The app itself seems fine - it's the actual tracker monitor that doesn't seem to register my existence in the bed, only my husband. Glad I didn't waste money on it.",
            "Is impressively accurate for a device that is under a 20 inches mattress. I wanted to improve my rest and decided to give a shot for the Sleeptracker that came with my new mattress and adjustable bed. I was surprised, very good. Good way to keep accountability for good sleep habits. Enjoy!"

Within minutes of being on, I am passed out and finally can get some restful sleep. Its great that you can create your own mix of favorite sounds. Since creating the premium version, I do feel some of the regular options a little limited. But for free, I feel like you get a lot of choices, esp with mixes, and a great product.",
            "Excellent. The iOS version admittedly has more features, but this is still great. The ONE thing I wish you could bring from iOS is the ability to induvidually control the volume of each sound as opposed to having it all connected to the phone's volume. Sometimes the rain noises overpower the music I am trying to listen to :( But seriously, its all great.",
            "This app has gone downhill, it used to be good now it's just terrible. After the timer runs out, you can't restart it no matter what you do. Llately it just shuts off after 10 minutes, when it's set for 2 hours. The sounds are more lifelike than other apps, but this thing is so buggy it's not worth it. If you wake up in the middle of the night, and the timer has run out, good luck getting it to work again. No matter how many times I close the app or turn off my phone, it won't come back on.",
            "This app has failed to fulfill it's primary goal and purpose. What good is a app designed for those who need and want sleep? If they are left frustrated each time they use the app. The number of reoccurring ads is enough by itself, but the ones that block the functionality of the app are definitely the worst. The app does not work smoothly and when you encounter a full page ad more likely than not you will need to start the process all over again and again. The ultimate lnsult is the price!!",
            "Updating my review. Love the great variety of sounds and sound quality. The price for a premium subscription is too much. I respect the developer needs to make money but perhaps a once of reasonable price would be ok. Sorry cannot justify a price subscription though."

            "This used to be a great app. Now, not so much. The ad saturation has gotten ridiculous and occasionally the ad engine causes it to randomly stop working. This morning when attempting to launch the app, it played a 30s unskippable ad that was _extremely_ loud and I had to frantically kill the volume. Thanks for pissing off my wife, one of few things I don't need help with. After this, I could not get it to properly launch without restarting it. I'm not going to pay $32/year for the \"pro\" version.",
            "This is EASILY the best rain sounds app in the Play Store in my opinion. There is a good variety of rain types and the sound quality (in terms of audio and REALISM) is spot on. I really like \"Calm beach\", \"Rain on window\" and \"Thunder storm\" in particular... they just sound so real (especially wearing headphones). I don't know why others are complaining about Ads. Turn off data to negate that problem and the app still works flawlessly (so don't just 1 star bomb this app for that little reason).",
            "This app was fantastic until the loud 30 second ads were implemented. When you're struggling to sleep and open the app to extend your sleep timer or choose another rain sound, you're going to wake up anyone else in the room first with a surprise high volume ad. Very disappointing.",
            "I really appreciate the ability to add, and adjust music, nature, and animal sounds in volume! Every rain sound does come with preset animal or nature sounds (ex: birds w/frogs, seagulls, songbirds, campfire, wind, waves) for the most realistic setting. Which you can removed if you desire to layer the sounds that relax you best. It's always worked great for me to sleep!👍👍",
            "I have used this app for the last year as a sleep aid during a stressful time in my life. It is absolutely wonderful! Such a peaceful and relaxing choice of customizable rain sounds. Just amazing!!!"

            "I downloaded the app long ago and it was amazing , but nowadays i redownloaded it , but it's not working , and the titles format and names are appearing e.g : to add sounds ( listpage.add ) , the main page name (mixespage.first) and so on , it was a great app and i hope to use it again , thanks a lot plz help a.s.a.p",
            "So far so good. But is the fee $4.99 Forever (for real??)--& the ads stop?? Quite annoying if I'm asleep. Ugh! And why wont it play on both ear buds?? Hope it can work for me.... long time insomniac. I like the timer as well. Easy to operate...and can save sounds for different needs. Dig That!! 😊 Nice App so far! Trisha~",
            "The contents of the app are wonderful, but it crashes *constantly*. I have to restart it very often, once every five minutes or so. If not for that, this would've been a solid 5/5.",
            "I love the app it's really customizable and helps me calm down. Definitely give it a try if you're looking for something to help you slow down and/or fall asleep. My only criticism is a small one, I find it a bit annoying how slippery the sleep timer select menu is. It takes more effort and precision than you'd think necessary to set your timer at 20 minutes for example because it often will just glide right over to 30. Maybe that's just a problem on my phone. Anyways, this app is great!",
            "Exceeded My Expectations! Really impressive, very clear and understandable design. Even without paying, there are a lot of sounds to choose from and the detail you can put into your mixes is phenomenal! My favourite feature is that you can lock your phone and the sounds still play which allows me to save battery unlike on Yo*Tube haha. I hope that in the future you include a feature that allows the user to upload audio files they already have on their device and use them like the other sounds."

            "Awesome! This app has put me to sleep many times, with a wide variety of choice! Even better, even though there is a premium version, it doesn't shove it in front of your face every two seconds, and I can even have it playing in the background or when my phone's screen is dormant. This is a totally great app, and I highly recommend it!",
            "I have enjoyed this app. I have tried many of the free sleep apps. This one offers plenty of free options with less ads then others. I also cannot detect any repetition or glitches which is super important--I'll lose focus in my reading or wake up. I use the sounds for both sleeping and reading focus.",
            "I simply can not function without white noise. I've used a fan in my room for decades. There were years where I used 2 fans for the extra white noise. Without white noise I am unable to do the simplest things like using a tablet to write reviews on apps, watch television, to walk across the room, even to breathe. Forget about sex! This app is the panacea to all of humanity's problems and even to problems I didn't know I had. This app brought me back to life and solved centuries of problems.",
            "A must app to have. Since using my sleep has improved massively. Also a great noise blocker for those who may need it. I love this app and have it going all night with minimal impact to my devices battery life. If you struggle to get sleep, you must try this.",
            "Used it for over a year. I use the \"air cabin\" noise because it sounds the most natural to block out other background noise. Your brain gets used to it quick. Ive used it to block out the sound of my housemates and its massively improved my sleep."

            "This app is great and very useful but there are some problems with it. 1) You can't download the tracks ane save them offline so I can't use it at night when I'd rather turn off the data or wifi when I'm sleeping. 2) After the first track plays, the second one autoplays. There should be an option to stop the app when the track you picked is done playing. There shoul also be a timer so you can decide when the music shoukd stop. Please please fix this soon. Ty.",
            "By far the best of its kind that I've found. NOT JUST FOR SLEEP! Has options for MORNING music, nature sounds, Asian instrumental music, etc. It also has a section dedicated to mindfulness and meditation. If you choose, it will play in the background while you're using other apps! Minimal ads that you can instantly \"X\" out of. NO ads during hour(s) long music sessions. Offline mode would be nice 😊. Please name the app the same on Google Play as it appears on the screen icon and inside the app.",
            "So far so good. I used this app to fall back asleep two different times last night and it worked perfectly. I set it to play through the list of relaxation songs which takes about 20ish minutes. It was still playing when I fell asleep but when I woke up in the middle of the night it was off. Like I said; I did this twice. I haven't played with the other features yet but if they also work as described I say this app is a real winner!",
            "It sooo calming that you could do it when your : relaxing, sleeping, basically any were I think but I like to do it when I'm sleeping and no ads at all not even one . I 😍 it I give it a 100 persinte and I'd rate it five. Sooooo fun I don't care I 😍 it! lol",
            "I love this app! So many different types of music and sounds to listen to. I use them either too help me get to sleep or just to relax and chill out. I especially enjoy listening to the Italian music, most of which I grew up with. The only downside to it, is that there isn't a timer so that it can switch off automatically after you've fallen asleep."

            "This is a great sound generation app, lots of in built options, you can play multiple sounds at once, save sets of sounds to presets, set individual volumes for sounds, etc. If the devs are reading this, a suggestion for a new feature would be a configurable timer after which the sounds stop playing, sometimes I like to fall asleep to sounds and don't necessarily need them to play all night",
            "This app is truly a gem, probably my all time favorite. It's great for aiding sleep and meditation. Only problem is a couple of the effects that I love stopped working a few months ago (second of the singing bowls and windchimes). Hopefully they'll resolve this but besides that this is the elite of free apps.",
            "A tool to alleviate symptoms of depression. Listening to these sounds not only help me sleep, they help me focus throughout the day. Part meditative and part white noise, using the differnt sounds either individually or in combination is delightful. A fantastic app that has helped me through anxious moments and evened iut my energy to be more focused.",
            "So I finally pegged down the problem. If you quit the app whole a sound is playing, it will play endlessly until you force quit the app, which in turn messes up the sounds when you go back in. It all seems to stem from sounds not stopping after closing (not switching) the app.",
            "Love this App.... its free and perfect. Puts us right to sleep and so relaxing. The thunderstorm sounds actually helped my Dog with his fear of thunder and storms. He snores right through a real storm now as well as when I play the app before bed."

As someone whos never meditated before now they have all different kinds of meditations...anyone can do It!! Its improving my sleep habits and great for anxiety and changing the way I look at Things!! Thank you Aura!!",
            "Very easy to use, would recommend for beginners. Gives excellent recommendations based on your needs and feelings. Absolutely enjoy the meditations. Oh and a plus it's there's no pressure to buy anything extra.",
            "Literally just started using this app. I'm really enjoying it and feeling the benefits from the content already. This is very well thought out. It's the next best thing to working directly with a great meditation teacher or life coach.",
            "I really like it, it's a quick pick me up, as well, just by going on it, every time I feel I'm struggling with my emotions, I distract myself even before I decide what to listen to. I think it's really good app.",
            "This is a great app. It's exactly what I needed. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that, to truly enjoy the app, you have to pay $76.99/year CAD. For some it might be worth it, for others not so much. This app is the best pay to use meditation app I've found so far. Well worth it if you are able to afford it. Its free version, however, is very limited compared to its paid version."

So I need to calculate first to make sure that my REM phase will be in that 30 mins. Would be nice if you could add a feature where you also tell me when to go to sleep. Or if I could tell the app to wake me up in a larger gap (for example 90 min) so that it wakes me up at my REM phase. Thank you",
            "Since using this app, I have definitely noticed a difference in my sleep. I wake up feeling energized, refreshed, and less cloudy in the mornings. I love how it adds the amount of time it takes for me to go to sleep within the sleep cycle calculation. This app also sets an alarm directly to the default alarm app on my phone at the press of a button. There are no ads and it has a simple, easy to follow format. This app was definitely worth the download! Loved it!",
            "It does what it's supposed to. No ads at all. Everything is customizable and looks clean. Alarm itself is automatically added/handled in your phone's default clock app which I like. Thanks to the dev. for making this free app have a premium feel. Highly recommended, can't hurt to try it out.",
            "Incredibly useful, easy to understand and allows you to make a wake up alarm from the app itself",
            "I cannot thank you enouph. I have imsomnia and when I manage to sleep i find it really hard to actually get up on my alarm, as my body wants more sleep. So when I found your app, I can hae my chromebook open ready to blast a song, so when I have to turn my alarm that wakes me up off, I have to get my laptop now; thus making me get out of bed! I had some problems with bad interfact though, add more laptop support and you have my Double cosign!"

Any important places i go to - i will erase app and reinstall when needed until it gets fixed.",
            "I use it when I am away from home for white noise when I sleep.It works great. It is so much easier then taking a fan when away from home. I also use it when I am staying at hunting camp. I throw in some ear buds and I have the white noise I need and I don't have to hear my buddies snore. I am not sure what they do about my snoring though..😆",
            "This is a good app for using as a noise generator. I use it when sleeping in hotels. However, the most recent time I have used it (Oct 2020) there is a problem where you can't close the app. And even if you set the volume to off it will still randomly start generating noise. Therefore I have had to start uninstalling the app in the morning and reinstalling it before I go to bed. Which of I used it more often would lead me to finding another app.",
            "THE BEST. Customizable white noise fan noise. Does not turn off randomly (make sure you add the app to your system settings to \"disable battery optimization\" and \"apps to never put to sleep\"). In Sleep Aid Fan I set a time limit to have it turn off before my alarm clock ⏰. Great app thank you!",
            "I used to like this app a lot, but suddenly the white noise abruptly stops about 2 seconds before my alarm starts going off and its very jarring. Then, when you turn the alarm off and unlock the screen, the white noise starts again. Please put it back to the way it was where it played through the alarm and you turn it off after."

            "although the free version has plenty of options it is extremely difficult to find them. it makes it seem almost as if you have to pay for it as soon as you open the app. I almost just straight up deleted it instead of trying it out or exploring it. The only reason why I explored it further was because my therapist reassured me it was free. and I do indeed enjoy it just would like it to be more user-friendly",
            "Every update hides the free features more and pushes you even further to purchase the yearly subscription. I love using this app but I get more and more frustrated at the difficulty of using it. The new UI is clunky and annoying, and even though it's my favorite meditation app, I recommend it less with every update. This is especially problematic for emergencies like panic attacks.",
            "New update messed it all up. Loved it before, now not much I have been subscribed for about 8 months and using it daily several times...now new update messed it all up. Of course they updated it and made me adapt...darn...lol I love this app. Back to 6 stars. ADDED. I've noticed if I leave it running all day when not using it...it eats my battery, so remember to turn it off after use.",
            "Correction 10/2020: I still love the app and still use it, but last update caused me so much frustration. My most used filters are gone: \"most listened\" and \"only misic\".Please please return these . This is my most important app! I use it every day for almost 4 years and it's only getting better and better! Absolutely essential for both those, who are just starting the meditation practice and those, who already have one. This app contains an amazing variety of all possible meditation practices.",
            "pLEASe update the keyboard in your app. I cannot use predictive or emojis since your last update. Not happy😠 I have been using this app now for about 2 months. I was told about it from my yoga instructor and I love how much free content and huge selection there is. I do wish you could search emotions using your own words, not their preselected words. But this app has so much variety and it's free!! ❤️ Last update in October 28, has messed up sending messages \"thank you for mediating with me\""

            "Love this app. I could be better at using it every day. But, even just using when I feel it's needed always helps calm my mind. If you are into meditation and bettering your mind and calming your body, it helps me do that. I like the Cory guy the best, he does a 31 day starting course. Helps with the foundations a bit. He just seems like a really happy and genuine person. Actually all the instructors do. Only downfall would be, they let you listen to one or two free sets of some courses then you need to pay to unlock the rest. Which I understand the point is to make money. There are plenty of free course. I have used over 6000 minutes of free courses.highly recommend.",
            "I really like the meditations, but what really annoys me is that sometimes some meditations appear in my 'continue listening' section when I haven't even played them and there's no way to clear them from that section. I would really appreciate it if you fixed this issue. Thank you. Edit: it's the second time the app has deleted 'my playlist' (my saved meditations). It's so annoying. Please consider fixing these issues.",
            "I've only just started yesterday. But I've used meditations occasionally in the past. The variety of options for what you're looking for is amazing, and the tutorial like Playlist is fantastic for learning the habits you need for all your meditations. I already feel 10x more relaxed and focused. I tried a sleep meditation last night that made me able to fall asleep in 5-10 minutes after instead of the usual 30+ minutes it usually takes me to fall asleep.",
            "I have tried several meditation apps and I like this one the best thanks to the variety of \"teachers\" who all have different areas of expertise. On the downside, I have always been happy to pay for apps when they are worth the money but I think the price for the yearly subscription is too high compared to other similar apps.",
            "the main page takes forever to load (if it loads at all) and the app keeps crashin almost all the time, and then gets stuck in a cycle where I can't re open it bc it crashes again sessions keep crashing/going back to main page in the middle of listening to a meditation, or don't even load from the beginning. Instead of working on bugs they just add more. Wouldn't recommend. Updated 2020, still no changes"

            "Kind of helped to improve my sleep and I sometimes feel fit when I wake up but I got one problem: even though there is a 30 min gap, if I go to sleep at the wrong time I can't wake up at all. So I need to calculate first to make sure that my REM phase will be in that 30 mins. Would be nice if you could add a feature where you also tell me when to go to sleep. Or if I could tell the app to wake me up in a larger gap (for example 90 min) so that it wakes me up at my REM phase. Thank you",
            "Since using this app, I have definitely noticed a difference in my sleep. I wake up feeling energized, refreshed, and less cloudy in the mornings. I love how it adds the amount of time it takes for me to go to sleep within the sleep cycle calculation. This app also sets an alarm directly to the default alarm app on my phone at the press of a button. There are no ads and it has a simple, easy to follow format. This app was definitely worth the download! Loved it!",
            "It does what it's supposed to. No ads at all. Everything is customizable and looks clean. Alarm itself is automatically added/handled in your phone's default clock app which I like. Thanks to the dev. for making this free app have a premium feel. Highly recommended, can't hurt to try it out.",
            "Incredibly useful, easy to understand and allows you to make a wake up alarm from the app itself",
            "I cannot thank you enouph. I have imsomnia and when I manage to sleep i find it really hard to actually get up on my alarm, as my body wants more sleep. So when I found your app, I can hae my chromebook open ready to blast a song, so when I have to turn my alarm that wakes me up off, I have to get my laptop now; thus making me get out of bed! I had some problems with bad interfact though, add more laptop support and you have my Double cosign!"

            "My daughter and I both love this app for when we are struggling to get to sleep or are wakeful in the night. My daughter is 9 now but we have been using these meditations since she was a toddler. It's not just for kids either - as a shift worker my sleep patterns are all over the place, but a gentle familiar story with its soothing music can get me off to sleep when I need to.",
            "I love his app, before i got this, i couldnt get to sleep at all. But now i have it im aslepp within minuites. This app is perfect for people who struggle to sleep at night. Its amazing. 10/10. One thing i would add. Though. Is that you could rewind the video while its paused. Otherwise, its a great app!",
            "Used this with my daughter when she has some anxiety at bedtime (she is 8) and it helped alot! Thank you. Simple imaginative ideas like putting worries in a balloon and letting them float away along with muscle relaxation worked for her. We appreciate the effort that has gone into this app and it has helped. Thanks 🙂",
            "This app has several free bedtime relaxation/meditation recordings to choose from. Since it takes longer than a few minutes for my 7-year-old to sleep, we use the 15-minute one. He's asleep in 12 min - even me - if I listen! Earlier, I played bedtime story apps. My son would listen to a few of them (lasting at times 60+ minutes). Bedtime stories are great to listen to, but not to relax the mind. They keep a child up as s/he listens to the end and another begins.",
            "Have I used it enough? Not Yet! But loving my first 2 sessions, with the kids. My kids love it. I highly recommend to any family that love to read to their kids. Life get so busy we often forget to unwind in that golden moment before bedtime. This App is great reminder to unwind xx"

            "My health insurance provider asked if I wanted to try this app.  I agreed as I never really thought about how I slept.  The app is easy to use.   The user interface is simple and repetitive.   I didn't use the alarm or diary.  I used the night tracker and recorder.  I was surprised with the results.  I was surprised that i) I snored sometimes but not constantly.  (I already had feedback on that from you know who).  and 2) I spoke sometimes at night. That was weird, really weird.  Overall, i was happy to learn my average sleep times, wake up times, etc.  The data helped me manage my down and up times to make sure I was indeed getting a good 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night.  And they something happened. I had to have deviated palette surgery along with some sinuplasty.  I had a massive infection too.  The causes are beyond this review.  However, was was interesting was to measure the results after the surgery.  WOW.  My snoring went down maybe 90%. I couldn't believe it.  My sleep was much more sound.  The surgery worked.  But I could only prove it worked by studying the results over time from this app.  It is a year later after the surgery and I still use the app.",
            "Cool idea. I was interested because it allows me to connect my garmin. However, after waking it asks me to input how long it took to fall asleep, how long I woke during the night, and how the quality of sleep was. Why even connect to my garmin if I have to enter the information that it should be giving. Seems like a waste of time that I could make a diary of myself.",
            "Highly recomend!!!!!!! I updated my rating due to your response. Your absolutely right that is important. This seams to be the most comprehensive sleep app I have found for the galaxy gear!!!!! Thank you for all the information Old review Great idea and seems to track well. Gave it 4 stars because I wish they had a free trial of their upgraded plan. I don't want to invest the money and it not be what I want. Also I wish it had an auto detect option like the Samsung health, so if I forget to start it, it still records anyways.",
            "This app will change your sleep habits and make you more productive and less tired throughout your day. The tools and videos are easy to follow and the challenges get your sleep habits where they need to be. just follow the instructions for tracking your sleep and you will get a report that lets you know how your sleep is improving. you can also link the app to your fitness tracker for more tracking of habits and a more in depth report.",
            "This app isn't remotely accurate. It presents a supposed analysis of your sleep every night, telling you how much time you spent in light sleep, deep sleep and REM. These numbers it indicates are unfounded and incorrect. I had a largely sleepless night, and got out of bed several times, yet the app indicated a perfectly calm night with lots of deep sleep and almost no time spent awake. Don't get to see my HR throughout the night, which was the primary reason I even tried the app."

            "It's pretty amazing until now, I've no reason to rate it below 5 stars,Best thing about this app is when the timer ends,the song doesn't stop suddenly,It actually descends the volume and then stops the song, Hope it'll work same way forever and will never show ads",
            "This thing is great! I didn't feel like making a Tasker profile to do this so I gave this app a shot and wow it is fantastic! Not only does it control YouTube and YouTube Music but it also fade out volume before pausing the media. But it doesn't affect the volume settings at all so when you press play it is back to normal! That is such a cool feature! Anyway I recommend this it definitely does what it says it will do and it is an excellent sleep timer for your phone!",
            "I've had this app for over a year now and it's helped me out so much by turning my phone off after I fell asleep cuz if I didn't my phone would be going all night and that would screw up my battery this app has definitely been a five-star to me.",
            "Does what it says on the tin...without exception! You set the timer, choose your audio - music or, say podcast - then drift off to sleep. At the end of the time... it gently reduces the volume & shuts down. Saves the phone battery. Doesn't wake you up again. I use it almost daily"

            "First of all, I frickin love the aesthetics!! I love foxes so much and the layout is just- <3 The sounds are amazing and once I get something hooked up I'll get the other sounds! I'm especially fond of the ones that have to do with water... I'm weird, lol. I hope there are more sounds added soon!!! I am not deleting this app for a long while, it helps me to sleep!! I totally recommend :3 Sounds of nature comfort me. This is the best app I've come across so far! Say goodbye to the fan in my room! Again, totally recommend!!! Go at it, person who made this app! I support your project whole heartedly!",
            "Very good but it can be improve by adding more sound of nature, Like some soft sweet birds tone. The piano🎹 tones are nice, I suggest cool guitar🎸 tones should be included in the next update so as to best complete it usage for all age categories. Once these are included, this app will be the highest rated and downloaded of its kind. One more advice from me is that once your aim is achieved, don't let much advert to downgrade your stars, 🌟 I wish you the very best of luck.",
            "A very lovely app!! I'm quite wary about giving apps certain permissions, but this one has very much gained my trust. It's has zero ads and plays while the screen is off. It uses free audio, so some of it may not be of the highest quality, but I still personally find it wonderful, as it can play in the background while using other apps. And of course the blue light reducing festure is fantastic and has saved my eyes lmao. Overall this is a wonderful app! 10/10 would recommend. 💖💕💕",
            "No ads, wonderful sounds and music, background changes, blue light filters... what more do you want? Hands down helps me sleep. Accidentally leave it on? It stays on all night. That, personally, is amazing. I'm so happy with this, and you should get it! Sweet dreams~🌙",
            "I use this app to help me sleep, and I find it to be very effective, soothing and peaceful. My favourite choice is the ocean waves/tide option. I really like that it plays for the duration of sleep hours, ie 7-8 hours overnight without interruption. I also really like the night light filter option. Thank you for creating and sharing this. A++"

            "Awesome! 👏 Definitely worth the $5.00. Similar to \"Ambience\" except this is an Oriental/Asian flair....... suggestion: Is it possible to group in categories the sounds please? ex: all water sounds, music, birds, etc... this would make it so much easier to locate the sounds I would like to include in my mixes. Also, it would be great to play a few minutes of EACH favourite during the course of the timer. It appears only one can play for the duration of the timer. Thanks for listening!✌️",
            "Really like this app. It's convenient how you can mix a multitude of sounds without much restrictions. However, I couldn't seem to find a way to keep it playing in the background when the app is minimized anywhere in the settings, which is unfortunate. Overall though, it's something great to listen to overnight if you need some relaxing zen to help you sleep, and even has a timer mode.",
            "This last couple of days it's been so chaotic, I've had sleep issues and anxiety more than ever. I came back to this app, and decided to try the pro version. It's worth it, I set the timer and fall asleep before reaching the end. I'd just advise to correct some loops, but other than that, this app works wonderfully. Thanks to all the team for bringing this app to us, and I'd like to also thank Jessika for solving my doubts about the app, you all really care about us the users ♥️",
            "I am a light sleeper and have ringing in my ears so i have to have a fan or some kind of steady sound at night to sleep. When we go camping, i use this app to help me sleep. It has helped me many time, while camping or staying in hotels.",
            "I like this app so far. It lets you mix different relaxing sounds to create you perfect meditating sounds and then you can save those to use over and over. I also liked that when you use it on the timer, it fades out instead of just an abrupt stop. I purchased the upgrade and I'm a bit disappointed it only gives you about 8 new sounds, which are similar to the free ones."

            "Easy to use and really helpful. Woke up at 6:37 felling completely refreshed , which is a thing not many people can say! Totally recommend it!",
            "Have been using this app for a while, I can't vouch for how accurate the data is based on snoring. But the stuff it does give you, like notes, hours slept and an alarm that at least better than a normal alarm. Does scary me putting my phone on or next my bed over night especially while charging but if the phones blow up it probably take the house anyway. I love the charts section and plots. App very stable, never had it crash. Over all, definitely worth using. You got nothing to lose. 👍 10/10",
            "I've only used it 1night b4 Hurricane Laura hit, but it seemed to detect when i was in a deep sleep, I'll update again in now that my lights r bk on and I can get bk to normal....Update: It shows ur sleep deprivation, it shows if u take OTC sleep aids if that helps ur sleeping which it does w me depending on when I take it. If u have animals, obviously they cant sleep w u cause their moving counts as urs so it shows that ur light sleeping...",
            "There are two things seriously wrong with this app. 1, If I happen to wake up, I have to stop it from recording in order to view the data. When I turn it back on, it starts recording from scratch, and ignores the amount of sleep I've had already. 2, Since I work shifts and often switch between day and night at a moment's notice. I need an app that records the amount of sleep I've had over a ROLLING 24 HOUR period. I want to see instantly how many hours sleep I've had in the previous 24 hours.",
            "Very impressive. Three little requests: 1. Add nature sounds (nightingale, robins, wind, streams etc) to the alarm sound options. 2. Allow the alarm to very gently fade in over 5 minutes. 3. Allow the alarm to snooze and gently fade in again at an appropriate smart time."

            "Been sleeping with a high powered fan on to drown out noise from house & kids but have been getting severe sinus headaches from the fan blowing all night, tried this & it's great. Idk how quickly I fell asleep, but i turned it on & set a timer for 1 hour & woke up 7 hours later. I like that you can preview the other sounds before deciding to purchase premium & it said I could watch a video to use one of the premium sounds tonight, but i just wanted the fan sound. Seems like a great app",
            "💌Honestly 5☆, it is what it is! Absolutely love that I can turn off data and it still works. No adds which bumps this up to the top of my best whitenoise apps/list of all time. And you know with such a great app like this I'd definitely purchase some instore stuff just because ya'll deserve it!! Stay golden! Please don't make me come edit my review 🤪 Fkn love you guys!!!",
            "Background noise? I seriously love this app, puts me right to sleep. But a few nights now I've woken up and heard a beeping or whistling far in the background. I thought it was just me, maybe I was just hearing things that aren't there, until my husband said he heard it too! I hadn't even told him about it. Now I'm creeped out by it and need to find a new app.😔",
            "Oct 2020: This has been a Godsend. With COVID and everyone living on top of each other, noises go unnoticed with this great app. I pop in my earbuds and I can focus for hours at a time, completely uninterrupted. March 2019: Reliable. Works well. Perfect white noise to help you sleep or just drown out noises.",
            "I've really enjoyed this app for a few years. In July I decided to purchase the premium so I could listen to the rain and occasionally the spa-like music. I love the rain sound! Update: My previous issues were fixed and the company was incredibly helpful! I'm enjoying listening to the rain again right now ☺️"

            "This app angers me. It is clinically wrong. Real sleep breathing patterns involve long breaks between breaths, while your lungs are fully relaxed. This app tells you hold your breath for too long, so you're gasping for breath... But no, there's no catching your breath, you're supposed to hold it again. This leaves me feeling panic, which stimulates the adrenals, which yields the complete opposite of the desired sleepy result. Bad technique, bad science!",
            "I am a firm believer of getting a good night sleep for you to function the next day. Getting a good sleep is also very important for your physical and mental well being in general. This application is a great investment to do just that. I use this app on a daily basis and I never fail to get my beauty sleep which keeps me up and alive the next day. Highly recommend if you want to get rid of that unhealthy habit of bad sleep quality! Good job app maker!",
            "It is a easy and simple app to follow for both busy and elderly people. It not only helps in sleep but also long run lung function for better immunity against any virus. It also can help during any important or stressful interviews or examination or appointments.",
            "Good effort but a long way to go. Most imp thing to fix right now is whenever the app is minimised it stops. If screen is locked it stops. When trying to sleep you can't have phone's light shining on your eyes.",
            "Very good 👍 A little simple, but high quality... It will be good if it is supplemented with more music for sleep, relaxation, etc. Insomnia app is great 👌"

            "I love this app. It is the best one I have found, so far, which is really free. Other apps make this claim, but then block access to certain material unless a payment is made. As a fairly novice meditation practitioner, I found this app invaluable because there is a beginner's course and intermediate course. Following on from these courses there are a variety of packs for different situations. From daily meditations to managing stress or anxiety, for better sleep, for walking, e.t.c.",
            "Wow, this app is 100% quality. There is content for every situation and it is free. For those of you who are tired by commercialization of meditation apps - this is an app for you. I like that there is a simple customizable timer. Although I don't understand what offline / online mode means in the context of it. Seems like the meditation track is streamed anyway. Developers, could you clarify what that feature does?",
            "Hands down the best app I've ever had for meditation. I've used so many other apps but this one is the only app I've actually stuck to using. The interface is so seamless and so easy to use. And it's 100 percent free. No sneaky purchases or special meditation packs. That sort of transparency is much appreciated and I honestly wouldn't mind donating or paying. I don't know how to support you guys other than this, if there is literally any other way to help, let me know!",
            "After trying several meditation apps (Simple Habit, Headspace, Atom, etc), I like Medito the most because it's simple, user-friendly, and beginner-friendly. All sessions are free and the selection is well curated, which I love because what frustrated me with other apps is that too many options can be overwhelming and having series wherein some episodes are free while others are paid can stunt one's growth. Their \"Getting Started\" collection is useful particularly for a newbie like me, as many of the other apps do not offer in-depth tutorials on what to expect and how to practice correctly. As a cherry on top, I like the options for background sound, especially Spring Field. The audio is balanced well with the voice, so it's not too loud nor soft, and it plays seamlessly. It seems like a small thing, but it's something that had bugged me and turned me off from other apps. If I had to nitpick - it would be wonderful if you can expand your collections under Sleep Meditation and Mantra Affirmations as they currently only have a handful each.",
            "This is my first meditation app and I find it very well made. You can pick what kind of meditation you need as the sessions are divided into sections. The voices are very calming. I've been meditating for about 4 months now and I can see some improvement in managing my stress and being a nicer person in general. Thank you guys and keep up your work!"

            "I started and got very aggravated immediately. The guided meditations are extremely rushed. There is no break in the talking to allow you to find the \"safe\" place she is talking about, or to take the second deep breath before she is on to the next topic. Far from relaxing. SLOW DOWN that is the point. There are better meditation apps available. Don't waste your money on this one. Disappointed 😞",
            "There's just not a lot of variety when it comes to the content. I expected way more when you sign up for a subscription. Also, for what you DO get, the meditation are average at best...... Money wasted 😕",
            "Love meditating! This app really helps me focus on the meditation as it guides you through the process for each one. I do however, think that the prices are very costly and I am on low income budget. As traditional medications either do not work, have too many interactions with other medications, and having extreme adverse reactions to medication, I do use meditation and other integrative therapies. Also, I would like to see muscle relaxation meditations.",
            "Wish there was ZERO STAR option. Terrible business. Created a \"plan\" for me and once I paid to get said plan, the plan needed me to buy EXTRAS to access \"plan\"!!! SCAM. SHAM. SHAME ON YOU!!",

Relaxation Meditation\r\n2. Sleep Meditation\r\n3. Stress Relief\r\n4. Motivation\r\n5. Quit Smoking\r\n6. Guided Imagery\r\n\r\nWhat is guided meditation?\r\n\r\nIf we were to use a metaphor to describe it, we could say that guided meditation is like the two small wheels that are attached to the bicycle of children who learn to ride. They use it to make their first pedal strokes without falling, but the goal is, sooner or later, to get rid of it.\r\nIndeed, guided mediation is mainly aimed at beginners. By offering step-by-step support in the first experiences of meditation, it serves to support those who do not know how to go about it or who are just afraid of doing wrong.\r\nHere, instead of two small wheels, it is a voice that accompanies us in our first steps. And all we have to do is follow it.\r\nGuided meditation sessions can take place both in groups, with a guide, and on their own, using an app or video. In all cases, a voice will guide you throughout the session. With an often calm and slow intonation that will call for relaxation, it will help you reach the right state of concentration and relaxation to let you go into meditation.\r\nTo explain it better, we can use a second metaphor: guided meditation works like a GPS. It shows you the path to follow to avoid that, at each intersection, you don't wonder where to go.\r\nThe voice will explain to you how to proceed at each step so that you always know what to do without having to think about it yourself. The goal is to help you go through an entire meditation session without giving your mind the opportunity to frolic all over the place and to ask yourself all the time whether you are doing things right or whether you should you do it differently.\r\nLike the two small wheels and the GPS, guided meditation is especially useful during your first sessions. Indeed, after a number of them, not only will you know the path to take, but you will also need no help whatsoever to move forward. By that time, the guided meditation will have reached its goal and you will then be able to meditate alone ... unless you prefer to go a long way with it!\r\n\r\nWhy use guided meditation?\r\n\r\nFirst, it makes meditation accessible to all. Firstly because no prior knowledge is required to start guided meditation, but also because, by taking us by the hand, it allows us to discover a world that may seem intimidating at first.\r\nBy accompanying us and showing us the path to follow from the start, guided meditation thus breaks down the many barriers that we can erect in front of us at the time of learning meditation, such as the fear of s '' put it alone and make mistakes, lack of motivation or not knowing where to start or having trouble learning on our own.\r\nIt thus helps us to take the first step towards meditation. But more importantly, it also helps us do it right. Step by step, it teaches us the main concepts of meditation so that we can make them ours. It helps us find the right posture, the right breath and the right approach, and teaches us what to focus on during a session. Nothing is left out, so you can be sure you are learning without making a mistake.\r\nFinally, guided meditation is responsible for answering, implicitly or explicitly, all the questions that often mistreat our concentration during our first sessions, such as “am I doing well?”, “When will I finally get to make a vacuum? ”,“ why does this seem not to work for me? ”or“ should I think of something else? ”. As a result, you can focus on the essentials instead of letting your mind fill with many questions that, without guided meditation, could go unanswered.",

            "Thank you for adding the new relaxation and believe in yourself meditations. However the voices are very quiet I can barely hear them and it would be nice if you added some background music to them I love the background music and the good quality of the voices in the older meditations; wonder if you can keep that in mind next time you add more please keep up the good work. ❤️ I've also noticed that the app keeps shutting off \" \"error accessing audio file\" msg could you please look into.",

            "Why doesn't it start when sleep is started? It used to work, but stopped after some update months ago. I have to go to Google Play store, find the thing and open it each time before I sleep, otherwise it won't connect with the watch or at least very rarely. Update: it's the 'Auto start' permission that was missing, not the battery saver configuration - just as I described above. Update 2: nope, still broken and does not start or report error. BTW the play|pause buttons on the watch never worked",
            "Was working very well, only connecting when I started tracking. Recently however it connects to my Samsung Watch 3 throughout the day, giving me the notification \"connected to your Samsung Watch, tap to cancel\". When tapping to cancel it will only go away temporarily after a huge delay, coming right back in a couple of minutes.",
            "Starts randomly throughout the day, draining my battery. Ill burn through my fully charged battery in a matter of 5 or so hours if I don't catch it and turn it off. The only fix I've found is by putting it in the \"always sleeping\" list but then it doesn't work at all. Frustrating.",
            "Integrates seamlessly. I've used this since my gear S2 and now I have the Active 2. No problems, no issues with battery drain. Minus a star because Samsung Health tends to recognize more accurately actual awake moments, but this app combination records sound and I like that.",

If I get in my car with the Bluetooth stereo it will start coming through there even if i restarted my phone to shut it off earlier I will have to do it a second time Other than that I really like it",

            "Going to sleep away from home is always a consern for me. Most of the times I toss and turn but after using this app. I've been able to sleep throughout the night. This app has helped me many times when I travel. I love this app because there are diffrent ranges of fan noises and speeds. You can also set a timmer to the sound. I found one that I specifically can sleep to. So now I'm not concerned when I travel.",
            "Simple app to make fan sounds, great to get to sleep with. Unfortunately it shuts off randomly, sometimes before i fall asleep and through out night. I set timer for certain time, but when it gets shut off randomly i have to restart my timer. Very frustrating please fix. Also, animation shows fan spinning...why? Its not a real fan, its just to listen to for sleep, that is a waste of app memory. Just worry about sounds and shut off animation. Lastly, i recently noticed it shows ads related to my google searches. Pretty weird fan application knows my search history!!!!",
            "Amazing, I have been using this app for years and it has never failed me. I recommend 10/10. No ads, just what you're looking for. The fan sounds are great, it is the perfect tool to use to help with sleep.",
            "When I had an iPhone, this app worked really well. However, now I have an android and the fan stops after an hour or so, which wakes me up. To be fair, I do not know how much time has passed by the time I am alert enough to realize that the reason I am awake is because the fan is no longer playing, but you can see the point. I use the app for white noise and when it shuts off, I wake up. This is helpful if it turns off when it should but it doesn't seem to work that way on an android device.",
            "I've used this app for a long time and it helps me get to sleep even with my tinnitus, but the recent change to the time style makes it more annoying to reset when it shuts off. I wake up throughout the night and liked the old style of a click the arrow for an increase of one hour at a time, not the scroll wheel. Also can I please get a version without ads, I'm willing to give you $0.99 for an ad free version and would like that a lot. It's a good app for what it does and will continue using it."

            "Useful and great as a tool generally speaking. I would however change 2 things about it: 1. If you get up in the middle of the night, it should show how long it takes to fall asleep instead of having that be \"restless\" time. 2. There should be a nap setting. It assumes every time you're in bed is for your full goal (I think it automatically sets to 8 hours) so a 20 minute nap gives you a sleep score of 10 and messes up your average. Makes it less accurate and reliable.",
            "The app is informative over time, but improvements could be made. Two things I would like to see are related to favorites and sleep tracking. Regarding the favorites, I'd love to have 2 favs since raising/lowering the bed is otherwise multiple presses which is an annoyance. As for the tracking, I have pets that like to sleep on my side of the bed during the day.... Imagine my surprise the first few times I saw sleep tracking during the day while I was at work. I wished I were still in bed!",
            "The app works very well. The bed looses wifi quite often. The bed tells you how you slept. But you can't control your sleep. So im not sure it helps a lot. Many times i have woken up groggy and it says good things. I have also woken up rested and it says i didn't sleep well. Still haven't figured out what the HRV means. Doesn't seem to mean much. I do love my bed though.",
            "This is a very cool tool to use. It took a couple of days for the bed to get to know me, but, as time goes on - it seems to be a bit more accurate. the one thing i didn't like was when it counted a nap as my actual sleep time; I could edit that out if i wanted to so it didnt' mess with my averages. All in all...i think this accurately reflects how i am sleeping each night",
            "I like the suggestions offered and have adopted a few successfully. I like to read in bed because the adjustable bed is awesome for reading, but it lowers my score. I know reading in bed is not the best sleep hygiene, but it works for me. I'd like to be able to adjust for it. The new hrv is interesting and I am paying attention to it. My Galaxy watch records a different amount of restful sleep than SleepIQ, and so did my Fitbit. I also would like a nap setting."

        "recentChanges": "The ability to turn off battery optimization for our app from the app settings. (Available for Android 6 and above). This will prevent our app from closing or shutting off unexpectedly.",
        "comments": [
            "Very easy to work with. You have multiple sounds and different types for each sound category, like different rainstorm sounds. Helps me sleep and I can turn off my phone and the noise still goes. Definitely recommend for ppl who need a portable white noise machine! The reason why I took 1 star off is because after a while of using it, the sound would randomly stop working in the night and I would have to back into the app to start the noise again. Other then that i love this app!",
            "Very nice app, my little son and I loved it, thanks alot :) I have a little playback timer problem though, the timer doesn't work anymore. I set the time for 30 minutes but the noise keeps on and on all night that forces me to wake up in order to turn it off. Noise used to fade out beautifully in the past but after the last update this problem appeared. I tried re-installing the app and I tried the battery optimizations thing both Watson and off, All in vane ;(. Please help",
            "Tried quite a few apps and this was our favourite. Fine tune your own custom white noise is a great feature. Simple and easy to use. Biggest feature request...Just wish I could pay to turn off ads. You can customise the background colour. Would be nice to be able to customise the icon colour also. Overall does a simple job well.",
            "The best low frequency sounds. Other apps sound higher pitched , this is the closest to a real fan ive found Edit: Still love the app, but it would be awesome if there could be a setting for volume to be independently controlled from media. If I have this running and want to watch a short video, I have to turn it off, as the app sound level is the same as the video's since they're both on the \"media\" sound level. can't make one louder without making both louder.",
            "Love that I can have this on airplane mode and on for as short or as long as I like. Love the variety of sounds, each of my children found a different sound soothing so great there is variety. This worked a treat when we were out and about in a pram, kept them asleep longer than without it. Love love love. Only downfall is not being able to use your phone for calls during its use but to me that's quite minor."

            "This app is great and I use it every day for sleeping and gaining control over my mood and emotions. I especially love the sleepcasts! However, I think a nice bonus feature would be to save our favorite programs so they are more easily accessible (meditations, sleepcasts, etc) so we can see them in one spot instead of having to tap through the menu. I tend to go to the same ones which are my favorites. Thank you for the awesome app and discount for students!",
            "Literally the best white noise app I could have ever found! Helps put me to sleep and my nieces when fighting there sleep or when there overwhelmed, this goes a long way to help soothe them! I honestly could not be with out this app, it is guaranteed to be phone, iPad and any other technology I’m around. It is a must or I can not sleep!!!",
            "I have trouble shutting my mind off at night. This app is great! Helps me sleep swiftly. You can customize the background noise and put a timer on it. It comes with some preset options, too. And it also has some relaxation recordings and bedtime stories. I can’t say if the stories on here are interesting as I fall asleep quickly when I play them. ???"

            "After a less then great experience with an ad popping up as soon as I tried the app, the devs responded within hours to say they adjusted it. I reinstalled the app and was able to test it and I ended up buying one of the sound packs. The app lets you adjust secondary sounds so they occur at different intervals. Few apps let you do that so it is a nice feature. The app has a nice UI. I am looking forward to seeing how the app develops.",
            "Excellent sound quality, very easy to use and efficient for me. Having used soft music to go to sleep for years now, I was looking for something different. I tried several sleep tracking apps, but if they were good for going to sleep, the tracking part I don't need turned to be a battery sucking experience - and an expensive one. Zleep is my best choice so far and the diversity of the \"sound universes\" is a joy to explore. Keep up the great work 😎",
            "Relaxing sounds. It's great for studying or programming when you need white noise to block out office noise and other distractions. I like that I can customize each scene and turn off any sounds I don't especially like. Try it with headphones!",
            "Amazingly simple app Very quick response from the developer when I highlighted flute music was removed in recent update. Now my baby can sleep peacefully. Thanks, keep up the amazing work.",
            "Loved this application. Had a great experience with it. This application have sounds which will provide you a comfortable sleep.👍👍"

Soon I'll be falling asleep the minute I turn it on! I would purchase additional work by the creator but none seemed a good fit. I think I have what i need for now. Update, its been over a year now and this is still worked into my nightly routine. I find it soothing, pleasant and most importantly restful♥️.",
            "Very relaxing and puts me to sleep nearly every time! Favorite out of all styles (eg nature sounds, lullabies, etc), and I have tried dozens!. If it had a timer to go along with the loop feature, it would get five stars. That being said, it is infrequently that I need to listen more than once since it is amazingly effective. Shazzie truly does understand the flow in which various body parts will relax; and her voice is so calming; but the background music is just a bit low. Huge fan!",
            "Relaxing, even after years of listening. I used to go through so many meditation tracks as I would get sick of hearing the same voice, but I purchased the sleep easy and the love your body meditation, and 6 years on, I'm still loving it (at least 4 nights/week). Shazzi's voice is so comforting and the music is deeply touching.",
            "Shaz's sleep meditation is the complete package. The body scan, affirmations and calming music are a near perfect combination. I'd like a new release or few other meditations for 5 stars.",

When my mental health started to decline those roadblocks became mountains that seemed too large for just an app to overcome.

            "Exactly what I need! A lightweight, simple app with a variety of sleep and soothing sounds. We use it all night and every nap time for my son. We co-sleep part the night so I put it on in both our rooms, and I'm sleeping much better myself now that I'm not being woken up as much by random noises. I think I'll sleep with white noise on for myself indefinitely! It's great.",
            "No good with ads. Often the noise stops by itself or starts pausing. Currently the brown noise goes on for 2 minutes then goes off. Trying to re-install to see if that helps matters. Used to be brilliant but now pop up ads come up which startle baby or stop sounds. Quite annoying as app itself is good",
            "The ads are too loud in the free version! The reason we use this app is to calm down the baby. But suddenly ads pop up and wake up the baby completely. We understand it is a free version and ads are necessary but they could be at least without sound.",
            "Adds pop up when you need to turn on/off the music. The baby loves sleeping with this music but after he falls asleep adds with sound wakes him up. You have to wait a lot of seconds before using the app. You can\"t switch it off by closing all apps because it runs in the background. The price is very high for switching off the apps. Too bad. It was my favorite before this. Now I have to uninstall it and find another one.",
            "I've used this app with both my kids and its been great. But the recent introduction of ads with sound is completely ridiculous! I'm trying to get my baby to sleep and change the white noise type and get a ridiculous loud ad that wakes her up! It completely defeats the object of an app to help with sleep. I'm uninstalling and will use another."

            "Very relaxing, is played everyday. I use this for my son to fall asleep and with the timer it's great. After 10/15 mins, he's normally fast asleep. Sometimes I play it for myself to go asleep too or just have some peace, time to do mindfulness. I love all the different options and sounds available, it's beautiful. 💜 The adds can be very annoying and if you hit the back button on your phone, it just stops the app. Other than that, I'm so glad I downloaded it.",
            "I sleep SOOOO much better if I listen to Nature Sounds. I set the timer for 2-4 hours. My favorite is the campfire with piano and wolf or chimes!!! I am also SOOOO happy I can play this app without being connected to the internet. Bonus!! 💖😻💖",
            "Lovely choices of soothing nature sounds to choose from.You can also add other nature sounds or music to make a layered effect. A timer is also available so that the app doesn't run longer than you want! EXCELLENT! 🤩",
            "It was very good app for relaxation nr it was the best ......bt now this time I'm facing a lot of issue with sound cracking......if I add another sound then it's not clear ......the sounds are so amazing bt due to this i am facing a lot of issue ...... Without this i just love this app....please fix this......... supporting team .........nr reply me first ..........",
            "Truly love this app. You can start off with just rain or fire or something else basic. Add in music or night/day creature sounds or all of it! So very versitile, and fits any and every mood so far!"

            "I began using this app instead of the one I was using (which was just different rain and thunderstorms). I am really enjoying this one! I have had a glitch here and there, don't mind the ads as they only play in the beginning.. I know they're coming so I turn my phone down until I have the story ready... the stories are great, so many of them to choose from, will more be added? I haven't made it through one entire story yet! Lol sleeping very well, thanks for keeping it free to use!",
            "While I love the concept and there are a few very talented story tellers, EVERY time I've used this app, it stops after about 10 minutes. Just as I start to relax, boom, it just stops. And no, it's not the end--it stops in the middle of the story. My search goes on for a nice sleep app.",
            "This is what I was looking for, the app where they finish the story. I find them very calming, most of the voices are pleasant and it's nice to combine a little relaxation as they do at the beginning. Thankyou for this calming app full of wonder.",
            "Love this app. I don't usually make it more than 3-5 mins & I'm out. I was looking for free sleep stories or a free app because I won't pay a monthly or yearly fee for Calm or Headspace. This app folks the bill & it has SO MANY stories & sounds! Thank you!!",
            "This app is exactly what I was looking for ,its all FREE! all the stories and music are FREE! the stories are amazing ,the voices are very calm and soothing.i definitely recommend this app for everyone...all the stories are appropriate and soothing for kids and adults...if you are reading this definitely consider this app.."

            "For such a high tech, expensive and niche device -- this application is lacking way too many simple, basic functionalities. How is it that google home integration hasn't been done already? Alexa was done years ago! Also, my warming functionality didn't end with the timer once and I woke up in the middle of the night over heating. I contacted costumer support and all I got was yes, it was a bug. We fixed it -- try again. This happened for 3 nights in a row! Also, why is the default timer 20 hours? Is anyone in bed for 20 hours? Like I mentioned -- is lacking so many basic features.",
            "Functionality has decreased. More errors than ever before. Glitches out. Very disappointed as it used to work seamlessly.",
            "What you ACTUALLY just did, is literally DESTROY the connection and pairing...now, after a year of flawless operation, my bed won't pair to the app and nothing is working. Great job!",
            "This app has me on the brink of returning the entire mattress and smart grid. Since the update we have only had two consecutive nights of the temperature being correct. We specifically changed our internet router to a compatible mesh network solely for the purpose of making this bed work. Since the app and wifi are the only means of controlling the hub/temperature, something that was a terrible error on the design team, more often than not you end up with an expensive 'dumb' bed. Fix the app!",

It's not a score we made up. It's one of the most important findings in the last century of sleep science. It's important because when your sleep debt is low your daily quality of life is better and you live longer. When that number is high, the opposite happens.\r\n\r\nRise teaches you what Sleep Debt is, how it works and how much you have.

Maybe your mind is active at night or you might be staying up late scrolling or watching Netflix.\r\n\r\nBased on your input and the latest sleep science, we'll recommend habits that help you finally feel better.\r\n\r\nSleep Challenges we can help with include:\r\n- Getting to bed on time\r\n- Difficulty Falling asleep\r\n- Waking up during the night\r\n- Feeling groggy in the morning & during the day\r\n\r\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\r\nEvery one of us has a clock in our brain. It tells every cell when to be alert and active and when to be recovering. We all have unique times during the day when we feel and perform our best. We also have individual times when we should be sleeping and waking up. We use advanced algorithms to let you know when your peaks are and the best times to be sleeping.\r\n\r\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\r\nUsing data already stored on your iPhone we automatically track how much sleep you get. No buttons to push, nothing to wear, or charge. We integrate with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle, and other sleep trackers to put the data you already have to use. Rise integrates with Google Fit for step and activity data related to your sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER FEATURES\r\n- Configure habit notifications through SMS.\r\n- Keep track of your sleep quality.\r\n\r\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\r\nWe started Rise because we’re in the midst of an insufficient sleep epidemic (CDC, 2014) that is getting worse since we started tracking in 1985. The current epidemic is leading to higher mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) and we’re performing worse in nearly all aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\r\n\r\nToday, most of us think of sleep as a luxury.

            "Concept good, app is not working properly. It took some weird sleep times off of my phone so I adjusted those the best I could remember. Then it started recording times off of phone movement, counting it as sleeping for 2 hours. In the morning, between 6:40 and 8:40 when I'm getting ready to go to work. And although you can report the inaccurate time but can't delete it so it counts towards your sleep depth. Uninstalled.",
            "This app is amazing .I've been using for such a short time and i already love it .This app has already helped me address my sleep issues head on and i am working on it. I already see a change because of this app .This app is easy to use and user friendly. Great layout of the app .A great all for all ages i highly recommend this app.",
            "This is a great app . If you want to get into a good place mentally then your sleep game needs to get in shape and this is the best possible starting point you can take . This is much different then any of the other apps I've tried as this offers a solution to your sleep issues .",
            "Just really needs work. Times wouldn't take, brain dump says error and then have to wait until main page reloads. **Could** be a great app but atm it's frustrating to only access half of the features they show. Frustration isn't ideal for better rest hahaha",
            "Glitchy AF. Literally would not accept the times I tried to tell it that I went to bed or woke up. It decided it would only accept certain times. Better be an upgrade faster or I will ditch this waste of time."

            "Rain helps me sleep it always has. A couple hours probably seems like awhile for running time. But when the rain stops I wake up and have to turn it back on, just wish it was non stop :) It's a really good app. I've used it on and off for i think 5 years. Love it",
            "I love this app and have had it for years. The only problem I've had is that the sounds gets real quiet and then real loud. And it's not the loud that bothers me. It's how quiet it gets. It wakes me up sometimes and I wish there was a way to turn that off. But other than that, wonderful.",
            "This is a great app. It has very realistic sounds and great sound options. My only complaint is that the app shuts off before the timer ends and sometimes the sound gets staticky. But overall it's a great app.",
            "Absolutely love the app. I like being able to adjust the specific volumes. Now I just need a way to cast this to my Google home.",
            "Excellent. Very realistic sounds and I Really like how you can regulate the intensity of all the storm elements. You can even have flashes of lightening. Superb."

            "the app is great, at least the alarm-setting aspect of it, but the white noise playing thing is quite the opposite. The tracks are looped and while that works perfectly fine with the fan noise, the fire and the rain have a very easy to recognize pattern to them, which doesn't help you fall asleep but in fact does the opposite because my mind finds the pattern and keeps following it as if im listening to some king of limbs style music."

            "Edit: The 11:26 is the intro, it keeps going after that ends, according to your settings. This app is the first thing I install on a new phone, I've loved it for years now. It has helped me cope with unmanaged insomnia, chronic pain, and severe migraines. I often just rewind the initial relaxation intro if I don't fall asleep the first time. He has a lovely soothing voice, with a pleasant Scots accent, and the guidance is just what I need to calm my racing ADHD brain during times of distress.",
            "Have had this app for years, we refer to it as \"the Scotsman\". When I want to get to sleep fast, when I'm having trouble getting to sleep or wake up and can't back to sleep. \"Let's use the Scotsman?\" Love it.",
            "I've had this app for years now, and have loved it and recommend to many, but recent update has changed a lot. At first I thought it was just the look of the app and that's fine with me, but I actually think there is a now less content, it's only about 7mins long, and though you can put on repeat, previously it was far longer and no need to repeat",
            "I LOVED this and many of Andrew's apps. But the new update changed one thing that I do not like. If the session is repeated... There's a new part where his voice is louder and woke me up every time it played... Before I wanted it to wake me. I love the new look of the app but can I have the old version back????? Please????",
            "I have used this app for years. After the last update, I can only listen to 11 minutes and 26 seconds. It will not allow me to listen to anymore. I would like this fixed or a refund on my purchase. Thanks"

I love the mixing options and volume control. I also love that you can set a play timer, and it tells you what time the recording will stop. This will help me sleep!",
            "I love that you can pick different sounds, mix them together. And I love the volume, it wasn't to bad, it was, perfect! But.. Don't download if you don't like, nature sounds or ASMR. My only complain is there isn't that many options."

I saw in a reply to another review you make this yourself, so I'm not tryna complain heaps, just I'm kinda disappointed that it only worked 1 night.",

I set the timer for 20 minutes, which relaxes me before bed. Nirvana!",
            "I think this app is awesome. I use it every night and love pairing relaxing music with nature sounds. Now you can even adjust the sound volume of the nature sounds to the music!!. The issues are how long it takes to open the app, can sometimes take a really long time. And also the music randomly stops sometimes and sound is at 100% on start up which is super annoying. It's still a good app with a lot to offer but could use with some fixing."

Our sleep calculator will help you fall asleep and wake up in the most natural way and help you get your day started full of energy and with a smile on your face.\r\n\r\nWaking up in the middle of a sleep cycle can leave you groggy and ruin your whole day. Our app helps you find the perfect moment to wake up or fall asleep in order to maximize your sleep and keep you fresh all day.

Also, if a text or email comes in, it automatically pauses the app and it has to be restarted then, too. It should quiet for notifications, but should come right back on. I almost paid for the premium service, but I am really glad I didn't. I'll be uninstalling as soon as I leave this review.",

You may also see a contextual Rest Mode suggestion if your body temperature is elevated, which can be a sign of strain.",

            "Works okay, but I keep messing out my score because I keep forgetting to add my workout instantly and when I try to do so before going to bed, a few hours later, I cannot do it because midnight has passed and the app doesn't let me add workouts for the previous day. I find this very frustrating, and I see no reason to why, since I haven't slept yet.",
            "After using the ring for a full 6 months, I've found it more helpful than smartwatches with sleep tracking that I've used in the past, specifically for tracking trends in when I go to bed and when what I do before bed. This has lead to a significant increase in the quantity and quality of my sleep. Hoping this is just a start. Thanks, Oura.",
            "UPDATE: 3.4.0 has fixed the Android sync issue The most recent app version will not sync at all. When I purchased the ring back in July, syncing was fast and worked every time. Oura has a knowledge base article about this problem but apparently it's not a high priority. To top it off, you can't control syncing, it happens every time you open the app.",
            "Sleep is the most important thing to my wellness as I age. Sleep impacts all aspects of my body, mind, emotions and cognitive performance. I have a stressful job and Oura gives me measurable sleep data that I use to precisely manage my energy, and time better through proper sleep. I'm so grateful for Oura.",
            "Good, but could be better. Lots of information is withheld from being shared to any other apps (ie steps are not sent to Google Fit). Also, information which can be exported to other apps are only done so upon opening the non-Oura app, and only for that day's information. Otherwise, the sleep tracking, heart rate data, and other data obtained is quite informative and useful. For such a small device, it packs a punch!"

            "Truly an amazing app! It's mine and my husbands lifeline to always knowing what's going on with our son without having to play the guessing game! It's been especially helpful with us having to both work from home and not be able to afford a nanny or trust daycare (he's so young). We use the free version and are impressed I can only imagine what the paid version is like. If I have other kids, better believe this is my go to!! Lol",
            "Brilliant app, especially for first time parents like us. It helped us learn our daughter's patterns and daily routine and, as a result, spot when she wasn't feeding as usual and did in fact have an infection, which we were able to seek help and treat promptly as a result. Would recommend it to anyone!",
            "This app has been a Godsend!! The sweet spot is right on. I no longer have an overtired baby who won't go down for naps. Wish I knew about this sooner. I've been telling all new mom's to get this as well!",
            "LOVE this app! The sweet spot for wake windows for my baby are spot on, and I really like how I can record everything from how long he sleeps, to how long he eats, and even record his diaper output. It's so helpful to have all of his sleep recorded in the app because I would never be able to remember it accurately myself. The app is very easy to navigate and I also like the helpful tips for each new month. I recommend this app to every new mom I know!",
            "I love this tracking app! But as a mom to a newborn and busy 2 years old, I do find it time consuming to enter the app and switch to list view every time I want to check when the last feeding/pumping session/nap time etc, was. It would be nice to have a widget, or some type of \"at a glance\" option that could stay on my main screen that I could refer back to for when I forget what time I did something last. And being in that sleep deprived newborn stage, I forget a lot these days!"

I can't pay for the timer, switch it back to free.",

Also the timer that has been put under \"premium\"? Whut, why? It was amazing, but now it's all about the money.. Also I can only sleep at the #5 track, but when that one is finished playing it will go to #6 automatically and I'll be wide awake again.. Why can't we put the song on single repeat or so? Way waay better!!",

            "I love this app. Guys keep up the good work. This app is amazing, it helps me relax and sleep like a baby. It took away my anxieties i had before. This app is my new bestie. Well done👏",
            "Took a couple of tries to get into this but worked well, 20 minutes is a long enough time to relax and drift off to sleep. Good idea!",
            "Really good but when I learnt I would have to be paying for it I lost interest in the app but the rain sounds Melody and everything is great especially for people like me who love hearing rain sounds while sleeping",
            "Its so good. I sleep reallllllyyyy nice. The rain, the wind, thunder and sound of falling on the roof, this combination is absolutely amazing. I wish there's a sound of cat purring though, and sound of fire crackling in the fireplace during a snowy winter days. It's fantastic minus ads."

            "A good app to log your sleep times (manually) and get useful stats like sleep efficiency. Sleep efficiency stat actually made me realize that I can convert some of the time I spent in bed not sleeping can be converted to actual sleep. Issues: 1. Tracks only 8 weeks of data before one has to reset the data. I don't see any option to extend the same time series, which is disappointing as I was looking for long-term sleep tracking. 2. Though it asks for the sleep times during the day, it doesn't incorporate that in any kind of stats. It doesn't even show the average of daytime sleeping. Hoping to see the improvements in future. Thanks!",
            "I thought this would be perfect to log my sleep habits. It's very simple and easy. However, there is no settings to adjust the clock to not be military times, it asks how long you woke up for during the night time but you have to list an exact pm/am time, instead of just 5 minutes or 10 minutes which makes your total sleep time incorrect. It's not accurate.",
            "What's the point of a sleep journal that doesn't understand that people can get into bed BEFORE midnight, and go to sleep AFTER midnight? Every one of these apps have this same stupid problem. So here I am logging info for my doctor on paper. So dumb.",

This app has worked to relax me during the times when I've most struggled to take care of my body's demand for sleep. The mixing feature is lovely because it lets you create your own little world full of sounds at varying volumes. I've tried things similar to this app and never had much/any impact in relaxation. Recommend it as worth a try to others with chronic pain and anxiety.",
            "Lots of different sounds. Many restful (though some are not). A timer can be set, so you save power or just want a nap. Great for drowning out the neighbor's party and if you set it on infinite, it will cover the sounds of the other neighbor's illegal rooster (rooster don't wake people up, people do, right?). The only fault I have found is the strange UI, which has text below the buttons that do not apply to the button.",
            "I have a hard time staying asleep at night. This app has helped me out greatly!!! When I wake up at night I just got my app and it plays different relaxing sounds that put me right back to sleep!!!! You are so greatly Welcome!!!!!!!",
            "So far, so good. Really like the train. New sounds haven't been tried yet. The ability to combine sounds is really nice. Still waiting for rain on a metal roof. That's the most relaxing sound that I know of. Great developer not only added my requested sound, but added some other really good ones, as well. Wish I could give it more stars. Thanks."

You can find music of almost any instrument with a lot of songs for the same instrument, music from various countries and music for relaxation and concentration and much more. A great app but it could be better if their was an option for download as well.",
            "This app is a Heaven sent. I have a very active brain. Most of best creative ideas have been at 3am!!! At 74 yrs of age I need my sleep. So after 35 yrs of insomnia, failed efforts to find a way to get some SLEEP , I have finally had a full week of rest and complete night's sweet dreams and slumber. You have saved me. I have 1 good thing to come out of 2020....seriously. I play the music waltzes of Vienna. ZTHANK YOU FOR SAVING WHAT EVER TIME I WILL HAVE FROM NOW",

I love the fact that it has a variety of sounds the guitar the violin the piano the flute many other sounds of music together with the sound of rain is definitely a powerful mix",

A friend back home who had struggled with sleep for years also uses this now and said is the best she's ever used by far. Definitely recommend giving this a go.",

For an ad-free experience and additional features, please purchase Sleep Log Pro\r\n\r\nWe suffered from insomnia for decades, with all the usual symptoms that result from rarely or never getting a good night’s sleep: constant fatigue, fuzzy memory, mood swings, diminished cognitive capacity, symptoms of depression, weight gain.\r\n\r\nBut our approach for dealing with these persistent sleep issues was haphazard at best. It wasn’t until we finally decided to take a systematic approach to tackling our sleep problem based on the principles of CBT-I, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, that we finally solved the sleep puzzle.\r\n\r\nOur quality of life has improved enormously since then. Sleep is no longer a hit-or-miss proposition. Going to bed at night is no longer coupled with the stress of wondering “will I or won’t I…?” We now have the tools, methods and strategies we need to consistently get a good night’s sleep almost every night. \r\n\r\nAnd on those nights when sleep remains problematic, we no longer suffer stress and anxiety connected to insomnia–instead, we’re confident that our brain will apply its own internal methods to ensure we make up for the sleep deficit during the following nights, as long as we continue to track our sleep and potential correlations.\r\n\r\nSleep Log is built around the concept of sleep efficiency. Sleep efficiency is defined as the length of time asleep divided by the total time spent in bed. Successful approaches to sleep therapy are generally based on gradually improving one’s sleep efficiency and thereby training the brain that bed is associated with sleep. \r\n\r\nBut we go much further, helping track moods and activities experienced during the day that can have a positive or negative effect on that night’s sleep. Sleep Log currently helps track 14 factors grouped by moods, activities and chemicals–such as anxiety, exercise, and caffeine intake–on a daily basis, then correlates those factors with your sleep patterns. Here’s what we help you track, all factors that can positively or negatively affect your night’s rest:\r\n\r\n• Happiness\r\n• Excitement\r\n• Stress\r\n• Anxiety\r\n• Daylight\r\n• Exercise\r\n• Meditation\r\n• Work intensity\r\n• Screen use\r\n• Tobacco use\r\n• Alcohol consumption\r\n• Sugar consumption\r\n• Caffeine intake\r\n• Sleep medication\r\n\r\nWhat Sleep Log Free doesn’t do\r\n\r\nSleep Log is a sleep and behavioral diary, logging, analysis and visualization tool, not a traditional sleep tracker. We don’t use automatic methods to track the duration or quality of your sleep at night. In our opinion, app-based methods for tracking sleep are generally unreliable and usually require keeping your device very close to, or even on or in, the bed, which itself can disturb your sleep rhythms.\r\n\r\nIntense focus on tracking and visualization of your nightly sleep cycles can also lead to a unhealthy condition called “orthosomnia”, an obsession with getting a perfect night’s sleep, which will have precisely the opposite effect than intended. \r\n\r\nYour sleep cycles will vary naturally depending on your sleep needs any given night. You’re the best judge of how well you slept and how rested you feel. That’s why we use your own subjective estimates of these vital factors, rather than trying to tell you how you should feel based on a chart.\r\n\r\nFree version\r\n\r\nThis is the free version of Sleep Log.

I'm pretty tech savvy and was frustrated with not being able to figure out what date is what with my entries...",

Improve the \"hour selection\" (it rolls down or up sometimes) Possibility to have an average of the month and not total.",
            "Finding it hard to believe insomniacs developed this app and didn't give an option for same day sleep. I downloaded this app to track my sleeping patterns because I suspect I may have DSPD, and I want to have something to show my doctor for a referral. I always fall asleep past midnight and wake up late in the day; like yesterday, I didn't get to sleep until 5:30 am and woke up at 10:40 am. I tried putting this in the app, and I couldn't make it work. Seems like a useful app, but can't use it.",
            "Not a bad app, seems to have good features. Unfortunately, I couldn't use any of them because it doesn't allow you to log that you fell asleep past midnight. It says I slept for 20 hours when I slept less than 7. I work a late shift so I'm never home by midnight. If this one thing is fixed I'd love to use this app, but until then it won't work at all for me",
            "i had alcohol one night out of 8 and now it says my alcohol is lower then average. no alcohol is my average its not lower then! i also had one set i saw on the charts looked off, i went back and it said id been awake for 240 minutes through the night. i fixed it but the charts still dont update that information and looks off. the biggest issue is the time scrolls for sleep and wake up, it doesnt snap too well it rolls making it frustrating to pick the time. fix these things and its a 5 star."

            "I love this app. Super easy to use, has great functions like being able to extend the time limit through the notification bar instead of needing to go back into the app, and has many customisation aspects. I have genuinely used this app nearly every night for years and when I bought my new phone this is the first app I reinstalled. So many similar apps make everything needlessly complicated. This one is simple, and it does simple so well. Love it.",
            "🔥🔥🔥This app is essential for anyone who likes to listen to something on Bluetooth earphones/buds while going to sleep! 🔥🔥🔥 It lets me set a timer to automatically turn my Bluetooth off, which then saves the battery on my earphones, meaning less charging! I've been using it for for a couple of weeks now and it works great. 5 stars well deserved 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Thanks to the developer/s 👍",
            "Anyone with elevated security needs would do very well to take a look at this app. Hackers are trending towards alternative radio bandwidths to case your networks and jack your info, so obviously a solution that'll maintain information integrity via your bluetooth, NFC, data,and wifi connections-not just data alone-seems a given. Security solutions in this arena are surprisingly rare, and even more rarely effective. This app seems an impressive start in that direction.",
            "it doesn't do what it's supposed to do. already checked battery optimization, and the rest of the settings. timer counts down to zero, but the wifi is still on. Uninstalled.",
            "Works as needed to turn my phone Bluetooth off over night so my wireless earphones disconnect and therefore don't use up all their battery and need constant charging. Would be nice if I could set it up to repeat everyday rather than need to manually load the app each evening, but it does the job."

            "This is a great app with amazing soundscapes. My only issue is the sound quality on my LG Stylo 4. I tried this on my girlfriend's iPhone 7 prior to using it on my phone, and it sounded perfect with the same headphones. When I downloaded it on my phone, the audio quality was noticeably worse and quieter. Other apps like Spotify sound fine, it's just this app for some reason. Also, a driving mode would be neat.",
            "Really like the simplicity of the app layout and the sounds are beautifully put together. would like to sample the personalised experience ! Any plans for compatability with Garmin watches for heart rate monitoring etc or is there a way to set this up?",
            "it's almost perfect :) melody could be used a little more, even if it incorporated some of your favourite artists or genres to create small bursts of melody or something that helps with the rise and fall of the tracks.",
            "Great App for experiencing offline ai-powered music for various occasions. Music is rich and dynamic, tailored to one's preferences. Listening never gets boring due to (bi-)monthly theme changes. The UI-design is fabulous! Daily listening makes you feel more calm, focused, refreshed and less stressed. You will already feel a difference in the first hour of listening. After a few days of regular usage, the effects start to last longer and are more intense. Excellent experience so far, 10/10!!",
            "Relaxing white noise! Exactly what it says. The option of tweaking the sounds for your mood is fab. Note: I did get a certain music stuttering while using wired earphones connected through a dongke to my Oneplus Nord. Likely it is a connector issue as it was not found while listening on my OnePlus buds. Just mentioning it as I saw many reviews of similar manner here."

Preparation  >  Bodyscan  >  Externalisation. Safe for beginners, kids, and those with special needs. If you are a beginner; if you are experienced but short on time; if you are stressed; if you want to slip into relaxation effortlessly; if you want to get back into practice; if you want to build up to longer and deeper nidras, this is for you. You can even do this one sitting up!\r\n\r\n* Track 02: Deep Relaxation (24:35) (In-app purchase)\r\nThis is a longer practice that takes you safely and systematically through eight stages to a state of deep relaxation. Friendly to beginners, kids, and those with special needs. If you want a thorough reset; if you want the full experience regularly; if you want to develop habitual relaxation; if you want to build up to longer and deeper nidras with full awareness, this is for you.

It visualises the seed syllables of the Sanskrit alphabet at the cakras, the psychic-energetic centres of the body — an authentic tantric practice called mātṛkā nyāsa, the original practice from which the rotation of consciousness in contemporary nidra is derived. You may use it regularly — after some practice with tracks 1 and 2 — to create deep healing and energising effects, to explore the layers of the mind, and for your own spiritual work.\r\n\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\n- Do not use while driving or operating machinery.\r\n- If you face challenging mental health conditions, please seek advice before using the longer tracks.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT\r\nFor more information about yoga nidra or the app, technical issues, or bug reports, please write to me at kanya.kanchana@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nREFUNDS\r\nRefunds are possible only within 48 hours of purchase under normal circumstances.",

            "This app is an incredible way to practice Yoga Nidra. The teacher has become really special to my wife and myself , after daily use for months. It is so humbling to be able to practice with such an experienced teacher without leaving the house, however the exercises are very, very powerful and you will travel far if you practice. Definitely pay for the longer practices, totally worth it",
            "I've used other apps and usually they give more free tracks. This one only gave one and so I didn't think it was worth buying as an app. Also it appears there are only 3 tracks. The 10 minute session was ok, however, because there was no sankalpa, this is not authentic yoga nidra. I do not recommend this app. It needs more work done on it.",
            "This is without a doubt, hands down the best app I have ever downloaded. Exponentially more than tai chi, Kundalini yoga, lifting weights or running marathons over the years it has brought me to a state of mind and baIance I never believed I could achieve in this lifetime. Thank you, I should have written a review years ago when I first downloaded it.",
            "Update: this has been my experience. I don't appreciate being called a liar. I have provided feedback to you via this review. I made an in app purchase and only one track is available. Update: this just is not true. It only unlocked one track. Be aware that each in-app purchase only unlocks one additional track. They don't seem to update the tracks so this app gets repetitive. I think there are better options available in the market.",

            "Can hardly make a story play! They stole nearly all of the story's from another app called calm(calm is amazing best sleep ive ever had with it)! Stories won't play and my sound doesn't work on this app! So many bugs, using this app makes my phone go to 100% to 30 in 10 minutes. Do not download this app, Ive had the worst sleep in years. Download calm because it has all these stories that actually PLAY and more. Please fix all the bugs and get your own stories and maybe I'll redownload(unlikely)",
            "I've been using this app for nearly a year and it never wants has failed me. It gently helps me fall asleep every night and if I wake up in the middle of the night I can hit play again and boom back to sleep I go. When I find a particular reader whose voice I particularly like I can search by that person and find more stories that they've read. This app gets too big thumbs up.",
            "Never had a single story play. Hit play and the circle would spin and spin...nothing. The only thing that works on this app is the adds. Would have loved to hear the stories. Many looked interesting. Guess I will continue to search.",
            "Awesome! I was asleep within mins, highly recommend. It's totally free and you get to listen and learn new things. I play this every night :)",
            "Great meditation course for free from Jeff Warren. Ads are disruptive. Would be willing to pay to remove. Need to reinstall the app to stop it from spinning in each story."

            "\"offline\" is in the title, and it truly is. I turned off wifi & data signal & it still works. The sounds are fantastically real, even for coming through a tiny cell phone speaker. No need to sign up, make an account, or purchase anything. As far as ads go, just turn off your screen. Actually & truly free.",
            "Great soothing noise selection - but shuts off randomly. If you need it to be on all night while you sleep, this is not for you. I am a light sleeper, and work opposite schedule from my housemate. Having a continuous sound is what helps my brain relax and sleep, but having it suddenly cut off actually wakes me up from deep sleep. Love this app but can't use it. It doesn't keep doing its one job, and the sudden stops trigger anxiety. Oh well.",
            "Nice! The sounds are quite good. I esp. like the rhythmic \"Wave Crush\" (you probably meant \"Wave Crash\" tho, right?). There are so many nature-sound apps—some, with only ocean sounds—but the waves are almost always constant rather than rhythmic, which is so much more relaxing. Suggestion: It feels jarring how the whole screen moves when you select a sound. How about putting the empty rows at the top and adding sounds there, so everything else doesn't have to jump around?",
            "very calming and helps me with my anxiety, even when im not sleeping :). i really love the addition of sounds that arent entirely natural, like the gentle whir of the fan or the train. id love for an ambient chatter sound, too. the nature sounds are a bit repetitive, though, and could use more variation and spacing out. overall, cute and gets the job done.",
            "The best app I have found to create an individualised combination of nature sounds thats just right. This app gives you lots of choices and so much control its a perfect mindfulness relaxation backdrop."

            "Love this app for my 4yo who is hyperactive and needs to listen to something to sit still. I play it over Google Nest in his bedroom to control it during naps and nighttime. I wish the app could cast the sound. Instead, I have to cast the whole device audio, which isn't as stable and not as easy to manage between devices. Add this feature to get 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟! Also, the interface is a little clunky. I'd like to see the length of each file without having to open and play it. And download all.",
            "This is extremely effective for helping my kids fall asleep. We were all very excited. However, the recording kept stopping in the middle. I did some experimenting and found that if I download it, push play, and push the infinity button (in that order) it will make it through! I don't mind doing this since I am paying 4x less than similar apps. It seems like they are working on the issue.",
            "I like the content so I finally downloaded the app and purchased the subscription. Ever since I did that my app has been glitchy and stops within the first few minutes of the recording. I went to check the app on my phone and cant find it anywhere to be able to clear the data/cache etc. I dont feel like it was worth it to subscribe.",
            "Great app I can fall asleep within like 5 minutes of listening to it and my little sister loves it all I think is that it might be nice to have a new adult/teenager series that would be nice for people like me because my imagination is not that big and I think there are lots of people out there who agree with me..... Thank you for reading this! ❤😊",
            "This is my family's new favorite sleep/rest/meditation app! I am SO happy to have found it! You get several sleep stories/guided meditations for free (which made me happy, I never fell asleep faster in all my life), with the option to purchase them ALL for $7.99 (that means you get ALL the stories-no ads, no gimmicks). They are adorable, relaxing, simply wonderful-perfect for imaginative people, spiritual people & those simply looking to develop healthier sleep/mental health habits. Enjoy!"

Does anyone know how to do this? The reason I ask is I randomly woke up at 3am thinking I hadn't set an alarm, momentarily forgetting that I didn't have work that day. So I set the alarm to my usual 5:20 time, but now I can't find a way to cancel it. The only thing I think I can do it set a sleep now alarm for long after I when I want to get up, and hope it cancels out the first one?! Anyone got any suggestions?",
            "Better rating if the spelling error of \"Fuxed\" was changed to \"Fixed\" and if menu also showed actual Sleep Cycle count next to each time.  It still has best combination of features when I compare it to several other similar apps.  Many other similar apps do not have all three modes of Fixed Sleep Time, Fixed Wake Up Time and Sleep Now.  Before you criticize this app, learn the purpose of it as explained by this Google Store page and also try other similar apps which are less feature complete.  This app has greatly helped me adjust to my ever changing work schedule as long as I am careful to always sleep in the cycles suggested and never cheat or snooze!"

            "Thank you for making this app completely ad free. I was looking for something that will work with Google Fit. Unfortunately this app doesn't have the new \"Connected App' feature to transfer sleep data to Google Fit. I only tested this for half a day so I'm not sure if this app shows how many hours of total sleep per day. I only see individual sleep logs. No option to see graphs like other apps. Good effort but needs to be updated and upgraded with more features and functions.",
            "This apps works just as I need it, however to be able to track and see if actions I am taking to improve my sleep are working I need to be able to view more recorded data over time. The last 15 records barely covers two nights of sleep activity.",
            "Wonderful app, but just 15 sleep records?! Why? Also, I expected \"Sleep settle\" to subtract from my manual log time to account for the time it takes me to fall asleep.",
            "I like the app but it needs more things like charts that shows your sleep data for a week or month. Also, put some \"best time to wake up\" options. Thanks and God bless.",

I listen to the puddle rain sound effect and the pause is very noticeable and makes it a bit more difficult to immerse myself in the noise to sleep.",

Its a great app for relaxing sounds. the meditation recording is also a good one. some sounds are for the pro-version, they have the little lock on them. However, for each one i wanted to hear that had a lock on it I only had to watch a short video to unlock it. totally worth it.",
            "Its free and it's an all time experiance. It even gives you the option of showing their premium side. There aren't even that many ads. You only get one and per sleep sound. Like if you pick lake, you get one and. That's it for the rest of the time. You even get a timer!!!",
            "It's exceptional I had not use such a great app we can make any sound using other sounds but there is one thing which I disliked u should have to download all sounds once and u are also asking for the money for free trial but it's OK there is also the download option I would like to enforce everyone to download this app this would be a better experience",
            "Great app. I just used it today. It just seems like thike it doesnt keep a log of the times and /or days you meditate. A log, would be nice in order to yo keep tract of how often and how long one meditates. Will provide another review in a few weeks."

            "Perfect for what I needed. Has the rain sounds and sleep sounds, plus you can add in thunder, birds chirping, sounds too. You can set the timer if using to fall asleep. Only thing I don't like is it keeps playing when a phone call comes in. I have to tell the person to hang on while I try to shut it off so I can hear them. I try not to answer the phone as much as possible, so it's not a deal breaker or anything. Overall I love it.",
            "I am really loving this sleep sounds app I find it every day to use it provides a nice variety of sleep sounds. One of my favorite features is that you can combine sounds and save to use again. My best go to is rain with a bit of crackling fireplace. Really helps too put my mind at ease. So far I'm only using the free version and I'm very thankful it offers so much.",
            "Perfect rain sounds lets you change the volume for each sound, add or remove sounds to create the most relaxing combination, and set a timer for how long I'd like it to play Unlike other white noise thunderstorms, I don't find the thunder predictable - which honestly helps me relax. Only the occasional ad at the start of playback, and nothing intrusive during the rest of its run. I couldn't ask for anything more",
            "It's fantastic! Especially how you can add sounds into each different setting of rain sounds, choose time duration, and the volume! It's very soothing for when you need some help easing into a nap or falling asleep.",
            "A good sized collection of rain sounds. It has got some amazing white noises that helps me fall asleep really quickly. Had been using it for a year now and quite pleased by its performance. Ocean waves and other thuderstorm sounds are my favorite and they feel very realistic too."

Somnia helps you shutting out thoughts by letting you focus on progressing and developing soundscapes with ASMR content. Attention to triggers in Somnia is important to feel the tingle, for your wellbeing and can help you fall asleep faster, restoring your mental health.\r\n\r\nSomnia uses Spatial 3D Audio for dynamic binaural audio. The 3D ASMR sounds evolve like small stories, creating a believable and immersive experience that restores your focus and helps you fall into your ASMR sleep. \r\n\r\nWhat you hear in the app won’t just be simple sounds playing. Instead, we continuously blend and mix several sound components into one stream, and we call these streams “Aubits”.\r\n\r\nSomnia includes a variation of aubits categorized by themes. Sleep sounds are produced by professionals in the sound field and recorded in HD to create a genuine combination of triggers that tingle.\r\n\r\nWe want you to enjoy Somnia for as long as possible. Therefore, to avoid the fatigue of hearing the same repeated sound loops over and over, we randomize and humanize the changing audio to keep the listening fresh and believable. Each aubit is layered several times, so its timbre and expression will always sound different and natural.\r\n\r\nUse the More / Less buttons to nudge the AI to play what you like\r\n\r\nTRY IT OUT! Somnia has a Free Daily Access as well as free 7-day trials. Download it now and try for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Daily Free Access is a duration in which you can use Somnia for free on a daily basis. During this period you have full access to the app.  In the Subscription settings, you can see how much time you have left of your daily access. Once the daily access limit is reached, the app will pause. You may choose to subscribe to get unlimited access or wait until the next day where you again can enjoy Somnia for free for a limited duration.\r\n\r\n\r\nListen to compositions or build your own by adding and dragging aubits around your head in 360 degrees. Save and enjoy your favorite soundscapes at any time.\r\n\r\nRelaxing is as important for your body as it is for your mind.

            "Doesn't let me listen anymore without paying, so I assume there is a trial period that starts when you install it--which I was not aware of. The price you're asking is kind of steep, actually, considering there are plenty of free white noise videos/sites available. That said, when I COULD still listen to sounds, it would often stop on it's own or start to cut in and out, and sounds often wouldn't play when I put them in. Far too buggy to spend money on, even if I had the money to spend on this.",
            "I didn't even get to try the app. It just kept saying 00:00:00 daily access remaining and trying to sell me a subscription. Oh well back to YouTube ASMR. At least I can try a content creator out.",
            "Too repetitive, and has a formulated feel. and I do not find the appeal in having some guy whisper about basketball. It's off-putting tbh. I read a study that said over 30% of what ASMR is all about is personal attention and I couldn't care less about sports teams and their scores. I like the ambient sounds though and I'll need to give it a little more of a chance when I feel like I need the help to relax",
            "Great content, though I need even more, ha. I like the different take on ASMR, even if I don't use the app to sleep..yet",

            "Sorry, but I was disappointed by the music. Musical standards have fallen far over the last 20 years. (If a group like The Beatles appeared today, I'm sure people would find their music too complicated to enjoy.) This pianist sounded self-taught, and the \"songs\" were the typical unimaginative, repetitious two-bar phrases you hear everywhere now. I'd find it too annoying and discouraging to fall asleep to. I'm giving it 4 ⭐ anyway because I realize I'm in the minority. 🙄",

There are some reviews saying it doesn't work but both on my HTC 10 and now Razer phone it works fine. Make sure to set the options from the drop down on the main page. I have checked with music, YouTube and Netflix and all work fine! So Mr Dev, as the meme goes, \"Shut up and take my money\" and you will get 5 stars!",

            "I love this app. I listen to a lot of YouTube audio series before bed, and being able to set a timer to close the app helps me save battery and data. Would like more time, as it currently caps out at an hour, but otherwise an amazing app I use everyday!",
            "When it works it is absolutely great! On a few occasions though, it didn't and I woke up again because it was still playing. But generally speaking, it did what it is supposed to.",
            "I used to love this app, and I mostly still do; however, it seems to have stopped working on YouTube Music. I'm not sure when this change happened. However, YouTube Music is my main app for music, so it's a bit of a pain. This app continues to work wonderfully for all of my other apps, and I would love to raise the rating to 5 stars if and when this feature is fixed. Thanks for your hard work in making this app!",
            "Very simple app allows you to have a sleep timer for apps that don't have one, like You Tube music, or ones that have an almost hidden one like Google music.",
            "It really is simple to use. Just select app from drop menu, drag or type in number of minutes required and then tap the set sleep timer button. All on 1 screen. Works perfectly on my Nokia 3.1. A note on app size. This app is only 2.2 mb. Most other apps I looked at were 3.3 or even 6 or 7 mb. Happy to recommend."

            "So... I am a new android user and I just didn't like how the alarm app for my phone works. So I downloaded this Alarmy app and have been using it for 100 days now. It's super simple and easy to use and you can totally depend on it. I really like the mission associated to the alarms. Initially I chose the \"shake\" option and it really helped me get up. I know setting an alarm is a simple thing but alarmy makes this experience a tad bit better. I love the messages at the time of exiting the app.",
            "No muss no fuss. Set the alarm for your preference and you are done. Not a lot of useless suggestions. You can set it easily as a recurring alarm for meds etc. Even as a quick alarm (reminder). I previously downloaded 8 different reminders, alarms and deleted them all after trying each for a day. LOVE this one. Caveat: I have been using for a few days now. I don't mind the ads as much as having them among my alarm settings and unable to close or delete them.",
            "EDIT: Bug fixed, app is now working without ads and in app upgrade prompt. Premium features available with Play Pass. Star rating updated... From 10/21 Subscribed to Play Pass just to have this app with \"No ads or in app purchases\" as promised in the description. Complete falsehood. I even deleted and re-installed the app. While there were no 3rd party ads at first, there were still in app ads asking to upgrade to premium, which would be an in app purchase. Now the 3rd party ads are back too.",
            "Hello, I love this app so much as this is the only alarm that can wake me up, I can say that this is very useful for me especially for classes, I have to wake up early. But the problem is that, this app works totally fine to my old phone even if it's on silent mode but when I switched to my new phone, I can't even hear it alarming, can you help me with that please?",
            "This app stopped working and the alarm did not go off. That is unacceptable. I need an alarm that works 100% of the time not only 90% of the time. I updated my program and I am going to give this app 1 more chance. I think it is more a problem with my galaxy S8 phone than app."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized.

            "Confusing interface that's hard to navigate and understand. Especially on the 'clock' screen for each sleep cycle. I spent a good few minutes trying to figure out what the times in the summary at the bottom meant since there are no labels, and the colors are the same ones as on the clock, but they don't correspond at all. It does have some good info on the different types of sleep pattern though.",
            "Takes some figuring out but it's pretty good to use. I wish it had a save feature though so I could experiment with other schedules without messing up my main one. Update: it doesn't always go off to wake me, doesn't track sleep correctly (duration etc), it woke me up 30min later than was set. I'd like it to adjust based on when I punch in to sleep, rather than manually having to adjust when I'm running late. Also I'd like to set multiple alarms after, because it's hard to wake up sometimes.",
            "The app is good, but not the quality system nor some info. What u call a 100% quality sleep it's messed up, it's really bad. good concept tho. Edit: Actually, it's not about personal preference, it's comproved that at dawn you have more REM pressure, so you get more REM. At dusk you get more deep sleep, so sleeping after midnight will have a significantly impact on deep sleep quality and sleeping after mid-day impacts REM sleep. A core needs to be placed near dusk so you get enough DS.",

Combined with the moving image and colour it was so very calming. Wonderful! Highly recommended. First time round was fine, subsequent use was no good as it only lasted for 2 minutes. This is no longer any good so I'll probably delete it. Final opinion is - useless!",

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Definitely what I needed. Waking up to this alarm is alot easier than hitting snooze several times before actually getting out of bed. Using this I'm actually fully awake by the time I set my alarm to get out of bed. The interface seems strange to me, but there is a video when u first open it to show you how to use it.",
            "Tried this for a week and there are too many bells and whistles for me. I'm just looking for calm alarm tones so I don't wake up miserable in this hellhole of 2020. Also, while I get ads, a whole page Facebook ad as soon as you wake up is the opposite of calm. Also, it doesn't save settings easily, so if I go in to change the time of an alarm, I have to also set every little thing back to my liking. Too much for me,but clearly works for others so give it a try to see if it fits.",
            "Exactly what ive been looking for One problem though is that, whenever my phone is below 20%, the no-sound, light-only alarm i set up at sunrise sounds VERY loudly. I use an old phone as alarm clock so its battery sometimes drains. I'd like for it to simply not ring and let the battery empty (like, make it be my choice)",
            "Mornings are so much easier! I'm not hitting snooze AT ALL. I can't imagine waking up to a shocking, obtrusive alarm sound ever again. I have recommended it to coworkers and friends. Why isn't everyone using this alarm??? Great app, thanks Gentle Wakeup!",
            "Has helped curve my terrible snooze habit, and waking up is definitely a better experience. Bought all the features, just for liking the free version so much."

            "Don't pay for this upgrade, it's waste of money. It has giant daily ads that block the whole screen to ask you to subscribe...wth? If you close the ad, the app hangs and won't start. Have to back out of the app & reopen every.single.time. to get it to work. Super annoying. Other than the issue with paying and still having ads, the alarm works great and has been very useful. IF you decide to try this app, just use the free version. Wish I had stuck with that.",
            "I'm a user since 2015. This app used to be the go to when it comes to cycle counting sleeping apps. But now lots of other better options out there. However, the support for the app is below performance. Bugs kept counting this since past year. Now the app works sometimes. I wake up seeing a graph of a straight line of wake up state nearly every day except for some days it works . Why? No idea. Not battery optimization. I doubled checked nothing",
            "use it everyday and its great. only two things i would change is to let me change the alarm time after it has gone off (rather than snooze, push back the alarm a couple of hours), and 2, have it recognize naps as different from nightly sleep so your stats make sense.",
            "No update for 2 years. There's an ad for a service that probably doesn't exist that you have to get rid of every time you open it. The only reason I use it is because my company's health plan gives points for using it. Does azumio even exist anymore?",

I did have a problem with the tracks cutting out, but customer service fixed this as soon as i asked so if you have a similar problem, don't assume it's the app. It was just the settings on my phone and super simple to fix. I am glad i bought the lifetime subscription. Hypnotherapy works well when I can't sleep and that is priceless!",

They are always in a very light grey font which no one over 50 could possibly read. I wish I could attach a picture because they will bold things which can be read perfectly, so about 6 to 10 words of the entire email are legible and the rest of the email is lost.",

            "So beautiful! A sound not readily available to us Land Lubbers! The timer is very handy for ,y children. The water noise can be a distraction but the Beautiful Whale song, with music, took us all away on a magical dream! Thank you!",
            "Very relaxing. Lends itself for deep meditation and connection to the Mother Ocean and our brothers and sisters, the whales.",
            "Amazing app. What I like most is that you have the option of pure sounds of whales and dophins with no aditional music. If I could, I would give more than 5*"

This app helps me get into a calm state and helps me drift off into a deep, comfortable sleep. I still can't stay asleep long, due to pain issues. But it helps me stay in a longer rem sleep cycle. Thank you!",
            "Great app. I love the timer feature, so I know my phone is not going to its drain battery all night. There's various sounds with individual volume control which I love. Always helps me fall asleep and stay asleep all night.",
            "Maximum on timer is only 90 minutes. Wish there were options for a longer period as I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and will fall back asleep if sleepy sounds are still playing. Also some of the sounds are static-y and sound a little fuzzy even though my speakers are fine.",
            "The sounds are great & helpful . Now will someone please tell me how to make it shut off. It keeps turning it's self on. If i must i'll unistall it. So for now only 2 stars!!",

            "This is so relaxing and I could not ask for more, it has so many sounds to choose from!! The 1st time I tried it I fell alsleep in less than 5 minutes! This app really helps when you are going through a rough time and you cant sleep! I definitly recomend it! Please! If you are looking for a sleep meditation app that you need, espiesly if it is hard for you to sleep I definitily recomend this app!! Since I tried this I play it every night before I go to sleep and it always works!😴😴👍👏",
            "Ok I love the first song and a few others but a HUGE issue is that every song just suddenly stops if it's on constant play back. Its a hard sudden stop and jars me awake before starting over. If developers can please make it a seamless loop with no stops, this app would be a 10 star and I'd share with everyone. Please consider. Also the paid for list doesn't exist on this app. No daily tips, etc. What's going on? One more: chirping birds definitely are a waking thing not a sleeping thing.",
            "Best sleep music app I've ever used! The best collection of binaural beats ambient sleep music. This app will help people with insomnia.. the 1st track is very hypnotic and you'll fall asleep fast. My complaint is there's sometimes some glitches like when you open the app again for the 2nd and 3rd time, it keeps defaulting to the last song you played the first time you opened the app.. a minor bug. Would be great if you had music controls on the lockscreen widget like a music player too. A+ app.",
            "I love the app bit ever since the upgrade was done it hasn't worked right. I purchased the timer and ever since the upgrade I have had to uninstall it and reinstall it twice just to get the timer that I purchased to work. It keeps telling me to purchase the upgrade to use the timer when I have already purchased it. If it wasn't gor this problem I would give it 5 stars because I have fallen asleep faster and easier since I started using this app.",
            "Worst app. First \"soothing\" sound that greeted my ears was this screeching followed by some kind of haunting tune. When i finally got it to switch to something else... I was blasted by what i can only imagine what several flocks of different kinds of birds all in the same place during Mating season. Just a cacophony of sounds.. Not soothing or pleasant by any stretch of the imagination."

They're probably just a bunch of tracks the developer found online, nothing original. Still, you may like it, so it's worth a try.",

            "Downloaded it Friday night n I'm already in love with the app n it works n plus it's free with no ads n no IAP n it has more sounds then most sleep apps I fell asleep in 10 mins 🤍 btw it's starting to not play any sounds without having to wait a while so that needs to be fixed so I won't have to take any stars off for the rate.. I'm on Android 10 so idk y it's acting this way"

Except for that, this is so relaxing, and I'm a girl who NEEDS relaxing. My brain runs...RUNS... 24/7! So, thank you. Can you tell me how to get the birds out of the picture? I really mean it....thanks.",
            "Love it. Wish it was a little less noticable when the loop starts. Other than that it's great",
            "Almost sounds more like static than. I was looking for something like my grandma's house with a tin roof. That's heaven.",
            "I cannot rave about this app as much as it deserves. I have horrible spinal cord damage and results in insomnia and or sleep interruptions. Makes me a light sleeper so the littlest thing wakes me up. Than its impossible to fall back asleep again. After installing this app and listening for a few minutes im in the most peaceful mood and asleep the fastest i think that i have ever been. Most of these sites have music or animal noises that interupt the tranquillity of water. Not this one. The option to turn those noises off is so greatly appreciated. I cannot thank you enough for giving me my peace back.",
            "very calming & relaxing atmospheric soundscape, the weather inside now matches the weather outside. Great for falling asleep....without the tornado."

            "I'm one of those people that have a lot of trouble falling asleep at night. After just a few minutes of listening to \"Rain on roof\", I was out like a light. The 'Waterfall\" didn't sound as much like an actual waterfall as it did just white noise, but that could be just me. All in all, though, I think you have done an excellent job and I will definitely be using your app on a regular basis. Definitely 2 thumbs up from me."

            "I guess u need to pay to have your snoring recorded after 7 days Update: ohh well, sometime it didnt analyse till 1week or 2 later not so sure why.. Also rather inaccurate. If ive never mistaken, the red line on graph refering to possible detected snoring.. When i listened to the recorded, sometime its obvious snoring, no red line. Sometime tremendous ridiculous red lines, no snoring can be heard (even when max volume!) when i spoke it detect snoring i wonder why.. This is not accurate at all!",
            "Tried to use this app. It recorded and had the hours but thats it. It Didnt give any information except the hours. It kept saying a report was being generated but hours later. Nothing. Its pretty useless if it doesn't give you any information. I just checked back and 1 sleep study showed up with a recording. But when i listen and watch the graph it is silent where it shows spikes on the graph and i can clearly hear my snoring when the graph is showing below 20.. Doesnt make sense?",
            "I didn't realise the payments were coming out of my account once a month or fortnight. I thought it was one-off price. If I uninstall will the payments stop? Also, it's no good because my dog and cat sleep on my bed and putting them in another room would mean they'd meow and bark and scratch at the door and keep me awake! So I was to uninstall but to make sure the payments will stop. Google*Hj Henriksson",
            "v2.5.2 There should be a big sign that app is in alpha or maximum beta version. Doesn't really work, tried 2 nights in a row and it could not send the reports for any analysis. Support said it was 1 time server issue and will be fixed in next version. But the problem happened 2 times. And you cannot analyse file more than once. I also tried export and import but it could not even import exported file if it has different name than data.zip. #harcoding was cool in 90's",
            "Goodsomnia Lab is a great tool to monitor your nightly snoring. It's structured professionally and has plenty of options to help you control your snoring. The nightly recordings are clear, and it's easy to understand what time or how loud your night was. I note what I eat for dinner, then check the next morning to compare how different meals affect me."

Now, as adults, we often find ourselves in need of a soothing bedtime lullaby for our own little ones, but sometimes the name or even the lyrics elude us.\r\n\r\nNo matter where on the planet or in what year you were born, your mother sang you a lullaby before putting you to sleep. Lullabies have existed throughout human history and some of the ones we sing to this day are hundreds of years old. Although no one is certain, it is believed that the name “lullabies” comes from the “lull”-ing and “by”-ing sounds one makes to help a baby fall asleep. Others believe the term comes from a Hebrew phrase, “Lilith-Abi” meaning “Lilith begone.” Lilith is a folkloric character who was believed to steal children in the night and these incantations were sounded to keep her away.\r\nHere are some popular lullabies and their origins.\r\n\r\nBrahms’ Lullaby (lullaby music, bedtime sounds, sounds to relax and sounds to sleep)\r\nOriginally titled “Weigenlied”, this song is the most popular tune you’ll find in baby mobiles or hear when a cartoon character gets knocked on the head. The tune was originally written for Bertha Faber, a young mother from Germany who wanted a new song to sing to her first newborn child.\r\n\r\nRock-a-bye Baby (bedtime meditation)\r\nBough breaks and cradles plunging from trees seem a little scary to sing about to a child, but it’s still one of the most famous lullabies around the world. There are a few different theories about the origin of this song. One is that it was written by English immigrants to America upon seeing Native American women rocking their babies in birch-bark cradles suspended from tree branches. Another theory is that it was written in the late 1700s about a family that lived in a tree and their children slept in hollowed out boughs. Regardless of its origins the words first appeared in Mother Goose’s Melody in 1765.\r\n\r\nGood Night (Lullaby music for babies)\r\n\r\nA more modern lullaby, “Good Night” b",

Now, as adults, we often find ourselves in need of a soothing bedtime lullaby for our own little ones, but sometimes the name or even the lyrics elude us.<br><br>No matter where on the planet or in what year you were born, your mother sang you a lullaby before putting you to sleep. Lullabies have existed throughout human history and some of the ones we sing to this day are hundreds of years old. Although no one is certain, it is believed that the name “lullabies” comes from the “lull”-ing and “by”-ing sounds one makes to help a baby fall asleep. Others believe the term comes from a Hebrew phrase, “Lilith-Abi” meaning “Lilith begone.” Lilith is a folkloric character who was believed to steal children in the night and these incantations were sounded to keep her away.<br>Here are some popular lullabies and their origins.<br><br>Brahms’ Lullaby (lullaby music, bedtime sounds, sounds to relax and sounds to sleep)<br>Originally titled “Weigenlied”, this song is the most popular tune you’ll find in baby mobiles or hear when a cartoon character gets knocked on the head. The tune was originally written for Bertha Faber, a young mother from Germany who wanted a new song to sing to her first newborn child.<br><br>Rock-a-bye Baby (bedtime meditation)<br>Bough breaks and cradles plunging from trees seem a little scary to sing about to a child, but it’s still one of the most famous lullabies around the world. There are a few different theories about the origin of this song. One is that it was written by English immigrants to America upon seeing Native American women rocking their babies in birch-bark cradles suspended from tree branches. Another theory is that it was written in the late 1700s about a family that lived in a tree and their children slept in hollowed out boughs. Regardless of its origins the words first appeared in Mother Goose’s Melody in 1765.<br><br>Good Night (Lullaby music for babies)<br><br>A more modern lullaby, “Good Night” b",

            "easy to use. easy timmer set. Good amount of calm relaxing melodies. not too much, not too little. average pictures. my 6 year old and my 9 year old daughter(with autism) like listening to this app. my 9 yr old actually plays it public when ever she feels anxiety/over stimulation. The melodies tend to calm or soothe her and that calms me as well so its a win win ...👍",
            "I have been using this app for the last 4 years and it is the best we could find! Both our kids dont make it to the 3rd song at night. Our kids do not want to go to bed without it! our first born was really fussy, but this app calmed her down even in the worst of times. thanx for a great app!!",
            "I think three of the songs are baby relaxing. The other that tend to change octave would possibly wake rather than lol. Also...add lyric's It allow the human connection that helps a child feel more secure.but what do I know? I'm just a lullaby grandma who always sang to my little ones.",

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least.

            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

There was an option to select cancel, but it would not respond. Then it asked me to check out more apps from the developer before I tried the app! I could not override that either. That is so irritating! Give people a chance to try it before you bombard them with requests! I am uninstalling this app!",
            "Would like the sound of storms. I have had sleep problems since I was a child. The rain is wonderful! It works on my grandchildren as well. This is a great prodoct.",

            "I like how many sounds you can play though I wish there were more good ones, there were a lot with water which I wish was not so since I have a very weak bladder that goes off whenever I hear running water but I loved the check list feature. Over all, good job 👍",
            "I love the app. But why is it glitching when the phone is locked? I've set time for duration of sound whilst trying to sleep. Otherwise I'd rate this app a 5",
            "I wish this app had more bass noises. there seem to be many high pitched sounds and high-frequency noises but I wish there were more low-frequency noises",
            "Sounded promising but app is useless when it doesn't even want to launch without crashing every time. Fix this bug for this Android user and I may try again.",

            "This app is amazing and it's free, the sounds are incredible plus u have a good selection of noises that u can mix together, yes their is a ad as soon as u turn it on but their isnt any ads while your listening for 8hrs just at the start, hey it's free they have to get paid also, so saying that, I will definitely be using this daily 💗💗💗💗",
            "Perfect for what I needed. Has the rain and water sounds, plus you can add in thunder, piano, violin, crickets, etc. You can set the timer if using to fall asleep. Only thing I don't like is it keeps playing when a phone call comes in. I have to tell the person to hang on while I try to shut it off so I can hear them. I try not to answer the phone as much as possible, so it's not a deal breaker or anything. Overall I love it.",
            "Great app, many rain sounds to choose from to fit any personality. App does not shut off at any time during the night while I run it and the ads are typically dark and the phone is able to go to sleep without the rain noises being shut off. Furthermore, the rain sounds are of exceptional quality.",
            "My favorite sleep app. Non stop rain sounds. Stays on too. I love all the different rain sounds. And additional sounds you can add. Perfect! I hate to sort through all the apps looking for these features. And with so many sound options. You have to find your sleep sweet spot. I'm so glad I did. I'm very happy!"

            "The echoing effect on some of the tracks has been fixed, but now there seems to be an issue with one of my favorites, the whale sounds. It used to flow nicely, but now it seems like it has some weird sound spasming glitch. Like a whale sound will start and then be followed by about every single sound in the lullaby in rapid succession, sometimes layering over each other. Or the diver breathing sound will be abruptly cut off by other sounds. It's very disruptive to listen to compared to before.",
            "Hit or (mostly) miss. I use this to mask tinnitus. My favorite is Car, but there are undertones and a repetitive pulsing sound that I find quite grating, almost infuriating. Once I noticed, I couldn't ignore them. So I switched to Submarine, which doesn't seem to have distracting sounds embedded. Others I somewhat like have similar distracting sounds or are to bassy. Consistent low, non-bassy sounds are what I need. I'd like to remove ones in dislike from the list altogether.",
            "The sounds are fine but it doesn't work for my phone. It might work for other people but when I enable lullabies I don't hear anything, sometimes I can get it to work but it's very glitchy and I can hear the sonar pulsing. I am on Android version 8.1 coloros 5.2.1",
            "Major bug in the app. Constant feedback through the microphone, even though the noise recording is disabled and should not be picking anything up through the mic. Renders the addon completely unusable.",
            "How to sync Spotify playlists rather than favoured albums? I used to have a Spotify playlist as my lullaby. However, since about 4~6 updates ago, i can't see it but only albums were shown in the list. Why?"

            "In principal, this is an excellent app. However, it's pretty buggy. Some sounds just drop out and disappear when they shouldn't. For instance, the Old Clock just plays for a bit and then stops, never coming back on again, even though I've selected Loop. I've created a scene with various sounds in it and it's very inconsistent. Sometimes the Cicadas and Clock will play for hours -- sometimes just seconds. Right now I've got Bonfire set to loop, but it's not making any noise. I switch to Crossfade and then back to Loop and it comes on and will play for a bit and then disappear with no logic to when it goes and it won't return until I de-loop and then loop again. Overall, the app is a neat idea, but I regret paying for it. I like the sound options better on this one, but have none of these problems with the Atmosphere app. Wish I would have paid for that one instead as reliability is more important than features.",
            "Maybe the best app for sounds. I wish you could implement the ability to save sounds you type in the cearch box and add them to their categories. That would give it that 5 star quailty. Other than that, i enjoy it very much, love the scenes menu.",
            "Very solid. There are a large selection of sounds, some really nice premium sounds you can buy, and even the option to add your own recorded sounds! Then, you can change the audio levels, direction, and much more of each set noise, then save your favorite presets. Very handy for having easy access to your own custom environments! Just don't play TOO many sounds at once, or it might become buggy.",
            "I love it, in contrast I was hoping to hear bees, I love bees an exchange or addition city sound, city is very stressfully bees are not, but you can't please everyone right? Overall is a wonderful app."

            "Sounds very natural and the timer is perfect! The pictures of the nature scenes are nice to look at while I'll awake and want to mentally get away versus me watching them at night when I'm trying to close my eyes and fall asleep. Highly recommend 💆🏾‍♀️😴",
            "I would rate this app 5 stars if there was a way to turn off the bright screen while the app is open. The wind sounds and other sounds are wonderful...very relaxing and pleasant, and a nice variety. The screen light staying on is kind of counter-productive to falling asleep, but if I can figure out how to turn it off without exiting the app, I will change my rating to 5 stars. Overall a very good app.",
            "The improvement to add the different music/sounds over the wind was a great feature add. I had really liked the app prior but that pushed to 5 stars. I would like increased natural sound choices on a similar type app (i.e. like whale songs, creaking forrests) can you make one?",
            "Love everything except one important thing. There is no repeat button to set so it doesn't move on to another wind sound. Updated: five stars and thank you for getting back to me in a timely fashion. Thank you for my well rested nights once again. 🌟"

            "Editor's Choice??? For supposing to be a relaxing app. Every time you pick a sound, you get an add at blaring volume that is so unsettling. There are ads all over the app and you have an automatic count down timer - 15 minutes before the sound ends. This app is all about stressing you into paying. There are plenty of actual 'relaxing' apps out there. Wake up editors or are you getting paid for votes?",

You put on sleep meditation, you fall asleep, once the time is up a notification awakens you to tell you your meditation session is done. Really? Then, just as you're drifting back to sleep, the phone starts vibrating and your app is asking \"Please rate us\". FAIL!  App deleted!",

I want the reply of this feedback",

            "UPDATE: Though I appreciate the timely response, your response confirms the sound issue. It gives the option of turning the volume down. It doesn't allow you to opt out so the app still sees the the mic\\speaker in use thus not allowing another app to use them. When you try to allow another app to use the sound, the candle app pauses. Does this help explain? Also, def should consider improving the sound options for the candles. Felt very \"cheap\\cheesy\" for lack of better descriptors.",
