The forum community is almost completely unmoderated & is full of very sick, uninformed people, including teenagers, reassuring each other, compulsively seeking answers, posting many times a day begging to be aided in their compulsions. It is reckless to create space for recovery & have no enforcement of healthy habits. Carl is the only active moderator. Tools are great. Community is toxic & will make newbies sicker",

What a wonderful app they've made. I really appreciate it although i kinda had one of my first app ideas been made beforehand, it is still a perfect app for ocd specially if your location supports more functionalities..my location doesn't but I'm still using other brilliant options there.

In a virtual setting designed to put you at ease, this app complements the aid received from your specialist. It takes therapy out of the confines of a therapist‚Äôs office.\r\n\r\nWith a user-friendly interface and a simple, functional design, the app provides a platform for you to manage your OCD in an effective way. The physical features of the app, designed entirely by 14-20-year-old students, allow for a graphic and interactive experience for the users, thus creating a space to easily fight compulsions.\r\n\r\nThe app helps you learn more about OCD, providing information about the causes and types of OCD and methods to combat it. It offers features to track your compulsions, building an environment suitable to control their OCD. Controlling OCD for the long-term is done using various ways to resist and weaken compulsions.\r\n\r\n1. Scheduling your Worry Time - You can schedule specific periods of worry, which will, in the long run, reduce the time spent performing compulsions.\r\n\r\n2. Controlling your Compulsions - You can also manipulate their compulsions, including changing them (their frequency and order), postponing them (offering mild resistance), shortening/retarding them (effectively minimizing their effect on your life).\r\n\r\n3. Creating a Fear Ladder - The app also allows you to create their own Fear Ladder of triggers for each of your compulsions, and perform exposure exercises to normalize these triggers. You can perform CBT exercises on the app, which helps analyze your thought processes.\r\n\r\n4. Setting Goals for yourself - All these exercises can be planned using our Goal-Setting feature. Using this, you can set short-term, medium-term and long-term goals, thus motivating yourself to fight your anxiety.\r\n\r\n5. Connecting with your Therapist through regular Reports  - The app sends weekly progress reports to your therapist with data it collects automatically through your exercises. These reports include data regarding the effect of your compulsions on your emotions, the number of OCD attacks you suffered over the week (also relating your compulsions to the time of day), and various triggers and calming factors specific to each compulsion. The app also allows the scheduling of the OCI-R between certain intervals of time, to measure the severity of your compulsions. The report also covers data regarding anxiety levels experienced by the user during their exposure exercises as well as the status of homework assignments given to them by their therapist.\r\n\r\n6. Getting External Support - You will also be able to designate certain support members whom you trust, who will be notified when you suffer an attack or have multiple compulsions and other situations where external help is critical. This ensures that you are not alone in your journey to conquer your OCD.\r\n\r\nLiberate: My OCD Fighter is an all-in-one app that connects your compulsions, obsessions, personal goals and thoughts to your specialist-advised therapy.

They managed to put it together in a way that wasn't very stressful and made me feel at ease. Now, I didn't have it for a long time because, again, I'm not good with these things. But besides being a little complex, I think it's nice. Especially after the really bad experience I had with NOCD, it was nice to see an app that made me feel safe.",
            "This app is so incredibly useful at helping me track my compulsions and that's helped me develop plans and commitments that genuinely work... not only does the app have a remarkable UI, but the creators were so helpful for any doubt throughout the process. The app provides for almost every single scenario that you would possibly need and that inclusivity is so beneficial. I've been recommending Liberate to every single person I know who works with/has OCD. In full: thank you for this app! üíì",
            "this has been really helpful! the reminders in particular have made things way easier. the app also has this great feature that when it thinks you're in trouble (start rating worry very high) it asks if youre ok!",
            "I'm so happy I found this app. I've only had it a week and I'm already getting control of my OCD. I love the worry time feature and all the exercises. I've become more aware of my triggers and I'm slowly working through them."

Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us become more resilient.\r\n\r\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to helpful thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes.\r\n5.

Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts.

            "This app went from a concise OCD app to an unfocused all-in-one app that deals with too many topics in an unfocused fashion. The old app used to have a \"daily play\" option once you progressed through the \"levels\" that let you drop into the app for a nice summary of all the previous statements merged into one level. This doesn't seem to exist anymore. The app is clunky now. The only thing good about it is that the UI looks modern but everything else is trash.",
            "I have the full version and it's genuinely helpful for OCD, but it's also overpriced for how scarce the content is. Also, lots of misspelling errors exist in the app, which make it feel unprofessional especially when you're paying. I'd like to see the devs add around triple the content (more types of exercises and little games to help!) and correct the spelling mistakes. These are two big issues, but I would still recommend the free version to people for calming from OCD caused anxiety attacks.",
            "It's not the most helpful app ever but does kill time and in the moment helps you say nice things to yourself. Worth a shot if you dont know what to say to yourself but doesnt really help to implement those behaviors. Feels more like studying flash cards for a test before learning the material if that makes any sense.",
            "Great app! I do not focus on how fast i go through it, but work to internalize some of the advice as different way of viewing things... One of my fav sayongs is - feeling pass, change, and transform..... Would also be nice if the app included mental compulsions, such as analyzing and reassurance in the assessment... Also, could use an update on a few spelling errors.",
            "Great app! Simple and intuitive but effective. One recommendation: please enable users to proceed to the next level although time limit was exceeded. Personally I like to take time to reflect on each message instead of rushing through them. I believe many others would do the same. Do that and it'll be 5 stars!"

Its very easy to use and gives you direct straightforward questions and answers. You will never regret downloading it. I highly recommend this app to anyone who needs it. Its a very useful and helpful app tool. It'll give you a more a positive view of yourself and of your mental state. A hugh thankyou to the creators, especially for allowing it free",
            "Was diagnosed by a mental health professional before & this apps tests results were right on which, for such complicated issues, was very surprising. It's a great start for someone who is wanting to know these things",
            "I like how every area of this app is straight forward; even the questionnaire is direct and effective. There are SEVERAL DIFFERENT topics to √™xplore! The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",
            "I have shared it with friends already. It's great. Retake tests compare the results to each one. Keeps a journal. Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

I don't know who's voice that is but it's so soothing and makes me unwind instantly! Don't change a thing! Thank you to the creators of this app. It's been a God send for my healing from anxiety.",
            "I've been on a severe anxiety attack that went on for 3 days. I was considering hypnosis through a consultant but stumbled upon this app. I paid the extra $$ to move the hypno sound all the way up and to put it on loop so it can play while I'm asleep. After the 1st night of listening my anxiety attack was 70% gone. 2nd night no anxiety. I've downloaded a couple of other hypnosis apps, self esteem, fear and exercise. *UPDATE* It'd be great if I could play all of the apps i unlocked while I sleep",
            "Free yet not free. Although it said the app was free, once you try it, you discover many features are not available until you upgrade to a paid version, never mentioned on the download page. It was impossible to evaluate with so many features unusable.",
            "This had become 1 of my go-to apps at the end of the day. If you don't over expect any sudden results. I just allow it to give me at least 30 min of mindfulness. When used at night I do find I sleep better.",
            "Thankful that it doesn't ask for personal details (name, age, address etc) great job üëç wish more apps were like this. Straight to the point"

Experiencing constant doubts? Suffering from obsessive thinking? Want to expand your mind and make it more adaptive? GGRO is here to help!\r\n\r\nRELIEVING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS POSSIBLE\r\nThrow away negative thoughts. Approach positive ones. Learn to identify your inner self talk and respond quickly. Train daily and improve your wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk ‚Äì individuals‚Äô ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, ROCD and maladaptive thinking. \r\n\r\nHOW DO I MANAGE MY ROCD?\r\nThe foundations of a healthy mind are built upon flexible beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that ‚Äúmy partner has to be perfect‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have to be 100% certain about my partner‚Äú - I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my ability to deal with relationships will decrease.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our well being.\r\n\r\nHOW GG APPS WORK\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of negative and obsessive thoughts.\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to neutral, adaptive and positive thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the accessibility of the above processes.\r\n5. Provide daily mood and self esteem boost.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining healthy thinking during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and relationship OCD.\r\n\r\nTRAIN YOUR THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe longer we train making it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your mind‚Äôs flexibility, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts). Users are required to complete a random set of 'blocks' to complete the level.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, embarrassment, uncertainty, commitment anxiety, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, distrust, fear of abandonment, and more.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle of obsessive thinking.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I COMPLETED ALL THE LEVELS?\r\nThe key to using the app is learning new topics, but even more importantly - training daily. There are levels designed as \"daily training\" for you to play once you completed your base course.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\r\n\r\nOTHER APPS BY GG\r\nGG OCD Training App\r\nGG Body Image Distress & Preoccupation\r\nGG Confidence & Self esteem\r\nGood Blocks",

It makes me feel content in knowing that regardless of how I feel.. there's still some positive type of response for me to read or engage and thayd helpful.",
            "I guess it's an ok app/game. Pretty boring. All you do is swipe positive affirmations one way and negative ones the other way. There is no \"training\" or anything, no advice or tips or anything like that.",
            "I was initially embarrassed to try this app and asked myself why anyone would admit to needing this kind of thing by giving a review. But oh my goodness!! This app is wonderful. It conditions the mind to think positively and embrace resilience and that is a beautiful thing. My husband is trying it now, too, and likes it as well. It has helped me already to have a more positive outlook and improved the way I relate to others. I wouldn't have believed it without trying it. So grateful!!",
            "I've definitely seen improvement in managing my thoughts and it's really nice to see an app specifically for rocd. I'm docking a star simply because a $20 pay wall is extreme.",
            "I was unsure at first because some of the exercises *could* (potentially, in certain situations) make things more difficult, if the relationship is abusive, for instance. *HOWEVER*, assuming that the person using the app does not have an abusive partner and is aware of their own weaknesses, I have found this app to be helpful. It definitely helps with intrusive, obsessive thoughts that sometimes creep into my head for no reason. And it helps me keep my crazy under wraps, lol"

It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

Even samsung health comes with free tracker for steps etc. I need a visual to help me assess and so this app and every other Anxiety app I've tried fail as nobody does the tracker for free.",

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",

It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "I love this app but one of the main paid features does not work. I want to download my entries to send to my therapist but the report output is incorrect. The emotions don't match with the correct day, the time of the entries show only the time you downloaded the report and it doesn't include any of the recorded cognitive dysfunctions I logged. I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",
            "Thus far, I say that this app was perfectly created! So far, what I've seen is very well organized & contains helpful lessons, informational videos, a personal journal, and more! This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

            "I really really like this app, DBT saved my life -- I still have much to improve upon. Practicing DBT on a daily basis has helped me to regain control of my emotions and allows me to stay focused and determined. DBT Coach is outstanding as a stand alone app, but for me personally it provides an effective substitution for a therapist during this transtion until I am able to afford individual sessions again.",
            "For $11.99 a month the app keeps crashing when certain lessons are opened. So you're paying for an app the only some content works. It's a shame because if it worked properly it would be worth it.",
            "The app is WAY overpriced. I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills. So I have used this app for two weeks and now cannot access/use the data accurately for my appointment tomorrow. If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",
            "I see potential. Needs better design and pricing. Will continue to use it to see how far I can go with free version. Also, needs someone to refresh the writing for a general audience. The video tour doesn't seem to work on my phone. Design is not intuitive. I had to figure it out by clicking around.",

It also diagnosed me with something I have never heard of (and now wish I had written down as I have uninstalled the app already) because it was so far off of my personality indicating that I did extreme things to achieve affection and felt useless without their attentions. Very far off ;) just for fun, enjoyed, now done ;)",
            "some of the questions were worded a bit off like they didn't make a lot of sense or grammar was so far off I was unsure what they were asking. also a personal issue I kept forgetting the scale value like of 1 was most or least true so if app creators want to cater to us absent minded people and put it on each page üòè otherwise fellow absent minders right it down right, I know took me 3 times but I figured out the \"cheat\" lmao",
            "the test was okay but the instructions are covered by a big continue sign or next so I scored the questions incorrectly and had to take the test over again. they need to remove the sign that covers the instructions on the first home screen. otherwise the test was fine and the results I'm not too sure about",

Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",

It has helped me so much with my panic attacks and anxiety reducing the impacts to managing my Diabetes. I have highly recommended this app to my doctor, friends and my psychologist to help other people in my local community of regional Sydney Australia. A huge thank you to the Dare team :)",
            "I must say that it's a great app and great initiative by the team , we live in a busy world n everyone is busy with themselves , but anxiety , crisis , depression are not rare , n even our dear ones sometimes do not constantly have the time to listen to our worries n be there for us , so this is where help like this is very important , i listened 4-5 audios n I m already feeling calm , n from now on I m gonna just put this on n drive away my anxiety n fears , I think it will be possible , thanku",
            "Amazing App to help you conquer anxiety! Barry has a soothing voice and his audios are outstanding! I am so happy that I stumbled on this app. The content is extensive and super helpful. The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",

The font and colours are actually making me anxious. I'll still give it a shot, but a more minimal look would go far in improving user experience.",

            "I'm on Level 117. The game won't let me go any further. I have 1 blue square on the side of the floor but the game will not acknowledge that I am tapping the blue square. I can't build anymore because I have all my town built up. It was a nice game to play until I got stuck on Level 117. Could anyone HELP me with this Problem? I would like to keep playing. Elizabeth K. Ps. I made it through level 117 and finished the game. It was AWESOME. Thank you guys. Elizabeth K.",
            "I don't mind the ads, but it's irritating and frustrating when you sit through an ad for 30 seconds and then the game won't resume...so you have to shut down and reopen the app...then you lose your points and progress. You need to fix several of the ads...especially the One-a-Day ad...freezes EVERYTIME! I like the side game of building the town and buying things for each plot of land. Fix the issue with the freezing ads and I'll update with a higher score.",
            "Too easy. Many repeated levels. 20 minutes for only ONE energy to play the next easy level (that you've already done more than 10 times) is ridiculous. And don't get me started on the \"coming soon\" section. It never comes. If you're inviting \"perfectionists\" to your game, maybe don't repeat levels and leave us stuck with nothing to upgrade.",
            "Well not really bothered by the repetition of the games as I, personally, have the memory of a goldfish. This may be bothersome for other people and yeah after awhile they get boring. Now about the town, can y'all add like a supermarket or grocery store? I already unlocked everything and it bothers me there's a cafe but not a place to get groceries. Yes I am worried about the fictional people in my fictional town.",
            "I just played five consecutive levels that I've definitely played before earlier. The levels don't increase in difficulty at all; I just passed 200 and one was solved in 1 tap. Most take between 1-3 seconds to finish, and then ads everywhere. Paying to get rid of the ads does not make the game any more playable. Don't bother."

            "I was looking for an app where I could track macros but not calories. I end up restricting and getting too obsessive. This doesn't track macros but I couldn't care less. It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

            "The experience has been good, as soon as I got into the app, for a much lower price then many counsellors you can have no limited chat and with a fee, which I didn't use can place phone meeting half an hour each. It's nice because you can switch between counsellors if you're not feeling satisfied and there are in the counselling section some guided exercises and articles for several purposes. Note that the price differs between therapy and program, being in this way affordable for more people."

It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking.

The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time.

            "I think this app was made by someone that knows allot about the various mental health disorders. Even so, I don't like to see allot of mistakes in the text of apps, but this app has a pretty big error in the app's name. It might not be an error that shows up on Google Play Store, but it shows up in my app manager and it's annoying. I also noticed at least one spelling mistake within the app, even while only reading through the very first section, about Accute Stress Disorder (ASD).",

            "Amazing. So helpful! Really this is the best app I have on my phone. Its the best AI therapist I've ever talked to. It actually feels like it listens and responds appropriately. Woebot really helps you through things when you need help. Also, there are no ads and no in-app purchases, it's crazy awesome. I tell all my friends who I think would benefit from having this app, because I've found it very helpful. 10/10 app, thank you so much!!",
            "This app is extremely helpful. A little robot, an anonymous person, to tell my worries to. The gratitude journal is super helpful too, I can look back on what's gone well. The lessons it provides are really helpful too. Sometimes, I open the app with just the intention of checking in my mood for the tracker, and i end up spending half an hour doing a lesson! They're always super helpful and make me feel better. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
            "Came across this through work and during lock down. I have not noticed anything negative about it, performance wise. Overall it's a useful well being tool to help check in with yourself and offers some useful prompts and insights about impactful things on a person's mood. You seem to be able to converse with it when you have a spare few mins. Fairly easy to 'forget' it's A.I . you are conversing with.",
            "The AI for Woebot sometimes misses what I am saying, but overall this app gives daily lessons on helpful thought patterns and tools. While not a replacement for therapy, it provides additional tools my therapist had not included as well as reinforcement of some of the tools I was already taught. I encourage other folks to try Woebot as a supplement to their self care routines and therapy.",
            "I found the app very comforting and helpful during a stressful period. I'm familiar with CBT but it was still useful to be reminded of those skills. And although you know it's not a real person talking to you, knowing that a real person wrote the text originally is comforting, and shows that someone cares."

            "Great app for self-investigation CBT style through use of the cognitive model. In the future a thought-testing feature (socratic questioning, cognitive distortions) would be making this 'the CBT app that makes all the others redundant'. I hope you will be able to make that happen. Good luck!",
            "Great thought diary following the cbt principles. Exporting option is a great plus for sharing your records (probably to a therapist) in a spreadsheet. My only complaint: pressing the help button while having partially filled a record seems to cause your record getting lost, do you have to start over again. Maybe I missed something? But in any case, thank you dev for the great app.",
            "Great for distress relief in both times of disgrace and also in general; it's probably perfect. I love it !",
            "can't delete emotions, couldn't export data when there was 1 record, when first generating report asked for permissions then something about screen overlay, couldn't allow saving report. a lot of translation errors in russian",
            "Good functionality, but the UI definitely needs improvement."

            "Very detailed and thought out app.",
            "Honestly, I haven't even gone through reading all the texts in the information section, and I can say that I already like the app! üòä The explanations and the amount of information that is given are excellent and I think that this app could be really beneficial for anyone struggling with these problems. In the least, it could help with putting one's thoughts into perspective, which is a great aid in itself.",
            "Good resource, but it needs to also include positive moods and their effects so people don't fixate on the negative or develop the sense that things are always bad. I was peaceful sitting outside in the sunshine but had no way to log this and remind myself how to achieve peace or conjure positive memories.",
            "this app is very useful in controlling and helping negative thoughts by guiding you into logical reasoning. soon, you'll learn how to stop your own spiraling thoughts. probably saved my life a half a dozen times. :)"

        "description": "Features: \r\n‚Ä¢ Enter your own personal fear \r\n‚Ä¢ Create a fear hierarchy\r\n‚Ä¢ Complete exposure tasks while live updating your anxiety levels\r\n\r\nEffective against: \r\n‚Ä¢ Phobias (snakes, spiders, heights, flying, etc.)\r\n‚Ä¢ Social anxiety disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Post-traumatic stress disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Panic disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Generalized anxiety disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Obsessive-compulsive disorders \r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nExposure therapy is one of psychology's greatest, most effective treatment tools that have been discovered over the past few decades. A key technique in behavior therapy for anxiety, exposure therapy involves gradually exposing someone to their feared object, situation, or task without any danger in order to overcome their anxiety. This app enables people to go through exposure therapy.\r\n\r\nBefore exposure, users first create a fear hierarchy - a list of activities that induce anxiety ranked from highest to lowest. Then, they work through the activities in the fear hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-inducing activity and working their way up.\r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. \r\n\r\nDetailed Guide: \r\nMany people with phobias recognize their fear as illogical, but their mind is still afraid nonetheless. This is because the primal fear centers of our mind act subconsciously whenever it spots anything it thinks is dangerous (such as lions or snakes) in order to escape immediately. However, in today's modern society when we don't have to worry about predators eating us, our minds can often trigger false alarms to things that aren't actually dangerous. \r\n\r\nThe fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there. \r\n\r\nTo break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous. The most important principle is to make sure that the fear leaves before you do. \r\n\r\nThis app helps you break the fear. First, add what you are afraid of and then construct a list of activities that will induce various levels of anxiety. Then, you can start exposing yourself by doing these activities starting from what gives you the least amount of anxiety. During the exposure process, you can track your anxiety levels by updating it continuously, and finish when it falls to 20/100 or lower. As you work your away through the activities, your fear should continue to fall! \r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. If you leave the activity before your anxiety falls, then this will actually reinforce your fear instead of lowering it. Try starting with the easiest activity first. Going straight to a challenging task might actually increase your fear. It is very difficult to stay in a situation when your entire body is screaming at you to leave, especially if there is no person there coaxing you to stay and wait.",

Rise Up offers a very helpful solution where you can log your meals manually and with no expectations. I think this helps me feel accountable to myself. Just taking this small action gives me some hope for improving my situation. As well as this feature are many journalling tasks which I've found a good way to focus my mind on non ED patterns. The app does not have a polished feel yet, and the motivational pictures after I log a meal seem rather generic. These are the only slight negatives.",

            "Honestly, I haven't even gone through reading all the texts in the information section, and I can say that I already like the app! üòä The explanations and the amount of information that is given are excellent and I think that this app could be really beneficial for anyone struggling with these problems. In the least, it could help with putting one's thoughts into perspective, which is a great aid in itself.",
            "Good resource, but it needs to also include positive moods and their effects so people don't fixate on the negative or develop the sense that things are always bad. I was peaceful sitting outside in the sunshine but had no way to log this and remind myself how to achieve peace or conjure positive memories.",
            "this app is very useful in controlling and helping negative thoughts by guiding you into logical reasoning. soon, you'll learn how to stop your own spiraling thoughts. probably saved my life a half a dozen times. :)"

        "description": "Features: \r\n‚Ä¢ Enter your own personal fear \r\n‚Ä¢ Create a fear hierarchy\r\n‚Ä¢ Complete exposure tasks while live updating your anxiety levels\r\n\r\nEffective against: \r\n‚Ä¢ Phobias (snakes, spiders, heights, flying, etc.)\r\n‚Ä¢ Social anxiety disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Post-traumatic stress disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Panic disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Generalized anxiety disorder\r\n‚Ä¢ Obsessive-compulsive disorders \r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nExposure therapy is one of psychology's greatest, most effective treatment tools that have been discovered over the past few decades. A key technique in behavior therapy for anxiety, exposure therapy involves gradually exposing someone to their feared object, situation, or task without any danger in order to overcome their anxiety. This app enables people to go through exposure therapy.\r\n\r\nBefore exposure, users first create a fear hierarchy - a list of activities that induce anxiety ranked from highest to lowest. Then, they work through the activities in the fear hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-inducing activity and working their way up.\r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. \r\n\r\nDetailed Guide: \r\nMany people with phobias recognize their fear as illogical, but their mind is still afraid nonetheless. This is because the primal fear centers of our mind act subconsciously whenever it spots anything it thinks is dangerous (such as lions or snakes) in order to escape immediately. However, in today's modern society when we don't have to worry about predators eating us, our minds can often trigger false alarms to things that aren't actually dangerous. \r\n\r\nThe fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there. \r\n\r\nTo break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous. The most important principle is to make sure that the fear leaves before you do. \r\n\r\nThis app helps you break the fear. First, add what you are afraid of and then construct a list of activities that will induce various levels of anxiety. Then, you can start exposing yourself by doing these activities starting from what gives you the least amount of anxiety. During the exposure process, you can track your anxiety levels by updating it continuously, and finish when it falls to 20/100 or lower. As you work your away through the activities, your fear should continue to fall! \r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. If you leave the activity before your anxiety falls, then this will actually reinforce your fear instead of lowering it. Try starting with the easiest activity first. Going straight to a challenging task might actually increase your fear. It is very difficult to stay in a situation when your entire body is screaming at you to leave, especially if there is no person there coaxing you to stay and wait.",

Just taking this small action gives me some hope for improving my situation. As well as this feature are many journalling tasks which I've found a good way to focus my mind on non ED patterns. The app does not have a polished feel yet, and the motivational pictures after I log a meal seem rather generic. These are the only slight negatives.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

I'd rate much higher than 5 stars if I could. When mental health services let me down I would credit this app with literally saving my life.",
            "Sensible and practical CBT, helps you feel better about your efforts, and gives insight.",
            "I recently came across this and I find it enjoyable and helpful. I'm not sure how I feel about the points yet, but it seems like a cool idea. I like that it has tests, organized set ups for different types of diary logs. It also gives you ideas and helpful tips. It makes it easier to decide how you're feeling and gauge how strongly you're feeling it. Lots of options and articles, and more! This is pretty cool, I'll be telling people about this app."

            "I like most of the features on this app, and I love that everything is free and that they're not fronting like they're trying to help like some other apps I've used. The only issue I've run into is that when I try to post a forum, it tells me I haven't created an account even when I just logged in. Not sure if it's a problem on my end or theirs",
            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

            "A good app for very basic, grounded challenges people with simple lives might face. It's very lacking, however, when it comes to greater, more complex, interconnected challenges. At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",

            "It definitely makes an anxiety attack not as severe. I wish there was more than just breathing exercises, like maybe some progressive muscle relaxation or something like that, but the calming music is really helpful. Its helped me be able to practice breathing techniques without the app.",
            "Easy and effective. Starts right away and asks you how you're feeling to adjust accordingly.",
            "I literally JUST had a panic attack and this app got me through it soooooo well! Thank you so much for making this app and also thanks for not having ads. I know you can't die from panic attacks but it sure does feel like it, and this app did an amazing job on helping me with me breathing! I don't know what else to say! If anyone is looking for a good app to help you through your panic attacks, this is the app! Again, thanks so much for this app! You're an amazing human being for making this app",
            "I just used this app for the first time and it's absolutely fantastic! I have anxiety and am trying to work on my breathing. My son and daughter have Aspergers syndrome and I am going to suggest it for them too. Because it's so visual...I feel positive that it will work to calm them too. Thank you so much.",
            "I'd like a longer or different one. i think a few more selections make it easy to know which exercise to use for the proper moment. each attack is different at times. it started to work but the short length for me was the only downfall. i will keep it and see how it progresses."

            "I would give it 5 stars but when I went to look at the gifs in the \"smile\" section I was met with a dog flashing some cartoon teeth, it meant to look cute like \"haha look at that he has a smile on its face\" but that just spiked my anxiety even higher, make sure that the gifs you use don't have any triggering things in them, even very small stuff can trigger some people that are more sensitive. Also the mindfulness section only has 4 things to look at, it would be nice if more were added.",
            "i used clear fear for a while now and im so glad i found it because its really helping. i would give 5 stars if there wasnt this little problem that gets super annoying after while. if you log into the app the first time you answer some questions like selecting which part of the world ur from, set ur passcode and a security question and all of that stuff and i confirmed everything but if i open the app i have to answer all of the questions again, like i havent answered them. please fix that!!",
            "Good app, just two notes. When I try to type a text I cannot scrol the screen down enough to keep seeing the textbox. It disappears behind my keyboard. And I would like some excercises in it that are also in calm harm. It seems that app contains more coping strategies than just cbt and a breathing excercise it also has more interaction than clear fear. But it is a bit weird to read about harm when it is about anxiety. Another option would be to choose in the harm app what one is using it for.",
            "This was an ok app but there are only two things you can do to calm you down. A breathing activity and the same recording of a person telling you how to calm down. Other than that it's just an app to write down goals. There is also no option to record an attack after it happened and instead you must go through one of the activities and say that it helped so that you can record something. Even then it'll not show up for awhile until the week ends. There could be many improvements but its ok.",
            "I was recommended to this application by my therapist, and found the resources in this application helpful. However, I do realise that there is a bug that doesn't save your information when you close out of the application. Therefore, I would have to manually key in all my details from startup again. Other than the issue I mentioned, the application overall is great."

        "description": "Note: The content in this app were made in the light of psycom.net (a mental health platform). The whole app is intended for fun and education purposes. For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think ¬£50 for 30 minutes and ¬£100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like ¬£49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. ¬£99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for ¬£70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

            "\"The only way this app is lesser to \"\"regular\"\" therapy is the element of human touch because sometimes a handshake or pat on the back is so helpful. But the app does everything else just like a regular therapist does - you can use video or phone calls if you want more of a \"\"real\"\" feeling and if youre a little shy you can stick to texting and it works just fine\"",

It's hard for me to afford a therapist and basically as a last resort I went online to try and find some help because I felt on the verge of a relapse‚Ä¶ I got so lucky to find this app. It's still not cheap, but a lot more sensible than a regular therapist and always accessible... I'm lucky.",
            "At first I didn't realize that every one of the therapists on this app are real counselors with real credentials and they are licensed by the state - this isn't some nice support ground it's actual psychological therapy and that means it's just the most incredible value for money compared to regular therapy",

        "description": "Different Types Of Mood Disorders\r\n\r\n\r\nMood disorder has become a bit of a generic term when discussing mental health. A person with any sort of emotional or psychological difficulty ‚Äî generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias, etc. ‚Äî may be described as having a ‚Äúmood disorder‚Äù.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in reality, the term mood disorder refers to one of two specific conditions: depression or Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression is certainly well known, if not actually understood. Many people refer to feeling sad or disappointed as ‚Äúbeing depressed‚Äù. This is a factually incorrect description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression is, in part, a chronic change in one‚Äôs mood, outlook, or behavior. Normal sadness and disappointment don‚Äôt linger on for weeks at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBipolar Disorder is a swing between feeling euphoric mania, and major depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBipolar Disorder can have a severe impact on the lives of people inflicted with it, as the euphoric mania stage sometimes results in excessive, irresponsible behavior ‚Äî spending a great deal of money unwisely, for instance, or inappropriately interjecting oneself into certain situations ‚Äî while the major depressive stage can leave a person almost completely incapacitated, and sometimes leads to a suicide attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases of Bipolar Disorder, a mood stabilizing medication must be used for successful treatment to take place. Fortunately, most people with Bipolar Disorder do respond to appropriate treatment, and as long as they remain in treatment, those with Bipolar Disorder can often lead normal lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving anxiety is quite a different scenario than having Bipolar Disorder. Anxiety is, generally speaking, feeling emotionally overwhelmed and/or extremely fearful, be it most of the time, or only in certain situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person with anxiety may feel as though they aren‚Äôt in control, but an anxious person typically isn‚Äôt going to engage in public displays of irrational or unreasonable behavior like someone with Bipolar Disorder may.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the person with anxiety often fears that they don‚Äôt have control over themselves, the person with Bipolar Disorder usually has no such concerns; in fact, the person with Bipolar Disorder typically considers their behavior to be completely normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the telltale signs of anxiety is a fear of losing control over one‚Äôs behavior, or of ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù: many anxious people, in fact, have a deep fear of becoming mentally ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, this fear of becoming mentally ill is typically an indication that one is not mentally ill at all, as most people who are truly mentally ill consider themselves to be normal and healthy, and may even react hostilely to anyone suggesting otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile using the term mood disorder when one really means anxiety may just be a case of semantics, it is important to differentiate between various emotional and psychological conditions, if for no other reason than to ensure proper treatment.",

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

        "description": "Feel better about your appearance. Perspectives is a cognitive behavioral therapy app for body image concerns, which is currently being tested as part of an ongoing research study at Massachusetts General Hospital.\r\nWHY PERSPECTIVES?\r\n-\tGet a personalized 12-week program to help you feel better about your appearance\r\n-\tSimple exercises based on evidence-backed cognitive behavioral therapy\r\n-\tComplete exercises from the comfort of your own home\r\n-\tGet paired to a coach to answer your questions\r\n-\tNo cost associated with the treatment \r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT PREVIOUS USERS HAVE SAID\r\n\r\n ‚ÄúI feel so much more in the moment, I walk around and notice how pretty things are‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThe [self-esteem module] was a powerful module, the tables turned at that moment, permanently‚Äù\r\n\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI would not have thought that an app could get me out of the house!‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am increasingly happy and would highly recommend the app. I‚Äôve experienced real progress as it forces you out of your comfort zone, provides structure to be able to do so, and gives me tools to be able to handle the situation.‚Äù\r\n\r\n\r\n---WHAT IS BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER?---\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are suffering from Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), please know that you are not alone. In fact, recent studies suggest that BDD is relatively common and affects close to 2% of the population.\r\nBDD, also known as body dysmorphia, is a mental disorder characterized by a severe preoccupation with a perceived defect in one‚Äôs appearance. Any body part can be the focus of concern. The most common areas of concern involve the face (e.g., nose, eyes, and chin), hair, and skin. Individuals with BDD often spend hours a day worrying about their appearance. Body dysmorphic disorder is NOT vanity. It is a serious and often debilitating condition. \r\n\r\n---WHAT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY?---\r\n\r\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for BDD is a skills-based treatment. It helps individuals to evaluate their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and develop strategies to think and act in healthier ways.\r\nIn a nutshell, CBT helps you identify negative thoughts, and recognize how these thoughts are affecting behavior - so you can take practical steps to change what you do and how you feel.\r\nResearch has shown that CBT is a very effective treatment for body dysmorphic disorder. We are currently testing a smartphone-based CBT treatment for BDD. In our experience at our specialty BDD clinic, many people who need treatment for BDD are unable to access it, because of their location, lack of available therapists, or the costs of treatment. We hope that developing and testing this CBT for BDD app will give many more people access to treatment. \r\n---HOW DOES PERSPECTIVES WORK?---\r\nPerspectives is based on evidence-based treatment, CBT. It provides simple exercises over the course of a personalized twelve-week program which you can do from the comfort of your own home.\r\n\r\n--- WHO IS BEHIND PERSPECTIVES ---\r\nPerspectives has been created by clinicians at Massachusetts General Hospital, who have years of experience in cognitive behavioral therapy. \r\n\r\n---HOW TO GET AN ACTIVATION CODE---\r\n\r\nYou can express your interest on our website https://perspectives.health/. You‚Äôll speak to a clinician and if the app is a good fit for you, they will provide you with a code. \r\n\r\n---SUPPORT CONTACT---\r\nWe care about your privacy, please read the following information carefully.\r\n\r\nPATIENTS\r\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or technical difficulties, please contact the healthcare professional who provided you with the activation code for this mobile therapy.\r\n\r\nHEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS\r\nFor support with any aspect of Perspectives, please contact Support Services via email support@perspectives.health.

Perspectives is a cognitive behavioral therapy app for body image concerns, which is currently being tested as part of an ongoing research study at Massachusetts General Hospital.<br>WHY PERSPECTIVES?<br>-\tGet a personalized 12-week program to help you feel better about your appearance<br>-\tSimple exercises based on evidence-backed cognitive behavioral therapy<br>-\tComplete exercises from the comfort of your own home<br>-\tGet paired to a coach to answer your questions<br>-\tNo cost associated with the treatment <br><br><br>WHAT PREVIOUS USERS HAVE SAID<br><br> ‚ÄúI feel so much more in the moment, I walk around and notice how pretty things are‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThe [self-esteem module] was a powerful module, the tables turned at that moment, permanently‚Äù<br><br><br>‚ÄúI would not have thought that an app could get me out of the house!‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI am increasingly happy and would highly recommend the app. I‚Äôve experienced real progress as it forces you out of your comfort zone, provides structure to be able to do so, and gives me tools to be able to handle the situation.‚Äù<br><br><br>---WHAT IS BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER?---<br><br><br>If you are suffering from Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), please know that you are not alone. In fact, recent studies suggest that BDD is relatively common and affects close to 2% of the population.<br>BDD, also known as body dysmorphia, is a mental disorder characterized by a severe preoccupation with a perceived defect in one‚Äôs appearance. Any body part can be the focus of concern. The most common areas of concern involve the face (e.g., nose, eyes, and chin), hair, and skin. Individuals with BDD often spend hours a day worrying about their appearance. Body dysmorphic disorder is NOT vanity. It is a serious and often debilitating condition. <br><br>---WHAT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY?---<br><br>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for BDD is a skills-based treatment. It helps individuals to evaluate their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and develop strategies to think and act in healthier ways.<br>In a nutshell, CBT helps you identify negative thoughts, and recognize how these thoughts are affecting behavior - so you can take practical steps to change what you do and how you feel.<br>Research has shown that CBT is a very effective treatment for body dysmorphic disorder. We are currently testing a smartphone-based CBT treatment for BDD. In our experience at our specialty BDD clinic, many people who need treatment for BDD are unable to access it, because of their location, lack of available therapists, or the costs of treatment. We hope that developing and testing this CBT for BDD app will give many more people access to treatment. <br>---HOW DOES PERSPECTIVES WORK?---<br>Perspectives is based on evidence-based treatment, CBT. It provides simple exercises over the course of a personalized twelve-week program which you can do from the comfort of your own home.<br><br>--- WHO IS BEHIND PERSPECTIVES ---<br>Perspectives has been created by clinicians at Massachusetts General Hospital, who have years of experience in cognitive behavioral therapy. <br><br>---HOW TO GET AN ACTIVATION CODE---<br><br>You can express your interest on our website https://perspectives.health/. You‚Äôll speak to a clinician and if the app is a good fit for you, they will provide you with a code. <br><br>---SUPPORT CONTACT---<br>We care about your privacy, please read the following information carefully.<br><br>PATIENTS<br>If you have any questions, concerns, or technical difficulties, please contact the healthcare professional who provided you with the activation code for this mobile therapy.<br><br>HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS<br>For support with any aspect of Perspectives, please contact Support Services via email support@perspectives.health.

All this combines with a colorful, almost whimsical user interface that is simultaneously easy to navigate and visually appealing and calming.",

        "description": "How to Overcome Anxiety is an application that helps you to overcome disruptions in your life Anxiety is a condition that usually arises with excess stress and worry. It is usually the feared possibility of the consequences of an action that brings about anxiety. The people who get anxious are always worrying about the bad things that might happen and thus create an environment of fear in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nin this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nDealing with depression\r\nFight Depression Naturally\r\nhow to deal with depression\r\nhow to overcome depression\r\nhow to deal with stress\r\nhow to deal with anger\r\nhow to deal with anxiety\r\ndealing with anxiety\r\nhow to deal with a breakup\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about How to Overcome Anxiety \r\n\r\nIf you want to know how to overcome anxiety, you must be quick to notice what wrong with you and what you need to do to correct it.\r\n\r\nIt is wise you quickly learn how to overcome anxiety now otherwise you will continue to feel stressed, unhappy and anxious throughout your life. You will suffer unduly because anxiety will weaken you mentally, sap your energy and you will not be at your best. Anxiety comes in many forms. Some suffer from panic disorder where there are unpredictable attacks of panic on the person, with its physiological consequences, while some others feel helpless in an embarrassing situation and this is agoraphobia. There are also others suffering from various other phobias like fear of heights, insects and water. Some feel that they are always watched by others, and thus suffer from social anxiety disorder. People who have undergone some traumatic event in their past suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Some people perform repeated and ritualistic behaviors to rid themselves of obsessive compulsive disorders and the most common form of anxiety is generalized anxiety disorder. These people are usually over anxious of a situation and may end up in some major depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, anxiety comes in many forms, and the first step to be taken in the treatment of anxiety lies in finding out what the cause is. Once the reason of the anxiety has been found out, it proves to be rather easy to cure anxiety. It is best to avoid these situations as much as possible in the beginning of your treatment so that there is no feeling of anxiety at all.\r\n\r\nIt may be needed to approach a psychiatrist to help in the treatment of anxiety. Under their guidance, you learn to handle anxiety attacks in three steps; before, during and after the anxiety attack.\r\n\r\nA person who suffers from anxiety should not set self-defeating goals. It is instead better to set productive and possible goals that improve one's thought and action. With this step, the patient learns to gain better control over oneself and thus overcome anxiety. When suffering from a bout of anxiety, it is better to calm oneself naturally rather than trying to fight or control one's anxious feelings.\r\n\r\nSomeone with anxiety should work at producing positive thoughts in the mind. Once pessimistic or unpleasant thoughts enter the mind, it is better to divert oneself and think of other situations with vivid, optimistic pictures. If possible, it proves to be better to think positive thought of these pessimistic thoughts, using objective words.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!",
            "10/29/20 App loaded easily & fast on my Galaxy Note 8. Set up was simple & my PCP staff was extremely helpful with walking me tthru it. Video pic very easy to see MD & clear/sound voice to hear. Since chemo this way of communicating with my PCP has been a Godsend! Not only due to weakness but to avoid contact with others, Covid 19, arrangements for travel & more. TY to whomever designed this programüëçüèªKUDOS TO YOU‚ùó",
            "The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.",
            "The doctors are very nice attentive and make sure they are very thorough. They also make sure you are comfortable with them and they make u feel like they care not saying that they don't but it's nice the way u r not rushed bc of another patient due to the office being backed up... visual visits are the best and they coordinate with your other doctors as well for the best treatment plan!!!! Great application and doctors!!!",
            "It took a little longer than I had hoped. The provider I chose never arrived. After waiting about 20 minutes, I was asked if I would like to change providers and I did and was connected in about 5 minutes. She was very kind and helpful and I will definitely keep her name for future visits!"

            "Let me talk about my feelings about playing this game. When I first saw playing ball games together, I felt that it should be more in line with my appetite. When I opened it, I felt \"It really didn't disappoint me\". This game always arouses my desire. The interest in \"puzzle solving\" is very good in terms of fun. In other aspects, such as music, they are doing well.",
            "This game is truly fun. I have been playing for about 3 weeks now. As I was noticing that the game became a bit tedious after a while, I decided to make it more challenging for myself. I sort by my favorite colors. Only placing my 1st favorite in the 1st tube in the lower left then my next favorite into the next, and so on. I‚Äôm on Level 722 and have no plans on stopping!",
            "The game is a casual puzzle game. The difficulty of the game levels is distributed in a curve, so some of the levels are less difficult, but the screen can be more beautified. The balls and bottles always seem to reveal a sense of cheapness.",
            "Generally speaking, it is a good game to play ball and ball together. The gameplay is quite good. I have just played 50 levels. The BGM of the game is not bad. The style is not too delicate, and it feels a bit rough.",
            "I really like it. It‚Äôs a bit of a test of mental logic, and the music and gameplay are also very novel. I think I‚Äôm pretty stupid. Just try a few times. It doesn‚Äôt hurt the enthusiasm of the game at all. Recommend"

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best üòÄ",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

It can be considered a puzzle game about creating intricate looping patterns or just the application of using a simple concept: \"connecting multiple things\" and make fun out of it.\r\n\r\nSome people say this game is a good puzzle game but with a great zen mode. The goal is to clear your mind, remove the stress from your daily life without any pressure or tension to solve the levels. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a stress relief or a relaxing game type, enjoy the loop!\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\nHow to Play Infinity Loop?\r\n\r\nConnect all the lines and corners to make perfect connections. It is like killing chaos and reaching perfection. Watch the video to overview how it works. Check on youtube as well where several people post the solutions. Nonetheless, we suggest you to try to find yourself how the game works and what are you supposed to do.\r\n\r\nHow to Play the Infinity Dark Mode?\r\n\r\nThe goal of the dark mode is to make disconnections, breaking it all and not leaving a single piece connected.\r\n\r\nHow many levels the game has?\r\n\r\nInfinite.\r\n\r\nHow can I save my game progress?\r\n\r\nMake sure you connect the app with Google Play Games on the settings panel (the button is in the bottom of the gameplay). This way your progress won't be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.\r\n\r\nDo I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?\r\n\r\nNo. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. \r\n\r\nI don't feel the game is challenging. Why?\r\n\r\nThe challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now. \r\n\r\nNote: This game is also available on Android Wear and Android Watches. And it's very fun as well!",

This way your progress won&#39;t be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.<br><br><b>Do I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?</b><br><br>No. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. <br><br><b>I don&#39;t feel the game is challenging. Why?</b><br><br>The challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now. <br><br>Note: This game is also available on Android Wear and Android Watches. And it&#39;s very fun as well!",

This, however, was conpletely ruined by specific ads. I'm all for free games having ads, but if you are marketing a chill relaxing game with good music, maybe blacklist certain ads. It's fine to have popups or quiet videos, but if i'm trying to relax and out of nowhere it goes \"AUDIBLE\" at the top of their lungs, its very jarring.",
            "Played it years ago as a way to kill time, reinstalled again recently. Still as good as I remembered it. Not much changed: it's still the same straightforward puzzle game. It has its challenging moments which get rid of the occasional tedium, but overall is fun. I think a good casual way to enjoy it is to finish five to ten sets a day.",
            "Great game! 3 stars because of the ads. Way too many ads. You're in the vibe with the music and all, then an ad kicks in. Come on! I understand you gotta make some money, but the ads kinda kill the mood. How about making a paid version without ads? This is a game I'd pay for.",

I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard üí™.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "The game is great. My problem is that I had a glitch where I couldn't complete a game.I matched everything but no win. I sent a message and told them and mentioned that I lost 300 coins playing this game 3 times. They fixed it, but I guess they don't reimburse for their glitches. 2nd thing, now they have a survey going. 200 coins. I could use it. Takes 15 minutes. It finally says thanks you you now have the 200 coins. Well I didn't get it. Tried again. No coins. Asked for help twice. Nada",
            "Love this game, however since yesterday on every game I play, once I've cleared the board completely I have to use one of my help options to end the round. Not sure if this is a glitch or what. I hope this gets fixed, or I will need to stop playing and delete. I am updating my review, the previous has been fixed and now my game back to working as normal. I really appreciate the fast turnaround on this. Other than that, this game is fun, and relaxing... love it.",
            "It is fun, some stages more challenging than others. Sometimes items get stuck and you need to use a cheat to get them quick enough not to lose your bonus. Only thing is, there's a piggy bank that's full that you can't use for anything but you can unlock a bigger piggy bank but why??? There's no purpose to it??? I would love the ability to do a shared board with a friend.",
            "I like the game but like others I have issues: 1) ads which can't be muted. I don't care for the political ads, wish to mute. 2) Items on the sides being hard to grasp, agree. I started using a stylus. Easier. 3) I still have no idea what the coins are for as most things in the game cost money, not coins; I'm not sure why the amount of coins reset either, what's the point? I haven't reached the level some have mentioned where there are \"ghost\" pieces though. That'll likely change my rating.",
            "Originally I gave this game 5 stars. I have cancelled that because I now only get times in the 5 minute range. Gets very boring now. Same time continually. What happened? Also agree about too many adds. Not enough time given to actually playing the game. More time spent waiting for ads to go by. I never watch them. Fixed the 'same time' problem. Deleted game for a while. Then downloaded it again. Did this a couple of times until the times changed. OK for now anyway. Problem Ads the same."

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

People have the right to be angry, happy, sad and all those behaviors. Although, when one experiences the disease, it will be most unlikely that the person will show a condition that had become tragically habitual. Typically, there are four episodes that a person will engage into if he or she suffers from the disorder. These episodes are:\r\n\r\n1. Major Depressive Episode\r\n\r\nSomeone who is experiencing a major depressive episode in his or her life expresses symptoms like:\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ persistent emotional feelings of anxiety, anger, sadness, guilt, isolation and hopelessness ‚Ä¢ indifference, apathy or self-loathing ‚Ä¢ appetite and sleep disturbances ‚Ä¢ fatigue and extreme restlessness ‚Ä¢ unable to become interested in usually enjoyable activities ‚Ä¢ depersonalization and extreme loneliness ‚Ä¢ lack of interest in having sexual activities ‚Ä¢ social anxiety and shyness ‚Ä¢ chronic pain that usually triggers irritability ‚Ä¢ suicidal tendencies or morbid thinking\r\n\r\nIn worst case scenarios, most especially if the person suffering from the disorder never had the opportunity to go into psychological help, he can become psychotic which is also known as a severe condition of the disease.\r\n\r\n2. Manic Episode\r\n\r\nMajor characteristics of people who experiences manic episodes are those that have a distinct condition of expansive, irritable or elevated mood state. Someone who suffers manic episodes experience a common insurmountable amount of energy but lacks the capability to get proper sleep.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the speech of the person is pressured in a way that even thoughts are racing. Attention span is decreased and can be easily distracted. Impairment of judgment can also be experienced whereas the sufferer will undergo sprees and abnormal behavior that is quite unusual on his or her part.\r\n\r\nIndulging in substance abuse can also be possible. Substances may include depressant drugs, stimulants, and even sleeping pills. Behavior may range from being intrusive or aggressive. Grandiose and delusional ideas may become prominent. During extremes, a person may exhibit psychosis which is a factor that perceives fantasy more than reality.\r\n\r\n3. Hypomanic Episode\r\n\r\nThis is the lesser part of mania episode. Extremes are less prominent. Symptoms and attitudes are also decreased. When a person experiences a hypomanic episode, he would feel sudden uncontrollable behavior like laughing out loud even with no specific reason behind it or there might be a reason but it would be shallow.\r\n\r\nDuration of the episode occurs only for a short period of time.

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

        "description": "Anxiety symptoms can last for a long time, or come and go.\r\n\r\nEach anxiety disorder has unique symptoms. Anxiety disorders are typically diagnosed when fear of non-threatening situations, places, events, or objects becomes extreme and uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nAn anxiety disorder may also be diagnosed if you have general feelings of fear or worry that interfere with your daily life and have lasted at least six months.\r\n\r\nMost people with an anxiety disorder have a combination of physical and psychological symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere is one symptom that all anxiety disorders have in common: near-constant fear or worry about things that may happen to you now or in the future. Read on to learn what the symptoms are and how to diagnose anxiety disorders.\r\n\r\nSome studies suggest that experiencing anxiety could increase the risk of developing certain long-term physical health problems, including diabetes, stomach ulcers and heart problems. But there's not enough evidence to say for sure exactly what the risks are, or what groups of people are most likely to be affected. Having a physical illness or disability can also make you feel stressed and anxious, so it might sometimes feel like your anxiety problems and physical health problems are part of a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nSometimes it might be difficult to work out whether your symptoms are totally related to anxiety, or might be related to a different illness. If you're experiencing any physical symptoms it's best to talk to your GP, so they can check out what may be causing them.\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Anxiety or Panic Attacks?\r\nWhat we think of as anxiety attacks are actually panic attacks. A panic attack is the sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort that peaks after about ten minutes, and it typically lasts no longer than 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nResearchers think that panic attacks come about because the brain is telling the body that the fight-or-flight response, which includes a rapid heartbeat and shallow breathing, should kick in, even though there may be no threat at all. Scientists also theorize that the amygdala, which is the brain's fear processing hub, may also be activated during a panic attack.\r\n\r\nPanic attacks may come on because of a particular event, or they may come on for no reason at all. It's been estimated that almost 23 percent of people will have at least one panic attack in their lifetime.\r\n\r\nIf your panic attacks are recurring, you are likely to be diagnosed with panic disorder. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder thats characterized by persistent worry about future panic attacks or their consequences.",

            "This game is awful. So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this pleaseüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse üòë we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please üôè fix your game üòî"

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

For Sigmund Freud's well-known definition of mental health as the ability to love, to work, and to play, remains absolutely valid.\r\n\r\nThe ability to love refers to the possibility of establishing authentic and intimate relationships with other people where you can give and receive affection without excessive fear.

The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",

I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

            "I love this app because it keeps my mind busy. It is a learning app, which a lot of the things in this app is more than I can understand. Because I think I get the right answer and I don't because it shows me the answer to I believe.",
            "I really enjoy this app! There are a few grammatical errors, but I don't understand why that is a problem for some,it's the message/information that counts,it's still readable,& surely that's the main thing. Excellent information,IMHO,so 5 stars from me. Only minor issue so far,is sometimes if I wish to share,there's a pop-up reading \"Error-Fill\"? But it doesn't hinder me from sharing,so it's not really a \"problem\" per s√®. Thank you so much Dhanesha,~please keep it upüëçüèºüòäüëçüèª,Miss D",
            "Accurate for the most part, but definitely some questionable 'facts'. A lot of them also seem to contradict themselves. A few repetitions but I was expecting that. The grammar really isn't as bad as some of the other reviews say, it's not illegible or anything, just a little off in the sentence structures. I found it perfectly easy to understand. Overall, good to learn some new information, but if you don't already know a bit of psychology you might not be able to tell which facts aren't true.",
            "I was not expecting much from this app. I was not expecting every fact to be repeated 3x in each section. While they may have been interesting the first time I read one... not so much the 2nd time, & the 3rd time was a complete disappointment. It should read: \"Eleven New Facts Repeated Three Times.\" Granted I stopped reading after the second section was just like the first.",
            "it's basically a good app. you have to think for yourself and be aware of ANYTHING that you read, not accepting another person's written word just because it's there. errors and typos shouldn't be an issue if you are a self thinker. the original is probably in a language other than english and when translated (by a translation app) word for word some things will be lost or skewed in the translation. all of this should be considered in our review. so I give it a 3."

            "You say there are still future plans that a new season with new content will be released gradually. And you want the players to be patient. I would say its too late for that since many have now decided to uninstall this game, since your last announcement. Promises of future content isn't what makes a great game. The lack of providing a fresh new gaming experience to the players is what brings a game crashing down. I too have decided to uninstall Disorder since your last announcement.",
            "The reason why I put 4 stars is because when I first downloaded the game, I thought it was impossible to win but all you need is strategy. Another reason is because when ever I am matching, it would take a lot of time to let me in a group. Other than that, the graphics and the gameplay is the one of the BEST. I highly recommend this game. Like LEGIT.",
            "This game has been in Season 0 for months now since it's launch, there has been no updates and no changes what so ever, you guys really gotta focus on updating your games more cuz it gets really boring when theres nothing new, I've enjoyed the game when it was just launched but now since there's nothing new it just got really boring.",
            "This is a cool game, indeed. But a while ago, my friend got trashtalked for a stupid reason. Her teammates camped in opponents base while my friend just played the game normally than they did. What's the use of base battle if their just gonna kill the opponent and not capture the base, right?! I hope that the players are playing fair. And also she's lagging even though her connections fine!!! That's why she deleted the game. I don't think she'll play this anymore. Full of foul players!",
            "The game mechanics are great the characters and skills aswell but thiers 2 things I dont like about the game 1. is that the servers right now aren't that good u can be waiting for a match to start 5mins or more that is if ur lucky, I've been playing solo this whole time for that reason. 2. When I first download this game I thought oh this is going to be a Battle royale since I'm into last man standing but it's more like capture the flag and pretty much ur efforts are worthless so for now byeüëã"

            "Editing my review after messing around with it. It's still just alright. I wish I could do multiple songs at once however. And if I have one album but different artists, I have to use one album art overall (at least in my music player anyway). But if I change those album names the album art is correct. Edit: Now no longer works as intended. Art is changed in the app but my music player doesn't update it accordingly.",
            "One of the best Album art changers on playstore. But, off lately it is doing nothing. When I open the app, the advertisement loads at the start ü§£ but the songs list doesn't appear at all even after waiting for a long. üòµ. Hence the main objective of changing the album art is never fulfilled. Very disappointing.",
            "The app is excellent as a song tag editor but the biggest flaw it has is that it shows vulgar dating apps advertisements and it annoys me a lot. Edit: Now it shows some quality ads like of Google pay and Audible Audiobooks. But to be honest I don't like ads.",
            "Does what it says. Really impressed with the so easy to use interface. Also it is really easy to change the album arts. Even i could find the album arts for some songs which i was unable to find and other apps that i used. Great app. Definitely deserves 5 stars.",
            "Works fine but like most apps these days greed has over come the developer causing the app non usable due to advert invasion. Literally every time you do an action on this app (touch the screen) a 30 second advert pops up. Personally I label apps like this as malware due to the invasive advert attacks. I absolutely understand developers need to make money but there is an acceptable line and this dev has way crossed it. Shame cus the coding is great"

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

However , there is some kind of bug happening right now; the app is not uploading new pictures for my entries, it replaced the selfie I took with a shot from 4 or 5 days ago. I've had the same picture log for the last 4-5 days, and that aspect is one of the reasons I love it so much. Now it seems to be useless. I've tried contacting for support via the website with no reply. Thanks!",
            "This is ALMOST perfect. I love how I can set reminders throughout the day, because I forget keep up with mood journals most of the time. Overall, I really like the setup and interface. Definitely worth the purchase. The only problem I've experienced is that sometimes, if I accidentally touch near the back or done buttons, it'll save the unfinished portion, and I can't figure out how to edit it. I'm not even sure if there is an edit feature? That's the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars",
            "Pretty good app to journal and track emotions, recommended to me by my therapist. A few suggestions: -Make good moods green and bad moods red. It doesn't make sense intuitively that an amazing mood would be bright red and an awful mood would be a positive green color. -Add option to add your own #emotions. Some of my emotions don't come up as default. -Timely reminders pop up at random times, do not follow times I had selected in app.",

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forwardüò•",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "Update 5.0 replaced most battles with \"skips\". Turn the game on, Skip 700 battles, auto-pvp for 10 times in 2 modes, turn it off. As for guild war, the same pay-to-win guild has been #1 since the game's launch. The devs really need to balance things so other people have some chance. Anyone who tries their best to get that gw win just once will be sorely disappointed and might as well go play something else. Same people are always #1 in all other modes too. It's a joke.",
            "Played this game for a couple of years. It was fun! But, I slowly saw it go from time2win to pay2win. I used to just let my phone run so I could grind the best 6 star armour. Every now and then they have specialty characters I would purchase for a couple of bucks. Nothing expensive though. But now I can't even fight bosses w/o paying for a \"skip\" token? I can't even get the option to choose valor like I did before! Welp, guess it's time to move on to another mobile game.",
            "I really enjoyed this game for several months and it was the only one of these types of games I spent money on. it has been a generous game and the one experience i had with customer service was good. The latest patch however 5.0 i think, was a disappointment. It took the fun out of it for me. Adding new features is generally a positive, but not when you overwrite other features. It made it ungrindable. I haven't really been interested to play after trying the new update.",
            "With the new update you really don't have the chance to play ,the skip system won't let you see how your heirs are doing in the dungeon because don't allow to see the fights so if you don't see the fights how you gonna chose the heir that fit you . I consider the developers need to give us the option to chose between skip and use valors. Thanks",
            "Don't bother with this game, you'll soon realize you can't keep up as a f2p player. New unit every other month that is broken so they can release the next one to control it, rinse and repeat since the beginning if the game. Now with 5.0 update they completely gutted the game of what made it unique. Add in the worst type of content in gacha: gear/rune crafting. Materials for this type of content dominate drops from gear/rune dungeons, crafted gears/runes are notoriously worse than farmed version"

SCHEDULE supports the retake of missed sessions in history now. Try and get more circles.<br>2. Another upgrade! Tap the screen to check the pose list while exercising. It&#39;s much easier to browse and switch poses now.<br>3. New Courses in November: Winter Energy Flow-Intermediate Element Yoga, Easy Morning Yoga.<br>Monthly Golden Day, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday are coming!",
        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

            "Only 3 stars because I quite enjoy the game, there are alot of ads which I can deal with however you dont get enough lives so you're basically waiting and hoping that the other player hasnt put their phone down so you can play for longer than 5 minutes. My suggestion is either add more lives, or cut down the time to wait for lives. If its going to be a half hour wait to get 1 life, it's not worth my time when I use all 3 in 5-10 minutes.",
            "This is a super great innovative game. I love it. I have always loved the paper version, but to find an app version, this is great. Thank you developers and all who worked hard to make this app possible- From the little guys who are hardly recognized to the CEO or whatever you call your top people.",
            "The game itself is fun! It would be great to have a way to leave comments to your opponent. Some people leave hilarious answers. But the ads are offensive and obnoxious. I understand the need to have ads to support the business, and that I could just pay $3 to remove them. Just beware if your kids want to download it, some of the ads are Rated R.",
            "I REALLY love this game. It's super fast paced, makes me think and I really enjoy the premise of it. However the ads are absolutely terrible. They are constant and long and I know I will soon stop playing the game because of it",
            "The game is fun but very repetitive but it's whatever. I hate how many ads there are and the amount of time they need to run before you can exit out from them."

            "I gave this game 3 stars! I love this game so much but... When I updated the game, all my dolls dissapered! I got really sad and angry. I wish I never updated the game. By the way I have some suggestions that you can add into the game: 1: When you update the game, you don't lose all yours dolls. 2: Add more outfits for the girls. 3: For the black eye color it should be darker. I love this game soo much. Thanks for making this game. I REALLY enjoy it!",
            "I love this game. It helps you be creative and choose who you want to create. People without premium get to have a challange were they get to use items that arent premium. I also love this game because it brought me closer to my friends that don't live near me and they end up installing the app. One thing i would like to add would be like hats or bows so you can have things in your hair without paying for premium. I hope this helps everyone that reads this. Thank you for making this game. üòä",
            "5/5 Stars!! I love this game so much! It's a great way to make avatars and you could even make your self and, try out different looks! There is minimal ads but, there could be a spin wheel that you can watch ads to spin and get like a daily spin to earn coins. You could then use those coins to unlock some of the locked items just for 1 or 2 uses. Mainly because some of the best items are locked and only for premium users. Other than that love this game and 10/10 recommend!!",
            "Very fun, adorable avatars, and I love the hairstyles and the fact you can layer the clothes, only one thing, this is just extra kind of feedback, maybe add a few more things, but overall it is amazing! Also it's not even that, that is the only thing I would say about improving this app! Super fun, and the fact you've included masks is another great feature, and shows your respect and seriousness towards the pandemic. Great job!",
            "This is a really great game. I personally think that you could add a new option for creating dolls (full body option) Aswell as this, you could also add some cool postitions for your doll to pose in, this way when you save your dolls they will be in a cool position and you can also see there legs aswell. Other than this, this is one of my favorite games to play. üëçüèª"

They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying.

            "To play without ads, turn off your wifi and data; That being said, I would have given it a 5 as I used to REALLY enjoy this game, but as of today I do not. For whatever reason, it now removes and rearranges the tubes once you have filled a color. I do NOT like this, it is havoc on my brain/eyesight.",
            "Great game. Loads of ads, so you'll need to pay to get rid of them. It is worth the free, however, you still have to watch ads when you get enough percentage to unlock the test tubes. Hence my lower star rating. Surely you should be able to unlock without watching adds when you've paid for no adds? Big downside!",
            "Really nicely done. You'll usually have difficult levels interspaced with a few easy ones, so every time you pick it up you find the game challenging and rewarding, great flow. The sound effects are perfect too. Given the time it often takes to complete a level I don't find the ads too obtrusive either.",
            "Too much irritating by ads, why don't you stop ads displaying on my screen. While I play this game to stop my mobile data button, is it ok for you. Try to imporve your game, I can't suggest to play this game to anyone of my friends & relatives. If in case iam going to suggest this game and they are all facing same problem like what Iam facing problem with this game. They all be√†t me very hard. Because this is too much irritating by ads playing between game to game. Can check it or not tell me."

            "Mostly docking points for the system integration (which is classic Adobe arrogance imo). If I could open images directly from the gallery (etc), it would be much more efficient. As-is I have to add it to \"All Photos\" (no other options), open the app manually, open the folder, find the image, and then I can start editing it. Also, while I like the new UI, it took me a bit to find everything. It's not visually obvious that you can swipe the toolbars for one thing.",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! - I have been using this PAID product for over a month and have experienced nothing but persistent crashes.It cant even do an export to JPG without crashing. I have sent numerous reports to Adobe, but nothing has been done. So disappointing, as the product has some good features, but is totally overshadowed by instability issues and the fact Adobe charge you monthly for the pleasure. Maybe it works OK for other platforms, but for Android its a car crash. I've cancelled my subscription and uninstalled. On the look out for a professional product that allows you to edit/save work.",
            "Needs a way to allow the theme to be changed from dark to light. Poor choice of text color for files uploading count. Needs a way to get a list of the files claimed to be uploading which never seem to finish! Always hangs on uploads. Syncing fails on a regular basis to LR Classic. Camera only uses some of the lenses on my LG V40 using Android V10.",
            "A great app I have yet to try the paid version. It does almost anything you want it to. I do have a minor complaint. I use this on my android tablet usually and I wish there were ambidextrous controls. I use my pen a lot and it's very difficult to tune the color and lighting which are all on the right side as a left handed person.",
            "I'm blown away by how much you can do with the free version. It seems a little complicated at first but the more time yo give it the more you learn and the more you realize this is probably the best free editing app available on your phone. Have so many lessons available aswell. Honestly excited about any new updates."

Until then, I can only give one star.",

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",

            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",

I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

            "I love this app. I use it to edit all my Youtube videos (See Spot Clean is the name of my channel). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen üëëeven when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a üåü from me."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping ü§£ its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day üòÇ The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more üëå",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off ü§£. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

My only issue is the price. I feel for photo editing thats not as extreme or precise as something similar to photoshop; shouldn't cost more than photoshop. But thank you for providing with an app I do find enjoyment with!",
            "I have had this app for a couple of years now. Unfortunately have had to change phones which included switching back and forth from iPhone to Android. Even though I've already paid it now won't let me use features on my new phone unless I pay again which I was going to be a sucker and do but it tells me I have the wrong password. Google says I'm using the correct pw. So looking for an alternative app. Super annoyed. Over it.",
            "I love this app! Especially the part where when you do the smooth it doesn't turn you into looking like weird deformed baby! Like a lot of other places do! I often have to do some things on here and then go to PicsArt to do others but between two apps just amazing! that maybe we could have figured out how to do the things on this one that I can do over there but other than that I highly recommend this app!",
            "I really think that this app is unique and has so many features that you literally can play with your pictures for hours on end changing every little detail and having so much fun doing it!! I went the extra mile and paid for a whole year of premium and lemme tell you, when that year is up, I will be paying for another one!! My favorite feature is the skin tone adjustment. It's really amazing and makes your skin just glow beautifully!!",
            "I really enjoyed this app. Even paid for the subscription for the year. 2 stars because after about 2 months into my 12 months it told me I had to pay for premium features again. I tried emailing but no one got back to me and I still can't use premium features. Super disappointing."

            "Well, there are hundreds of advertisements which are displayed after 2 seconds! They are quite annoying. So, I didn't give 1 star. And also, in the levels, there is a option \" Enter \" which isn't working. Everytime I tap, it displays ‚ùé. I request the producers to improve these problems. But it must be mentioned that this is an excellent game. There are tricky puzzles to play and pinch your brain and there are thousands of brain teasers. I do recommend this app to all customers. Thank you.",
            "Very fun, and entertaining!! :) You will be asked questions, they will seem almost impossible. But theres this Light Bulb you can click that gives you a hint. Sometimes you can answer. You don't always have to click the Light Bulb icon. The questions will get harder, and harder. Btw I love this app <3 Keep up the good work!!",
            "I love this game. It's interesting and good for time pass. So many people are saying in reviews that this app shows ads alot. For those people, I just want to say one thing 'Why don't you guys switch off your mobile data while playing this game?' Solution of your problem is too easy.",
            "This game is just like the rest and not that fun and you get to a question that looks like you should give you own answer, what rating would you give this game and the only one that is \"correct\" is the one that says full marks and then tries to make it seem like you wanted to pick that.... No. Just no."

Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! üòä",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "I really like the idea, the art is very nice. Everything feels natural with the controls. The one thing I DONT LIKE is that it feels like a tutorial for 29 levels and then level 30 took me by surprise. It was a fun challenge. But a steep jump in difficulty progression. Once again, a great game which deserves 5 stars, but tweaks could be made to better user experience!",
            "Would be a good game if they didn't just repeat the same puzzles over and over again, just flipping and reversing previous levels. It's dumb. Also you can't go back to previous levels you can only play the one you're on and the difficult ones come maybe once in 50 levels. Boring. And since it's a VOODOO game, you know you have to turn off your data and wifi otherwise you'll be hit with a ridiculous amount of ads... At least one after each 10 second level...",
            "Good concept, decent design, crappy execution. I think it's relaxing, and it'd be fun if the ads weren't so intrusive, it didn't constantly repeat levels, and if there was actually thought put into the puzzles. Half of the time you can't actually make any choices. You just move the ball on a track. The other half it's very random feeling. There's no ramp up in challenge. Some of the first levels are repeated much later in the game.",
            "You must work on levels. how come level 139 is as easy as level 1.. It seems its just showing up any random level and back button does not work when you are playing a level... you cannot go back to level listing. I could play this game with absolutely no mind involved. Its like drawing doodles on a blank paper. and after some time. people will just delete it out of boredome. Seems like work of someone new with game dev. well if that is the case. Keep it up. Consider players' perspective.",
            "The first time I played this game it was pretty cool good but as I played it more I realized that the levels became easier.... I hate the game now. Even though level 20 and 15 look \"hard\" their really easy so umm.... Why do people even give this five four three stars? ;-; I'm honestly disappointed well done to the people who tried and are enjoying the game. Oh and to many ads!.. the same fricking and keeps playing again (x2) So like um the ads are way to much"

            "Fun Game, Too Many Ads. Finished a level? Watch an ad. Don't want an ad? Here's one anyway. Here's another ad, I didn't skip the last one fast enough. Way too much. I timed it and for every 2 minutes of actual gameplay, I had 3 minutes 48 seconds of total ads",
            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "This game has a lot of potential but after a while it gets quite boring. Don't you think that when you have the buttons with the stripes an the arrows that if you merge them together you could clear the board or some type of explosion that adds points to your score. Come on people use your imagination we all have one. If I come up with something as simple as the explosions with the straight buttons I'm sure you could come up with something a lot better since you're supposed to be the experts",
            "I've always enjoyed this type of connect games and, to me, this is probably the best one out there. You can spin a wheel once a day for free to win bombs, scissors, ect. to help if needed. Youcan use gems to buy spins and it's very easy to get gems. There's no limit to how many times you can spin the wheel as long as you have gems which is great!Some levels are difficult but you can always get extra time if you watch a 5 to 30 second ad. Try it. It's a great game!",
            "My \"go to\" game for winding down and chilling out. Rarely do I find myself frustrated, and the ads are tolerable and, quite often, convenient! My teenager laughs at my longevity/commitment.....Level 1141 and climbing! There's just so many spots waiting to be connected!!! ...................... Side note: I usually keep my volume off while I play, but sometimes I thoroughly enjoy listening to the spots ‚òÜ \"PoP\"!‚òÜ when connected........and the fireworks! ü§£ü§≠ü§ì",
            "I don't like that you run out of gems so fast and that you only get 2 free ones when u watch an ad its just to much work to keep pressing the button and watching ads over and over again just for two gems.. I think we should get more gems and more time on the clock.",
            "Please help! When playing a game, after a few minutes, everything freezes and can't make anymore moves.... do i perhaps need to do an update or something? Love the game and don't want to start from the beginning again. All help will be appreciated Thank you."

        "description": "Here Hear focuses on narrative treatment orientation, allowing users to freely express emotions and tell stories in a completely anonymous manner, objectively recording emotional indicators for a period of time, and providing a simple self-assessment. Use music therapy, mindfulness breathing meditation and listening to stories to alleviate the symptoms of depression, so that users can feel the warmth of companionship.\r\n\r\nNarrative Therapy:\r\nNarrative therapy belongs to the postmodern treatment orientation. Monk (1997) believes that the reality of personal cognition will be influenced by the social, cultural and political context. Narrative therapy helps the client to distinguish his or her own story from a strong story and re-construct a personal life story.\r\n\r\nThe most important key to narrative treatment is to guide the parties to tell their own stories and emphasize that the story is subjective rather than objective. The story will change slowly because of the thoughts, beliefs, and experiences of the parties. Even when it is a continuous and repeated narrative, each time the feelings brought to others are different.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from a victim in the real world to a storyteller, we have the uncomfortable feeling that we are able to take ourselves out of the situation first. At the same time, the storyteller can change the inner feelings of the main character of the story at any time, and then rewrite the ending of the story.\r\n\r\nThrough the guidance of the Here Hear system, users will be able to correctly recognize their emotions and feelings in the storytelling process, cultivate the ability to empathize and listen, not arbitrarily criticize or evaluate anyone, but only responsible for their own growth, developing their personal philosophy of life from their own stories and the stories of others. The longer you use it, the more capable you will be able to rewrite the feelings and endings of the stories, resulting in the process of self-healing.\r\n \r\nMindfulness Meditation:\r\nMindfulness meditation is a self-awareness method that focuses on the present and is completely open. Mindfulness has been confirmed by many studies and has a considerable improvement in mental disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis, panic disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major traumatic syndrome and chronic pain.\r\n\r\nDue to pathological factors, the negative thinking circuit of the brain will continue to circulate, causing cases to suffer mentally. Traditionally, drug treatment and psychotherapy are used to block negative thinking and re-establish a positive thinking circuit to help patients improve their mood.\r\n\r\nMindfulness meditation is a systematic approach that can be self-trained. Long-term training of this skill can help you calm your mood, stop the brain‚Äôs forced recall of what has happened, and anxiety and fear of the future, thereby slowing down the symptoms of depression. .\r\n\r\nHere Hear provides a 10-minute mindfulness breathing guide after storytelling to help you divert your attention, feel your breathing, physical changes, exercise your mental resistance, and improve your emotional intelligence.\r\n \r\nMusic Therapy:\r\nMusic can change a person‚Äôs mood very quickly. The application principle is to reduce the heartbeat and blood pressure of the listener through a stable music rhythm, thereby relieving tension, anxiety, anger and other emotions, and can achieve the functions of relaxing body and mind, reducing pain and focusing on the present.\r\n\r\nHere Hear‚Äôs background music is adapted from Mozart‚Äôs No. 4 Violin Concerto, with beautiful melodies and a steady rhythm. We hope that users can feel calm through music without clicking any function.",

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

            "This game is really fun I have been playing it for a while and I love it. You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwUü•∞ü§©",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it and even wondered my other apps maybe interfering & causing it to crash. But then I thought \"I wonder if anyone else is having the same problem\" so I come on the play store, look at the reviews and big surprise its happening to everyone. THEY NEED TO UPDATE THEIR LAST \"UPDATE\"! VOILA.",

I have used other launcher hola launcher very similar to solo launcher for many years it was my favourite but now not existing ; better in that range one and only is the Solo launcher. But now it is crashing in REDMI NOTE 9 pro max. And Samsung also. Need to sort it out immediately. Originally I rated five Star. But continuous crashes it is down rated.",

            "I've used this only for 10min of having it downloaded first impression, it is really awesome. I would like to add one thing at the start of opening the app instead of going into YouTube have something on screen pop up that tells you how to use the control centre because trying to figure it out at the start was tricky but then I watched the video and saw that there was a transparent green line to indicate where the control centre was. Other than that you've made a beautiful app",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 years now and I love it. It mimics the IOS control center the best. However, I have encountered a lot of glitched and issues since the last update. For starters, the control cent now gets stuck halfway on my screen when I swipe left to use it. The swiping used to be very smooth, now it is choppy. Edit: I know you need ads, but your ads play in the background even when IM NOT in your app. Recent glitch that started since last update. Could you please fix it?",
            "I love/hate this app! I hate it because every time I open the app and I click one button inside the app, it will trigger an ad, ALWAYS! And it constantly want me to screen record even if I don't click the record button (also the color black in color is not there and I can't turn on the blur setting). And I love this app because it is so smooth and the music playlist works. I recommend adding more customisable buttons and more feature to this app. I'll rate 5 if you guys did this üëçüëç",
            "Best app for control center BUT AFTER THE LATEST UPDATE, THE PANEL DOESNT SLIDE AUTOMATICALLY. I have to swipe all the way to the end of my screen! Please fix this and i'll come back to use this app! update: i think it's been some time since this problem is existing....... isn't the developer fixing this issue....",
            "Everything was well and doing great until the recent update. Now, I had to swipe the control center from start to the opposite edge of the screen or else the control center will get stuck halfway. It really ruined the experience because I use it everytime. I shouldn't have click the update button. I'm uninstalling for now, I hope this gets fix soon. Edit: It only gets stuck in the midway when I half swipe (I positioned it on my lower right screen) when I'm using the live screen blur background"

Ads only happen if you want to make a bit of in-game cash. I would like to know what an upgrade will get me. \"Improved performance\" and \"more crafting options\" doesn't shed much light on what higher level buildings can do. Haven't found uranium yet.",

It's amazing how much you can do. There's always something new to explore etc. Its only downside is that the gameplay is extremely slow, but it also has its charms: it gives a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of the road. Dear developer, if you see this, just know that i love your work and can't wait to see what comes next.",

It is a difficut game to get the hang of and so a discord group has been created by the developer to assist players in progressing through the game and allowing them to socialize with other players.",

Do I need to research something fails to tell me in the game. There is no close button when you open menus in the game. Pressing on top where close button should be works. Fun game too bad it's so clunky. Five out of five if you fix the issues...",
            "It's a fun game and I like the idea but the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the UI. It jitters when you switch outposts and doesn't register half my taps, meaning you have to press the button twice for it to do something. Developers, if you're reading this, please improve the UI! Make it less jiterry and clunky and I'll up my review to 5 stars."

            "Easy to follow. Like the way it is divided into catagories so it is quite easy to find the specific phrase looked for. Learning the pronunciation was easy and quick. Thank you.",
            "The ADS, whew!! Lost a star there. Otherwise good app, the audio is great, easy to understand, unlike some that have a robotic voice that mispronounces the words. Useful phases (in formal language), I think it will be great for building phase recognition. Also really like the \"favorites\" option where you can save words/phrases to a separate tab for easy studying. Recommend being able to read Hangul. I'm curious if there's more content available with the 4.99 upgrade? Seems pricey if not.",

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",
            "Fun but the ads were annoying. I'd rather have a long ad that I can't skip than short ones every few seconds. I can't take it anymore. Uninstalling",
            "I bought the ad free version but it doesn't give you the option to sign in when downloaded to a new device and Google Play says I already own it and can't buy it again, not that I want to pay for it again.",
            "This is a really boring game. I hate it soooooooooo much and it's very annoying because you could only stick the couple a million bazillion times anyways make this game fun or exciting. Oof edited this and still it's so BORING and ANNOYING. Please upgrade it."

            "Overall it's a brilliant app but after some time I've noticed that it always opens with the photo size 19:9 which is a very annoying and random size to use. Have to redo the settings everytime I open the app which is frustrating so I'm uninstalling",
            "This app is really enjoyable, just that they should try and improve the audio quality when shooting video with music ON, other things are perfect.",
            "It's a very good and easy to use app and it doesn't contain so much ads but if you could lesser the ads it would be even more easier to use the app for the user."

Lately, when trying to locate another phone on our plan, it can only tell me the county that the phone is in - which is absolutely useless information. Other times, it can't locate the phone at all. AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

I can never find a exit sign on an add and it just goes on forever and adds run while you are playing a level, that is messed up. so adds literally destroyed the levels I was playing. I can only play it on airplane mode, but then i cannot get the upgraded canon and other things. so it is annoyingggggg. please fix it..... i gave 1 star because of that. otherwise the game is great. so sorry.",
            "The gameplay is simple & relaxing and I enjoy playing. Although it's free to play, I expect to watch ads, however, there are ads before & after each level, from 2 ads @ 5 seconds each and many 30 seconds. So if you enjoy watching ads more than playing the game, you will enjoy this game. For me, I watch less ads on YouTube than I do with this game. Thanks for a unique game, but no thanks.

            "Actually game is too much good,but in the 22 level one add was coming there is not have options to close it continuously running the game i checked almost 20 mints, i cleared catch also,plese solve and let me know, i will play game again"

            "Was a great app, but when one purchases an app outright in full, then later is asked to now pay/subscribe to use half the tools suddenly is not okay at all. I never have & never will use subscription services. If you had the option to buy a new upgraded version each year, I'd be ok with that. But to pull a \"re-pay\" stunt like that for existing customers, leads me straight to the exit on this. I will no longer be recommending this app to the vast amount of others I work with unless changed.",
            "I paid for this app in full to get the premium mode a year or so ago. Now it's asking me to pay for a new version. Go and get f***Rd. I actually loved this app and was my absolute preferred app for editing photos. You had to ruin it and get greedy shame on you. And do not bother commenting saying why don't you try the free 7 day trial... You've lost me as a customer seeya",
            "This app is trash! It just crashed on me. I unintalled. The reason I bought this app was to animate some charachters in gacha. If you plan to do that as well I do not reccomend it! Its too complex to even know how/where to use the chroma key (if there even is one), and it crashes way to easily for me. 1 star for me. Experience wasn't the best at all.",
            "EDIT: One problem is that adding an image downgrades the quality of that image a lot. REST: Honestly I think I hit the jackpot downloading this app first as an editing app. It has literally everything you could ever ask for in a photoshop app. The scene option at the very end is pretty fun to mess around with also. You can pay for premium, but that just gives you a few extra effects, atleast I think. Which means this is probably the best free editing app you can get out there right now.",
            "I used to luv this app.But when i started my subscription, the app started crashing. My subscription will end Nov 2020.Cant save an edited photo..it just keeps crashing.it's good i just subscribed for a month or else ive wasted my subscription fee for a longer period."

            "There is a bug where I would watch an ad to get a free spin, but it would load forever after watching, and I wouldn't get another spin. Hopefully this gets fixed, but the game is really fun otherwise, but thats a pretty big bug.",
            "Very well designed App. Good food for brain. But lots lots of Ads. Once ¬Ω of levels are completed more Ads (we can skip after 5 secs) will be pushed in between the levels. After completing ¬æ levels, App hangs after playing AD (these are 30secs Ads). For designing, complexity this App deserves 5 stars, but for Ads that are being pushed 2 stars is more than enough. Ads are killing the interest.",
            "Good game I have fun playing during downtime when I go to school but way to many ads after 1 round theres a ad and when you skip it, it gets stuck loading and I have to close the game over and over again.",
            "Best mind relaxing game ever. Whenever I fell bored I always one option to play which is this one. The creator has made it upon the mind of an artiststic person because every artist wants some interesting thing to do as this game.",
            "Very fun game and the ads aren't terrible. But it keeps freezing (loading forever) after almost every ad watched, requiring me to close and report the game. So, when I try to earn extra spins by watching an ad, I get screwed every time."

            "Great app for Japanese basics! However, some words are mistranslated slightly. For example, (I don't have a japanese keyboard so just bare with me.) \"Douzo,\" doesn't mean please, it means \"here you go\". Who, what, when, where, and how are also slightly mistranslated. For example, \"what\" would be \"nani,\" but the app says what means \"nan desu ka,\" which actually translates to \"what is...\" Do not reccommend if you are a beginner learner. Search up correct definitions if you used this app :)",
            "I would buy it if the \"phonetic\" setting could be fumaji and not just romaji. It really slows your progress reading roman characters. This is especially true when learning from an app, since the writing element is removed. Therefore, the app has limited value for me.",
            "Some annoying ads that pop up, which i can thankfully back out of, but its a very lovely app that has simple phrases to familiarize when you're learning japanese or when you plan to visit Japan and need simple phrases to get you by!",
            "I have no idea how accurate these are, but the presentation is streamlined. I've been through 5 sections,and the phrases seem to fit well. the male audio is very clear, extremely well recorded.",
            "During use will show 30+ seconds long full screen unstoppable ads, so cannot be used while actually communicating with others. Still useful while practicing when on your own hence why 2* stars."

            "As an original Kickstart backer in 2017, I have always been pleased with my purchase, until this last update. I can't begin to tell you how upsetting it is to go to your digital fence option to pull up history that's always been there until now. All the sudden, without warning, my history is limited and I'm supposed to pay a premium to access my data that was already there? Shameful..don't let greed get to your head. You'll lose customers. Sure hope this gets enough attention from the community.",
            "They introduced a premium subscription plan. This was not part of the deal. Deal was buy the fing box and you get all the software and features that come with it. Now they are finding ways to nickel and dime us and to keep us as paying customers. Every company does this. Offer an idea, back them up, you pay for the device and then the company now has millions of people with their device in their house. Then comes the hidden repeat business plan. Hate companies like this.",
            "This app used to be clean and simple, but now it gets more and more cluttered with each update. I used to use it exclusively, but now its so cluttered with \"features\" that it is almost impossible to find the features you need. It's so sad when a good app gets ruined like this, more features does not make an app better!!! It can if it's carefully designed but fing has totally failed in that regard. I have decided to move on and I am now using a different app that's more like Fing used to be.",
            "I've been using the fing app for a long time now and I really love it. I liked it so much that I bought a fingbox when they were still looking for funding on indiegogo. After updating the app today, I am disgusted to see that the developers have the audacity to offer \"premium\" features for a subscription. This action leaves a bitter taste in my mouth as this is how the developers treat the very people who enabled them to bring the fingbox to the market.",
            "Since Google doesn't provide enough characters for a thorough review of Fing, I'll just WARN anyone considering this app to look elsewhere. If history is any indication of what can be expected, then you need to know that paying a monthly subscription fee won't be any assurance that you'll get what you're paying for very long. And if competent Tech Support is important to you, then you definitely need to look elsewhere, because if you have a legitimate issue they can't fix, you will be ignored!"

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

I wish the internet was faster but it is Good for now thanks betternet keep up the good work I have recomend this app to many people and I use it for roblox and privacy security. But I was wondering if you guys can add a roblox server on the free server please k would really appreciate it and my friends would too",
            "Bad experience, my card has been charged after the free trial even after I uninstalled the app once I saw that it wasn't FREE. Stating that this app is free is very deceptive. Efforts to contact you for support to deactivate my card has been unsuccessful. I need to discontinue ASAP",
            "Sadly it's the only vpn that works at my school but other than that it sucks so bad, constantly bombarded with random pop up ads even when the apps not active. If you really really hate ads that randomly pop up while you're on apps that don't have ads then this vpn is not for you",
            "My experience with betternet is very bad. I am subscribed for premium pack in that services are not as promise. Unlimited data is not working without our mobile data pack. They are also i not refuning my money. X vpn better than this..",
            "I ONLY HAVE THIS TO STOP ROBLOX FROM CRASHING ON ME BUT THIS KEEPS. AND I MEAN IT. KEEPS PUTTING FULL. SCREEN. ADS. ON MY ENTIRE SCREEN. HORRIBLE! NEVER DO THIS AGAIN! AT LEAST PLAY AN AD WHEN WE'RE ON THE APP EVERY NOW AND AGAIN!"

Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this oneüò™",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

            "I wouldn't say its addicting or fun or anything. I'd say, it's good for people that just want a game, they don't care what game it is. I like it a lot, don't get me wrong, its a great game but everytime I play it, I feel like I deserve more. This game is awfully good but surprisingly bad. The levels do get a bit challenging as you move on, but with that, it lags my phone. Sometimes, when I watch an ad, it takes me back to a level I already finished, which is annoying. 3 stars because it's boring",
            "Your game is terrible, you only get like 10 moves. I would not download this, it takes up a lot of data. It is really bad. Please fix the moves, then I'll give you a better rating. I'd suggest you to not download this game before they fix this bug. I get strict sometimes, because I can't just find a good game to play when I'm bored for example: when I'm using a hotspot; when im on a roadtrip. Please fix this bug, then I might give you 4, or 5 Stars. And the Ads are constantly playing.",
            "Fun game. Ads are ridiculous and I am never going to watch an ad just to break one of the pies. For everyone out there, PUT ON AIRPLANE MODE. And also future apps, use airplane mode and never watch a stupid ad again. I will gladly pay $1 to remove ads, but anything above a dollar is not worth it. I understand why games need ads, but an ad forced upon you in the MIDDLE OF A GAME? Nope. I won't support that. Make removable ads a buck and I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "This game should tell us how many moves we have. Literally every other game that does something similar to this will tell us how many moves we have left. Is this intentional? I don't think it should be. Also, there is nothing fast-paced about this game. If you want it to be, maybe add a timer or different levels of difficulty if you haven't already. Each level of difficulty will give you a certain amount of time to complete the level. I'd enjoy the game a lot more if it was like that.",
            "VERY POOR, PLAY THIS IN AIRPLANE MODE! This games developers obviously want nothing more than an ad revenue. I will never understand how a game will make you watch so many ads just to get past 1 level. As soon as you score a whole pizza (every pizza) there is an ad. They don't even wait for the level to be completed. Not worth $2.99 for no ads."

            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "Had a problem with subscription features that as far as I know, cleared itself up (no support, clearing the cache didn't work. Did that, uninstalled and reinstalled and ensured I was logged into the correct account. Gave up, came back to the app a day later and was able to use HD features and all filters). It took a little less than support to respond, so that was good considering this is an app where you shouldn't run into many issues. Only issue, reorganizing your filter collection is a pain",
            "Used to be good but the quality fell, the filters aren't as good as they used to be, it is slow, and it suddenly became a subscription thing. There are very few filters, and the advert for the subscription or the free day trial keeps popping up every other moment. The few free filters are low quality and there doesn't appear to be many locked ones, so doesn't seem worth the money. Am very disappointed.",
            "The photo styles are great and I like that there is a choice of SD or HD, and that a variety of settings can be modified with the ease of a slider, however, the styles themselves are limited and there doesn't appear to be a way to include more (either as a freebie or paid). As much as I'm enjoying it, I don't see myself using it even the full year with that limitation. I'm on the fence as to whether it's worth the yearly cost. I have photoshop on my desktop; I'd be better off with that.",
            "amazing array of effects. totally engaging. few options that I wish were there: 1. search or filter effects based on criteria. Considering there are so many effects, searching through them to find the right one is time consuming. I wish they were sorted in categories or even better had a search option with facility t filter search results . 2. compare effects / compare with original option.",
            "Great app only problem is I used to be able to isolate a person and take the filter off only on the person or have the filter only on the person and the everything else normal. I really liked this feature and idk if it got removed or if it was moved and I can't find it."

            "I straight up didn't install this app. I've never used it or opened it either but it was taking up lots of my battery (about 1% which is a lot for an app that I have literally never opened). I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",
            "Complete Battery Hog. I have to disable the web protection settings or it chews up my battery life in a matter of hours. According to my battery usage stats, Verizon's \"anti-virus scanner\" uses up more battery than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Mobile Games. On some days, Combined. Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "I have been a subscriber with VERIZON for about 14 yrs. I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",

Cause of this happening to people much in proving is needed to correct the problems with this app here????? Unknown if app window problem location/link & intternet problem double check from your end.",
            "Since the app was installed i cannot access my printer to print emails from my phone. This app sucks. I originally thought it was my printer now I am finding out it is my phone. I have been a Verizon customer for years. I am considering a switch to another company."

            "Down loaded this app last night for my first purchase on YesStyle. While the products seem very nice and this is a good platform to buy Japanese and Korean cosmetics, however the price on this website/app is NOT transparent! The prices kept flutating and even when I proceed to the checkout stage, PayPal couldn't proceed with the payment as the total payable price increased by ¬£10 from my shopping basket. I found this practice disgraceful and totally not acceptable. I might not shop here again.",
            "They have wonderful products very cheap. But there are so many updates being made to the app. I have to update it like every week or 2. It is kind of frustrating. But amazing products.",
            "Pretty great, love the items. Problem is, that when they run out of items, it disappears from my wishlist. I don't remember what items I had, so please do not remove them from my wishlist because they might restock.",
            "Not the same anymore? Prices fluctuate and it used to be free shipping over $35 or so and now it's $60. The app itself seems to be better than the website which is a plus but the price changes and no more of the coupons for gold members?? Wth happened?",

In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to shortüòÄ but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",

I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",

I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players.

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game üëç‚ô•Ô∏èüëç‚ô•Ô∏è",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"
