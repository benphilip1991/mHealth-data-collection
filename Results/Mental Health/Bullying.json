            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "The bad; pin action is lacking and seem to be glued to floor. Wobbling pins rarely fall. The good; the ball action is quite good for the most part although speed control doesn't seem to be an option. Getting the ball to hook is a challenge as once released there is no control like other apps. It's very different from most apps in that everything is available from the start. The alleys and choice of balls ready to play. The music is different for all the alleys and mostly very nice listening.",
            "Reducing my rating front a 6 start to 2. Ads, the address have become nasty, obtrusive, annoying. I play this game far less nose than in the past because all the ads play sound and I found this out the first time in an environment where my phone should have been very quiet. What changed, greed in sure. This same shirt of thing is happening with all kinds of apps and it's really causing me to rethink what things I need and those I don't.",
            "Notice to all gamers if you want to play the games you have installed on your devices without having to be bothered by ads turn off your mobile data before you start the game and the game will play fine and the ads will not get through, no more ads ever. Its enough to have to pay for the use of the device we should not have to pay for the ads also, enough is ENOUGH!!!!!!",
            "Such a bad game because there's too many ads, when you aim left or right it goes the oppisite direction and the graphics are so bad in this game such a silly bowling game, other bowling games are way better than this one, Im uninstalling this game because it sucks👎👎👎",
            "Great game it's fun and time consuming but it would be better if you can add more colors to play with and more design and there is A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF ADS so it's awsome also you should add a computer mode with different difficultys it's a fun game I recommend it for everyone"

I could only complete 2 levels, and after I did, I had to pay around 20$. I, of course did not do it. I'm not happy with this game at all. It looks almost promising, but it's literally a bad version of Rockstar Games' Bully. That's my overall experience. This game is not the worst, but it's still bad.",

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

            "It's getting a bit boring but still good.I like it but I have ideas for the game: 1.You can go on mission mode and kill people thats your rival. 2.you can maybe add more pets and animals? 3. You can create your own clothes. 4. Maybe add some rivals if they kiss your senpai? 5. Add more clothes and stockings/socks? 6. You can change your shoes and push someone off the roof? 7. Maybe add more accessories and eyes. 8. Maybe you have new methods to kill students? Anyways, I hope this gets added. Thx",
            "Not bad, but the problem is that when you ride any vehicle as soon as you jumped the vehicle starts jumping as well and I don't like that you can jump so high and the jumping animation is a bit weird, also when a teacher calls the police, I don't like that the cops keep looking at me at any direction and keep pointing their guns, marching slowly, and patrolling the area like a SWAT or FBI and add an invisible wall for all corners of the map cause sometimes you get knocked out of the map.",
            "I really like that you can make your own character I like that if you automatically make a boy and a girl they're automatically together and if you don't want to be with him or you can give it to you can give the car to different person and you'll break up with him and you can even give it to a girl the Quarry I mean it's so cool sorry I missed spelling one of these some of these things sorry I'm not making sense spider games really cool you should install it or they will be spider in your bed",
            "I love this game!! But i would like you to add these for updates More better hairstyles Hugs A basement with a chair to kidnap someone A sleeping syringe(i cant spell it) More weapons (like chainsaw and circular saw) Also the new faculty New nurse office Normal looking students Thats all (im not like gonna beg you to do this but if u did it that would cool)",
            "I really like it but may add some more stuff we can do 1add drowning in the game 2make shopkeeper buy more stuff 3make senpai hug not in game kiss in game picking up people and character not in game make us pick people up too not in game 4please add this all 5add a sleeping surinch and add a basement where you can tie and tie them in a chair please add👈🏻👁️👄👁️👉🏻"

            "Its an amazing game! I've been playing it for the past few years. Its a ripoff of minecraft but free like its soooo good. But then it suddenly stopped working, is it something about my device or is it a glitch... If you have this problem there is a SIPER DUPER EXELLENT GAME called Mini world Block art like pls download the game it barely takes up ur storage and so has soo many cool textures like cartoon mini and realistic, there's gallery with gives u a bunch of different maps. PLS DOWNLOAD.",
            "Great game, but I wish there was a setting to turn the in-game sound off. I love listening to my music while playing games, but the background noise from the game interrupts my music and I can't turn the volume down without turning my music down with it. Maybe include a setting to turn off in-game sound and I'll give 5 stars. 😊 Other than that, fun game.",
            "\"Crafting and Building\", an exact replica of the amazing game, \"Minecraft\". No, it may not look the same but if you go to settings then tap on texture packs, it actually lets you change the game to look like the original Minecraft! I really prefer this game if you dont want to waste money on the actual thing :)",
            "I like this game so much because the building is much much better!!!!!!!!!!!! Hmmm the back ground is perfect but.... it need someplace that i can build my house oh but me and my friends are here to have fun and i also can I believe i can fly way up in the clouds, rain, snow and the sun oh and i have a secret way if you can dig it well let opening side of when you dig wile i have a lot of fun playing this game."

            "This game is an amazing game. Easily one of the best racing games that you will find on the app store (especially for free). I would easily give this 5 stars... If it weren't for the \"steal\" power up. Easily takes out 50% of the fun. I've still spent more hours than I'm proud of playing this game as it is fun, but nothing is more aggravating than losing your powerups again and again. If they come out with a beach buggy racing 3 and that powerup is still in the game, then I won't be playing it.",
            "This is a very good racing game. At first when I installed it, I was addicted to this game but after few months I was bored. The power ups in this game is totally very bad. It can make a racer to come down from 1st position to last position. Yeah tough games are very entertaining to play but when ever you play this game, it is very difficult to come first and cars and characters unlock very late. To unlock the cars and characters, you to play for many times. But overall good game.",
            "Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! A must download for everyone. 5 Stars is too small for this game. I must add that there should be an ugrade to enable one check previous page and choose for yourself which one to play not the game choosing for you to play, that's my only problem with the game,all I want is like that's of the Beach buggy racing 1.",
            "Since the last update, this game has not be in good shape. Everything has gone wayward. Sometimes when playing I see my racer under the surface while I'm on the raod of the race coarse. Then it says wrong way, making my racer restarts from where it happened. Update is supposed to improve the game not to make it loose it value of play. Developers WHY!!!",
            "Its a good game. I didn't put 5 stars because I can't play against friends and the characters oog oog and the ghost pirate guy are horrible. This game needs multiplayer but we don't need to pay for it and get rid of oog oog and the ghost pirate guy and replace them with different characters please. Then I will put a 5 star review."

            "Nice game, slightly complicated in the beginning, but after about half hour, you're pretty much up to speed. Was surprised to find that you need stamina, not energy to do jobs, so don't make the same mistake I did. Still love the game though, six months on and I'm truly hooked!",
            "I think the idea is great I think probably in time to the Creator you could definitely evolve this game into something far more graphic it is fun and it does put down just about how it goes on the streets for someone who's bout it. And all I think the game is great and it's good for killing time and connection with people",
            "Was a good game, have to give it 1 star tho. I've lost 3 accounts on three devices and the devs won't do anything about it. My thinking is if I would of put money into the game they'd move mountains for me but I haven't so I'm just a number in the system lol. The games only so so it could be developed more and have less glitches. I used to recommend this game to people but I don't anymore",
            "I have been searching for this type of game for months. Downtown Mafia, brings me back to the Myspace days, a game either Mobster or iMobster, but this one is extremely rewarding to play and the users on it are actively playing. it feels way better than the Myspace game. Keep up the good work.",
            "I like the new special tournaments that reward diamonds based on how well your gang did and daily diamonds during sales is nice. Overall the game is improving. There will always be players who have invested way more money and are stronger but that's how most games are."

            "game is best but including to weapons ,armor , shoes ,helmet with upgrade skills the cost is so highly taking cash that you can't affort if you taking any enjoyment with it. you have to just do many hardworks including ads and playing survival mode to earn cash . game is good but have highly price and difficult and frastrating to earn then you win the story of the game . you do one think in increasement weapon or skills because both want high upgrades of cash. 🙄🙄",
            "Great game, it's one of the best you can get considering it's size is small mb though last update of the game is last year ago maybe if y'all rate 5 stars the developers would work for newer updates again so if you're reading this review don't you hesitate get this game!!🔥",

            "This resembles the real thing when it comes to bowling. I have bowled for many years and this game teaches you in where to roll the ball for a solid pocket strike. Not every pocket hit delivers a strike but neither does a pocket hit deliver a strike in actual bowling. Have fun--good luck and good bowling",

            "Starting out giving the game five Stars. So far okay. We shall see. The graphics in the game are so so just okay not that great. It's like all the other Google app store games if you want to play you're going to have to pay. And you know what! I really don't mind paying a developer real money if the game is really good and really fair and no cheating and no game fixing. Unfortunately ! Most games on Google are letting alot of players cheat ! I hate losing to a p o s cheater .",
            "Good graphics, decent gameplay but....it's set up too make you lose. Fake bot players programmed to make you win in the beginning and then once you're hooked after a few wins, you start losing. That concept is called pay-to-play. As you lose, unsurprisingly, cue the ads to buy more in-game coin. I'm not naive, I know it's a model used by most games but here it's so obvious it dulls the game. There are better bowling games out there that at least allows you to enjoy the gameplay.",
            "Bowling King is very fun but you might ask why did I give it a four-star because you could accidentally Mash something and buy it but what is really cool like some other game you have to buy a lot but in this game you can watch an ad get diamond cash coins this app is really cool and I encourage you to get it it's totally free unless you want to buy chips hope you like it.",
            "This game has been acting up for the past month. The configuration is way off! First, it changed the color of my lane...just like that! Unable to change it back. Then you can't maneuver the ball correctly. If you aim the ball either to the left or right, that's an automatic gutter ball. Please fix whatever's going on!! I love this game and I would hate to delete it!",
            "What an exciting and enjoyable APP that is realistic and challenging. Thank you. It's always a pleasure using this bowling APP. I have tried other bowling apps and always come back to this one. Thank you for the GREAT entertainment. Back for more fun. Thank you!"

            "I have loved this game for YEARS, it may be VERY VERY pay to win, but it's not a very competitive game, it's also very easy to get the resources you need, however there is a very big shortage of houses, i think that the house vendor should come back, but also, the halloween event where the map was redesigned (school at least) looks SO COOL and the new story quests just make it even better! thanks VNL!!!",
            "I like this game but pls add something very angry to me when I choose high graphics in the game It just lags then I wish i Could go back to Medium graphics pls fix the lag so that I could never lag again when I went to the Temple or the Outside because sometimes I Jump and thw lag camed then I died? Pls fix it",
            "I love this game but there's one problem there's a server maintenance every day every week come on fix that ok and dont remove the guest the new players to get a new server don't remove us please vnl entertainment a update button on playstore in someone want to update the game ok and i want to play please (vnl entertainment how long do you fix this please.)",
            "ive been playing since 2014 and it is great game Okay so this is a 2020 update. This game is still good and city is the best the only reason i didnt switch to city is because i didnt want to start all over but its still a good game. Make it easier to find suits for lvl 100",
            "Dude this ain't even a game.The animations are trash and it is so brutal to see that we wear watermelon gear and a teddy bear bag pack and we get picked on.The zombies don't even look like zombies and the server restarts and the next time you come the same thing happens.Fix this now or face my wrath!!!"

            "Good game but need many update required. There is many cards 4 the 10.11,12 mansion but only have 4 entry , cards R useless though it has more in higher mansion.Mansions R. are aded rapidly even mansion 15 but no other/extra defense added . And also no troop added ,so same raiding style is done ever And the timer of superior crew too much long , about 2 weeks is. perfect.Furtherly, 4 the war, pls happen it to players. selected by boss , underboss. There Is poor network connection server.",
            "The fighting mechanics are so unbalanced. People got smart, and used their invite code to rack up on gold. See what they did was make fake accounts with the invite codes to their main base. So they would use the account untill lvl 8 or 10, which is really easy to do. Then their main base would get like 1k gold for 5 mins a day . They allowed Hero cards to be so strong, u can take an entire base out. Idk why the devs allowed them to get so strong. The game is unbalanced. Now the game is ruined.",
            "It's all amazing game, the developer always make fast respond regarding some problem about the game. But once they find out you are not gold buyer, *POOF* They're gone and your mail will remain invicible after that... No response anymore and your email probably got blocked. They will always making lot of excuse to resend our request on email but nope, once they know you are not gold buyer either they will respond 1 year later or you will not get any service from them. What an amazing staff.",
            "This game is awesome. But the card system sucks and updates comes only after ages. Still updates ruin the system. For me only gold buyers and other some well settled mafia gets good resources to upgrade. In housing 11+ big opponents with squat cards how can we manage? And level 15mansion with level 8/9housing and gets good loot and start building plenty green walls. It's kinda bull>_< and why don't you arrange only after some resources upgrade only mansion upgrade unlocks? Reply mails first."

        "comments": [
            "I love it, I got scammed a while back in a raffle but other than that it's a really fun game. It's fun to see that it has been updated and kept alive, it does warm my heart! It's not perfect and it has flaws, such as a lot of micro transactions and all. That wouldn't be a problem if the PVE was just as good as the pvp. It would be amazing if the campaign got some love, I get that it's a farming zone for materials. But it would be really exciting to see some more chapters and more pve content.",
            "Really Good Game I really enjoy playing as you can replay characters to gain more coins if you don't want to spend actual money purchasing coins and notes. This is fun to play since it has maturity of the South Park characters like Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters and etc. If you keep struggling you can replay a old level. Enjoy this game since I enjoy watching South Park. Hope to see more things added to this game in the future. Good work.",
            "I've loved this game up until level 12, number 59! It keeps messing up and wont play right. The 1st castle guy wont die or show his health bar. It will just keep going on and on even when I have every card playing. Please fix this. Also I've spent so much money on this game & I thought the updates was supposed to help that. It hasn't! Last thing I'll b@&%h about is the pvp matchup is very unfair. Esp. when I'm not even level 4 & u match me with others who are way higher. I just dont get that!",
            "I give this game five stars because the graphics are great. One thing I really admire about this game is the character selection. They have so many people to collect and upgrade. As some one who really loves South Park it's good to know that they still keep the creativity and negativity, I thank everyone who created the show and this amazing game.",
            "KICK A**! I see all these negative comments, but it looks as though the game has been updated and fixed. And you don't have to spend actual money on this game to have fun, they give you so many options to earn what you need to upgrade your cards, earn money and C points and more. But you guys who complain are the younger generation from me. You don't understand games like I do. Im the keyboard cowboy...ironic name, hu? Lol anyways Creators, just wanna say thnx. But mostly to Matt & Trey."

            "Yo such a good game! But it should let u talk. Like when someone ask u to do something or ask u something or wants to trade with u, u can only say something on there but u only have 2 opinions. Also, u should be able to custumize ur charaecter, like if u dont want to pick a student in the school, u can custumize ur own charaecter! Also, there should be graduation so i think the charaecters should start of at pre k or kindergarden. So then they can go to 1st grade 2nd grade 3rd grade etc.",

When the game takes away you controls it just means the mental state is very bad and you have gone mad. This is to the person that said the game is trash. Better read this and stop trashing this awesome game. Love you all. Give us more",

I went into the cafeteria ate some food then when I went out the controls disappeared including the joystick thing to move around! And in the top left corner there is was this weird glitching thing it looks like some kind of school kid in the game holding money and was glitching! I tried exiting the game but that didn't work! Don't install this game is totally trash!!",

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "Game is fun BUT if you get stuck and hit the walk through (light buld) button, there are SO MANY freaking ads to go through before getting to the damn video. Got to a certain level and couldn't figure it out, couldn't get to the damn video because 6, SIX videos I could not back out of had to play. By the time the video showed up, here come 2 more videos that you can't back out of! Turn off your wifi/data while playing the game! LOL!",

            "I enjoyed the game. But half way through, at level 9 of 18, it said that the next level was locked and that I could purchase the rest of the game. I don't know why it was labeled \"free\" when you have to pay to play. I wouldn't have downloaded it if I knew that I couldn't play the whole thing.",
            "This game is the dumbest game ever because, however the game will not let you get the disc in the 2 level . The game don't have a hammer and the glass will not open haw will you ever get the disc if you don't have a hammer or can NOT open the glass . there are no codes so haw can you get the door unlocked , if you don't have a code haw are you getting out of the 2 room .the game is really stupid .the definition of this game is stupidity !!!!!!! The game is very dumb , but the real question is who is the person that made this game because they should be ashamed of themselves .the person that made this game is really , really stupid because the game don't have the things that you need how are you getting out of that room if you do not have the stuff that you need .If it was a key I would understand , but there is no key or hemmer and the glass will not open the only reason I hate hate this game is because there are no no no things you can get out with , and I know no one will read this but I hope that you got my pont of view !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Because I don't have to worry about messing up any of the saves so much like I have ever had something happen to any of my saves.

            "It must be very hard writing a natural-feeling bowling game—but this is so strangely, stiffy unrealistic, it seems like a parody. You can't pick up the ball to throw it—you push it away, on the ground? It then rolls at one speed, no matter how hard you \"threw\" (pushed)? You then _steer_ it, like you're running down the lane after it? Finally, it rushes forward, cartoon-like, just before reaching the pins? Sorry, but I'm not sure why anyone would play this… It's as unlike bowling as you can get.",
            "This is truly the best and most realistic bowling game I've tried! Spares are alot easier for me since I've learned how to correct an errant shot by curving the Ball with a Left or right swip. Thanks for this really great game guys!☺️ After playing this game for months I finally rolled a 300. It proves that the more you play the better you can get. It's still the best bowling game out there! Thanks again Winter light!",
            "Started out liking this game. It doesn't keep score right. Knocks down pins after the ball has gone by doesn't even come close to the pins. If there is a player with high score it gives the win with cheating by the computer you don't have control of the your game. Also changes score in middle of game. Will put a strike on other players game. Watched it happen bunches of times.",
            "I will most likely I'm install this game for several different reasons. Number one you are forcing people to watch 30 second videos with drain our battery power. II all of the alleys are unlocked I mostly all the balls are unlocked so all The Thrill is Gone. Number three there is no way and a person can have a game with a 230 average your game is becoming very boring I know also that background music is very depressing. You need a major upgrade.",
            "I love this app 🤩💕💞 Ad free is perfect. 99% of my games I win without accruing any points. Some days I don't face a bowler better than me..so I don't advance. Rather than play every newbie(no shade::: everyone has to learn), I disconnect and force the app to shut down to maintain my rating then I reopen. Consider in your next update, incentives( 1-2 points) for playing/winning and finishing any match. Wifi to surround system/it's like Wwwwowwww 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆"

        "description": "This game is not what it seems...\r\n\r\nInspired by creepy/bad edutainment games from the 90s, Baldi's Basics is a meta horror game that's really weird, with no real educational value to be found. The goal of the game is to collect seven notebooks, and then escape the school, but that's easier said than done! You'll need to learn all the ins-and-outs of the game to come up with a winning strategy and avoid being caught by Baldi. Learning how to use Baldi's friends to your advantage, wisely managing the items found throughout the school, and memorizing the layout of Baldi's school are all keys to success!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game has two modes, story and endless!\r\n\r\n• Story mode requires you to collect 7 notebooks and then escape the school to win. The more notebooks you collect, the faster Baldi will become! Simple, but very challenging.\r\n\r\n• Endless mode is a challenge to see how many notebooks you can collect before being caught by Baldi. Over time Baldi will speed up, but each time you successfully solve the problems in a notebook he'll slow down. The longer you can keep his speed down, the more notebooks you can collect!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an official port of the original game with touch screen controls and controller support!

            "This game is so addictive, it isn't really that scary but quite thrilling and fun! I play this game all the time and absolutely love it. My favourite character would be First Prize, he actually helped me escape Baldi a few times! I love all the little hints merged in the game, like the posters, safety scissors, BSoda, energy flavoured zesty bar, etc. Def giving this game five stars! :)",
            "I say this game reaches it's potential and purpose to be an escaping game. It's more like a thriller game than a horror game. The characters are annoyingly good, it makes the game harder/challenging. The graphics look interesting, as in pixilated, though I see the appeal, and the colors are more vivid. Great game, just falls off on the horror game a little bit, but the catching up of Baldi is intensifying.",
            "I mean, its a good game and all but when I started, I moved the screen the tiniest bit and it literally did a whole 180° degrees and there was no way I was going to get away from Baldi if that was going to happen because I'll be running all over the place xD but if there is a way to make the screen not move so fast please tell me or if the feature is not added yet, please add it so that the sensitivity is lower or fix it if its a bug because I'm not sure if its suposed to happen",
            "I would give it five stars but I want new updates on it. it's a really great job but could you make baldi not break his arm while he's waving at you? I think it might really hurt him. Great graphics and a really fun game! If you like scary games and you also like math, this is the game for you! But the controls are kind of hard.",
            "This game is great for how much time they had to make it in! For people wondering about the game it is a horror game NOT a learning game as it says at the start. If you want to change the sensitivity the options is in the menu. Theres an impossible question on 6 of the 7 books, that is part of the game not a glitch. I haven't had any ads while playing it. Overall great game for a quick thing to play!"

Hockey. Football. And castle and base defense game. And more! And i also want a game with full of incredible story! But its hard to find my favourite games in this app. Maybe u can add something like FAVOURITE GAMES BUTTON? And also more incredible brain-struggling question games :D! THANK YOU!!!",
            "I haven't played it yet old games before, but now it seems it was good, not bad at all, some games are not good (I don't personal play it), some games are good (only my favorites). No ads, no pay purchases, and offline (no need internet required online, that's great), it's totally free.",
            "Gave 3 stars because while the games themselves were fun back in the day, it's almost impossible to play them in the format presented here. Games like Brick Breaker, Midnight Bowling, and Midnight Pool are the main ones; the tiny screen you play them on makes it almost impossible to see what's going on. If this game is given the options for touch as well as full screen, I'll change my rating.",
            "I just want to play spiderman unlimited.... That was the BEST GAME EVER. Why the hell did you get rid of it... Please, if you search you will see many people love it... And if it was for profit, then put the game to 4 dollars or something. I would totally buy it without thinking. And many would say the same"

        "description": "Use the Report Bullying App by No Bullying Schools to send a confidential report directly to your School Administrators. The app can be used by Students, Parents, or School Staff, and your report will be stored in a confidential database that only your School Administrators can see. You can leave your name or remain anonymous, and you can even upload screenshots of cyberbullying.\r\n\r\nNeed to report something else besides bullying? The app allows you to report any type of incident, from bullying and cyberbullying, to at-risk behavior, peer conflict, mental health issues, and much more.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind: the app only works if your school is already a member of No Bullying Schools. Not sure if your school is a member? Just ask your School Counselor or Principal. Schools can SIGN-UP for a free live demo on our website at https://NoBullyingSchools.com.\r\n\r\nBULLYING PREVENTION SOFTWARE: When an incident is reported, School Administrators get an automatic email alert, reminding them to login to our secure software and view the new report. In our software they can see every incident for their school, make follow up notes, update the incident status, and add a Positive Action Plan.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL CULTURE DATA TRACKING: No Bullying Schools is the FIRST PROGRAM EVER to automatically track school culture, showing the difference between \"All Reported Incidents\" and \"Confirmed Incidents.\" No Bullying Schools helps School Administrators monitor their school in real-time with colorful charts and graphs that show the increase or decrease of incidents over time.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE SCENARIO: Let’s say \"Anytown High School\" (our fictional example school) received 20 Incident Reports this past school year. Any educator knows that \"20 Reports\" doesn’t tell the full story. Let’s say 5 of the incidents were misreported as “bullying” (when they were actually peer conflict or even teasing), another 5 reports were duplicate reports (meaning multiple kids reported the exact same incident), still another 5 reports were still “Under Investigation,” and finally the school found 5 reports to be “Confirmed Incidents.” (Wow - even our example scenario is getting complicated!) Good news: No Bullying Schools makes it easy for you. Our software automatically tracks these differences on our DATA PAGE, with smart charts that help “tell the full story” of your school’s culture.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM: The No Bullying Schools Software is an evidence-based program for monitoring bullying and providing a multi-tiered system of supports for K-12 Schools. It comes with a year-round VIDEO CURRICULUM for students presented by award winning author and founder of No Bullying Schools, Tom Thelen.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP for a free live demo on our website at https://NoBullyingSchools.com.",

In our software they can see every incident for their school, make follow up notes, update the incident status, and add a Positive Action Plan.<br><br>SCHOOL CULTURE DATA TRACKING: No Bullying Schools is the FIRST PROGRAM EVER to automatically track school culture, showing the difference between &quot;All Reported Incidents&quot; and &quot;Confirmed Incidents.&quot; No Bullying Schools helps School Administrators monitor their school in real-time with colorful charts and graphs that show the increase or decrease of incidents over time.<br><br>EXAMPLE SCENARIO: Let’s say &quot;Anytown High School&quot; (our fictional example school) received 20 Incident Reports this past school year. Any educator knows that &quot;20 Reports&quot; doesn’t tell the full story. Let’s say 5 of the incidents were misreported as “bullying” (when they were actually peer conflict or even teasing), another 5 reports were duplicate reports (meaning multiple kids reported the exact same incident), still another 5 reports were still “Under Investigation,” and finally the school found 5 reports to be “Confirmed Incidents.” (Wow - even our example scenario is getting complicated!) Good news: No Bullying Schools makes it easy for you. Our software automatically tracks these differences on our DATA PAGE, with smart charts that help “tell the full story” of your school’s culture.<br><br>EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM: The No Bullying Schools Software is an evidence-based program for monitoring bullying and providing a multi-tiered system of supports for K-12 Schools. It comes with a year-round VIDEO CURRICULUM for students presented by award winning author and founder of No Bullying Schools, Tom Thelen.<br><br>SIGN UP for a free live demo on our website at https://NoBullyingSchools.com.",

Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",

But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",

            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers 🤘✌😎",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."

            "Absolutely life changing! I've never known love until I played this game.🥺 For years I have been pained by the fact that my father left me💔. I never thought I'd never experience happiness and love again😪💔. However, this gamed changed that for me. The graphics are immaculate, the story line is Emmy nomination quality. Truly godly.🙏",
            "The game hasn't changed abit since the last time i played. Its still horrible and the character walks so slow. The characters look scary and eveything is so far away its frustrating the school is actually a gym and all of the good reviews are fake by the way",
            "It's really hard to figure out what to do in the levels and the music it's really annoying and pretty loud, there should be an option to turn it off, but aside from that I think it's an ok game",
            "I like the game but there still is room for more improvements: 1) improve the graphics the characters are scary 2) change the clothes it's not nice it looks weird 3) enable an option to run because it's kind of annoying to walk slowly 4) fix some bugs and glitches I witnessed a glitch and I wasn't able to play level 6 where your supposed to drive the car 5) please get stop playing ads every time u finish a level it's frustrating",
            "Once you put the breakfast tray on the side it freezes and you have no option but to quit the game I even restarted the phone 6 time and I kept uninstalling it and installing it but nothing works and when you work around it's a bit awkward because the camera goes into the walls when you turn a corner and it turns 1st person when you go into a room overall a good game and also the characters look ..(I'm speechless)please add more characters please I hope I didn't offend you your doing a great job"

            "The game weights very few bytes and is lots of fun. The only downside has to be the controls. They are a bit tiny, but still managable. You can customize them but i just like to stick to vanilla settings. Maybe ill consider in the future. Overall great game, minigames are great as well. Can definetly recommend.",
            "I finally achieved the 100% completion of the game. The storyline overall was okay, though I do not find any improvement whatsoever when it comes to it. It is still your typical revenge-type action game. The controls are okay and the gameplay was so dynamic. The cutscenes are also the highlight of the game. The comic book-like character designs are pleasing to watch.",
            "This game is fantastic, and I would've given 5 stars but I got a new phone last week and tried to reinstall the game, it now won't download because it thinks I haven't bought the game.....which I have. I've been playing this game on android since I bought it on release. Please fix and I'll give 5 stars again.",
            "Very unique, feels like it was meant to be played on your phone rather than a console. It's perfect for on the go, audio isn't even necessary. If you can, I'd play the other GTA games on a console. If you're looking for a GTA app, I'd go with this.",
            "The mission \"Double Trouble\" has a bug that basically blocks the ability to move forward with the game. The accelerate, reverse and steer buttons do not respond when touching. Can you please fix this R* or get a refund?"

            "Originally gave a 5 star, but there are bugs that prevent you from progressing in the game. I reported the bugs and was met with a generic message stating that \"others have reported the same issue\" and that \"it is being worked on\". After a few weeks of additional play, it is apparent that there are no plans to correct the issues. I'm sure they are working on the more recent games that were released, but that means that this game is no longer worth playing. Still fun time killer, so I not 1 ☆",
            "Definitely deserves 5 stars. This is probably one of the most generous games that I have ever played. I was rewarded very handsomely for my grinds. I already own a handful of 5-star items as well as claimed 7 turfs, all in just about a week. However, I ran into a few issues which hampered my progress. The one that bothers me most is the lack of responsiveness of the acceleration pedals and the left arrow of the vehicular controls. This always made me lose out in vehicle missions. Please fix.🙏🙏",
            "Awsome game, tho i think there should be more to the story, the map should be bigger, there should be an online mode where players can join guilds and interact with each other, and you should be able to take the thug allies u find with u on missions, and make side missions as well as the option to redo a misson. Last thing is there should be an option to sign out of your current google profile, wich i cant find. Just my opinion on future game updates👍",
            "I am playing this game from three days and I enjoyed it a lot. It's definitely worth 5 stars. But I am giving it 4 stars due to two reasons. First, Controls lack clarity, controls should be more comprehensive and some more controls should be added so that we could enjoy a proper Gunfight.Second, whenever I Ride a Car or bike or any other vehicle, system should show the name of the vehicle and there is no speedometer. Gauging Speed in Speedometer while riding a car enhances driving experience.",
            "The game is excellent. Graphics and storyline is good but there are some problems like 1. It took much time to initiate the game. 2. I have honor 9n mobile phone with 4gb ram and 64 gb internal memory even though game lags. 3. You guys should add controls customization setting and change one thing that when we try to shoot some one it takes auto aim. It should not be doing this. I want to shoot according to my choice. 4. Also add a jump button."

Even if they're not in a bullying situation your child can use it to let you know they're safe.

You won't miss a single word with the ultra sensitive mic adaption inbuilt. Great for identifying the speaker of the minute via a name tagging system. Not one hundred percent automated but damn worth the download. Great app for P&C meetings, GM meetings and even Toastmasters. Your minutes are taken care of."

            "Super fun, as remembered on the Playstation 2. Looks and feels virtually the same on my phone, but the controls are not great. I feel like this game isn't tolerable without a remote controller. For the record, 5 stars with a controller..",
            "Cool port. Never played the original. The story is good and the cut scenes are artistic. Shooters like this make for poor ports. It's so hard to control your character that you have to save your progress constantly everytime you do something right if you aren't playing on the easiest difficulty. Be prepared to constantly play the same encounters again and again until you get it right.",
            "It is awesome...its Max Payne. Its dark and its dystopian and it borders on delusional and disturbing as well as delightful and demonstrates the destruction that organized crime and corruption has on big cities and how hard it is for the good guys to take it all on just to try to is usually a fast trip to the morgue and if not then a trail of bodies will be how they can track you. Starting with your family. If the boss gets whacked it becomes a war zone. Not a good thing either way.",
            "This is one of the best FPS that i have played. I did complete it on PC but couldn't stop myself from playing on Android. Awsome graphics and bullet time combo is the best past he first of it's kind when no one thought about it in the first place when it was first releases on PC",
            "I really wish that there were more mobile ports like this. Amazon got rid of Dead Space, and I can't even find Resident Evil 4. GTA and Final fantasy are about all I ever find. I love this game, it works perfectly with my Ipega controller too!"

            "This game is trash when you reach a certain level. It purposefully gives you the wrong color bubbles when there's only color changing bubbles left on the board so you have to use your boosters and watch commercials. Time to uninstall.",
            "I used to love this game but since the latest update released on 29 October, the beam shot no longer works properly. It is only destroying the bubbles you can see on the screen and not to the top.",
            "It's a good game for a while. After a bit, though, it gets to the point where the levels are too hard to beat without 4 or 5 tries. There's no way to lessen or in any way control the difficulty level. It would be nice if there were a way to choose your difficulty level that you wanted to play each day. This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",
            "The issue with getting not getting the colored right ball to progress through the level is still happening. Please make the rainbow ball more useful. I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors. The balls with the \"-\" are annoying. On the first level with it it's impossible not to pop especially with blaster. Also the previous issues have not been fixed."

            "It was a great game I just wish it had more levels and more educational subjects too, I like to be a geek even though I'm not in school because the pandemic and I had my babygirl in January 2020.I figure this came can bring my attention and I'm also learning without noticing or sharpen my memory. I am 32😁😁😁",
            "BEST GAME EVER👌! this game is the best i have ever played in my life. I advice you all to download this game. There maybe many ads as all of you said . But you can't deny it, it is very interesting. U can all thank me later after downloading it. Keep the good work up guys 😉👍",
            "I love the game!!!!! Would give five stars am not that far along but Only problem i have is where i have to keep scrolling through to get at the level i am going to start. Example: am at level 13 when i finish this level and go back to the selection it starts again from 1 what if there is level 100 would i scroll right back from 1 ????? Please fix",
            "This game is fantastic but it only have 12 levels or so there must be more levels like 230.that is why I gave four 🌟.please fix it and you can get five stars."

            "I've been a grindr unlim. user from the time it rolled out but it seems the longer the lifespan of grindr, the worse it gets. I mean, I got so fed up with it Im no longer unlmtd. But wait the amount of ads is beyond necessary and shows they've lost sight of their initial mission. To b forced to watch ads after every profile view, block, or whatever is pathetic. The spamming, the bots, the not sending/connecting. scruff doesn't have these problems, why does Grindr. Its disappointing",
            "I really would like to leave a positive review. Unfortunately for years the messages which are sent, stay just as sent in inboxes all over the world. Just Google it and many people experience the same. This is a basic functionality of a chat/dating app and even that is not working properly. It is okay as free version, but having paid several times now, I expect more than what I get.",
            "I get 50 new messages a day. From people who know I'm not interested. Blocking them is pointless because they make alts. When I do try to block, I have to sit through an ad every single time. Half the time the X doesn't work. I can't find what I'm looking for unless I pay. There is no way to make myself hidden from certain people. Or to automatically keep nudes at bay. So I am subject to daily sexual harassment while trying to make meaningful connections.",
            "It's ad driven yes . Chats are free that's a huge plus in today's \" pay to view \" market . Ads can be a pain , but it's a nessasary pain when you think of the alternative. Should have twice the amount of photos on your profile available. And some tweaking and expanding of the profile description. Blocking taps should be free as many are spam. All in all Grindr gets me far more dates , friends than any other . 👍",
            "This app used to be good - years ago, it's gotten worse with every update as more free features are moved to subscription only. Taps all dated '1 Jan.' Pay walls everywhere. Intrusive ads everywhere. Bots everywhere and yes, they're reported (as you'll suggest in your reply) but they just reappear. Political correctness gone crazy: removing ethnicity filters. It's called sexual preferences you snowflakes. This is why your app rating has dropped to 3.0/5.0. Subscriptions are extortionate."

            "This game is really great, and possibly the only app that is almost similar to the real Minecraft! I am only giving two stars because, I join one of the three servers that are provided but, it kicks me out after 3 seconds!! I try to play or do an actual game but I can't because, it randomly kicks me out and sends me back to the beginning. It would be incredible and the best if you could fix the bug!",
            "Its game suck there was an old version that i download it was the best and this game is a disapointment the picture looks cool but its not what it looks in your mind so don't download this game its a wast of your time!!!!!",
            "This game really sucks. Every time I try to go and play the game, it will go right back to the beginning screen and kick me out of my world. Also, when I can actually go in the world, the only thing I can do is stand there, I can do anything. This game is a waste of your time and storage space. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!!!! ITS JUST A WASTE OF YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!"

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

            "Good game and all but it needs a lot of work on the controls there is this thing it does all the time where when I'm driving it will just randomly Veer to the right. I've had the same problem with San Andreas in Bully but nowhere near as much as I have had with this game. Thought it was my phone at first but it was doing this on my old phone as well so it can't be. Aside from that it's the same fun headache that it was back on PS2",
            "It's okay it's not the best and could be much better! Controls are not good at all keeps glitching, in the middle of. a mission it keeps throwing me out of the app and I have to restart the mission where I have to steal the boat! Can't change the radio!! So for something I needed to pay 6 euros it shouldn't have this amount of problems, especially throwing me out of the game!",
            "Good old vice city .Great game , easy to finish with the mobile controls,even without cheats . The anniversary edition has weird handling ,unlike the Playstation and pc versions ,some vehicles are useless with this handling ,easy to win races as the other racers often crash due to the new handling. Graphics are great or as good as the original game . The handling does feel like gta 4,which was great imo,but this one can be dissappointing at times . Was this port developed by rockstar ?",
            "Four stars for the nostalgia of playing this great game on a mobile phone. The graphics are pretty good for the mobile version.. however 1 star less for the horrible controls.. the shooting and driving controls are very poor and it's very hard to shoot or chase a target... I hope Rockstar games improve the controls of this game. They should make it similar to pubgs controls.",
            "I played this first with a controller, had a great time although not really a fan of it for the buttons for interaction or answering the phone is not included, but when I played this on the touchscreen, the driving is fantastic, but the aiming and especially the first person sight is really weird and even though I enable auto aim in first person it doesnt auto aim"

            "Good, but not great. It mostly suffers from repetition you have basically 4 phases in a day, and do the same thing. Short terms are better to explore the different prisoners. Give us more to do would be cool. Haven't escaped yet, but I'm guessing it's game over if you do. Might be kinda fun to have an expansion to fight urges to not go back to prison or something.",
            "Used to play it a ton so its prolly cos of the nostalgia but good stuff. Bunch of stuff to do and bunch of characters. Ok humour too.",
            "Man, down loaded this game a couple years ago. ended up doing the personal goal of like 70 prisoners. Bought it again so I can start over, do all personal goals, and get all the achievements! absolute freaking ripper of a game. literally weeks of replayability, even longer if you don't get super hooked like me !!",
            "Real review, I love this game. I come back to it every few years or so. It is challenging in parts, but it really shows prison like scenarios.",
            "great I wish there was a number 2 or more games similar. I've conquered it with so many different prisoners"

            "This game is truly VNL Entertainment's magnum opus, the game that put them on the map in a way. The gameplay consists of various quests where you have to beat up people for rewards, whether it be crowds of easy to kill opponents or 1 beefy mini boss. Now, the combat.. it sort of works. Thats pretty much the best I can say about it, the dialogue is laughably dumb but that adds to the game's appeal along with the retro simplistic graphics. Fun game to play when you're bored.",
            "This game is pretty annoying because your stamina goes down fast and the bullies don't die unless you hit them like 100 times. This is a pretty bad game.",
            "It crashes on my device for some reason right after the bully takes the nerds books then in loading it crashes for no reason any way to fix this?",
            "Please fix this game!!! Ads don't work and makes it hard to play. Fix the controls too!! Answer me VNL Entertainment Games please!!! Please fix!!!!",
            "I've been playing this game for a very long time I've deleted it and downloaded it multiple times and I've been dealing with this bug to where you're supposed to be able to watch ads to get $500 because it's so hard to earn money on the game. but I just want the bug to be fixed other than that the game is a really great game! good job developers!!!"

            "I would give 1 star if not for points. They purposely make you have only 6 and 12 points awarded in the draw (always choose the same one and the probability of getting anything other than 6 and 12 is 0). Unlock system is confusing. Sometimes it unlocks 2 chapters with one payment other times it takes 2 chapters worth of coins for 1 chapter. Also coins are too expensive for the quality of books that are offered, most lacking proofreading and around half not even making any sense",
            "I really enjoy the stories. I have read a good bit of them. I would suggest a way to pay for a subscription other than per chapter it can become very expensive to finish a story, other than the cost and spell check the stories are great very deserving of my five stars.",
            "Takes 4-5 days to unlock and you get 1-2 chapters, no more than 6-10 pages. I read a story to chapter thirty one before I gave up. Each chapter costs 66 vouchers/coins to unlock. It is unnecessarily expensive and I would not sink real money into this app like I have with other reading apps. I hit before finishing the book.",
            "I can understand paying for a book but it \"costs\" too many vouchers for one book so you end up spending way more money than you should. After all ebooks are at most 10 dollars or less. Also some of the stories just jump around so you can't understand what is happening in the story anymore. I understand this is written by people and is used for them to get their books out there but there should be some kind of proof reading or editing before posting the book.",
            "The app charges money (payment gets confirmed) and you will receive no reading credits. This seems to be a common occurrence as the issue is outlined topmost in their tech support page. Have written to tech support with proof of transaction and have heard nothing back. All the 5 star ratings seem to be provided by readers who got offered free credits for a 5 star rating."

            "This is such, and STILL a great game. The reason for this is airplane mode. This gets rid of all ads an snakes gameplay less laggy. The huge selection of guns and weapons is pretty good. The bosses are nice, and everything in it is amazingly incredible. Overall I made this page to tell you to use airplane mode and get the creator more positive reviews. But still get rid of some ads. Thank you. 😉",
            "I love this game a lot but when I beaten the bosses in the first ten maps then relaunch the app when I come off it, some of the bosses reset for no reason and I have to keep beating them up again and again. These bosses that reset are on map three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. Can you fix this bug please. P. S. Thank you for changing all of the bosses into humans again.",
            "Its so sad that this game sold out. Used to be an amazing game. Now there are UNSKIPPABLE ADs everywhere. It was one of my favourite games, and is now awful to endure. When the option pops up to watch an add to \"double the reward\" whether you choose to double it or not you will STILL have to watch an add as it plays automatically regardless of the button you press. Some of these ads even have a function where they reroute you out of the app and straight to the googleplay download page. Awful",
            "The game was fun at first until it started lagging and glitching out on me. The screen goes black every five minutes and sometimes the boss will disappear from the screen completely making me restart the app. And if there's more than ten maps it won't let me scroll through the rest of them. It only shows maps 1 through 10."

            "The game is good but some stuff are confusing, I'm not talking about the storyline being confusing I'm talking about how a student costs 500 coins yet you only need 100 coins to buy land...what? Speaking about coins it's easy to get them however its way more easier to spend the coins I say GET THE GAME RIGHT NOW OR YOU'LL REGRET IT! I haven't been playing for long so I can't say anything much. But once I've played for a while, I'll come back and share my honest opinion. Thank You",
            "I love the game but it's kinda hard to do more things or stuff with lack of rings but all in all it's kinda not a problem. I'm really enjoying every second! My cousin tried to cheat and changed her date and time and she told me when she put it back on the right day and time again, she checked the game and found out that her parties and dates will be over in 7 days and 23 hours! 🤣🤣🤣Great job with that!",
            "The game is a great game but when the main focus is money it makes it very irritating to play. All the players you need to advance or do missions cost a gargantuan amount of rings, books, or coins. The amount of free rings and pencils for the mini game is so small in comparison it's like you didn't get anything for free at all.",
            "Ok so I love this game but the one thing that made me give it a four instead of a five star was the fact that its not letting me link my friend from Facebook nor Google, I hope that it will get fixed soon because I do love this game. Also I found its doing it to the other game Hollywood U too. Also if its not too much to ask can you do more updates on the game like for cirten holidays?",
            "This game was my absoulte favorite for about 7 months... Up until this morning, when my data was lost forever... I dont know why, i dont know how. So, sadly, i had to say a tearful goodbye just an hour ago. This game got me through quarantine... If there is any way i can get my data back, please let me know 😭"

            "The game glitched and cheated me on an important match . I clearly rolled a strike, the pin set came down to no pins yet only counted 9 pins and wanted me to roll another ball before it would carry on with the game. That would have greatly affected my score causing me to loose. I paused the game and tried to explain what happened but got no reply in over 2days. When I went back to see if anything was taken care of I unpaused the game to see myself rolling the ball that I hadn't played! Anybody??",
            "Don't Like how hard it's hard to pick up splits like especially the 7-10 Split. It like it's impossible to get a 7- 10 split. Maybe you are the only one that can get a 7-10 Split because my ball only hits one bowling pin and falls into the gutter. Even when I try to get a 7-10 split, it's hard to convert. All I can do is hit either the 7 pin or just the 10 pin. Well I did convert and earned a achievement which is the big 4 split.",
            "Beautiful game with absolutely horrible controls and mechanics. IT IS LITERALLY EASIER TO BOWL IN REAL LIFE! And that should never be the case with a game. Outrageously inconsistent results when rolling. Work on the controls and the rating easily goes up.",
            "I played other bowling games and they were too easy. Just bowl straight to get strike. The ball in this game behaves like a real ball with no way other than practice to get that nice roll. Others games the ball doesn't hook but this game you have the option of hooking the ball or not depending on how you touch the screen. It feels like being at the alley.",
            "Sensational my name does not appear on my profile and I am not treated like other players.why? would like to install if that problem is rectified.thank you I have a good name.why don't I show up on the screen bowling like other players???????okay love the new look.maybe you good add comment s player to player on the bowling rink????"

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

Its so helpful with parents. You can add everyone to your band and set things how you want them. They even have a live streaming option, polls, attendance and sooo much more. I will always use band for any group stuff I may have.",
            "I love the original Band App. It works so well from. My team at work and our daughters softball team to communicate with the parents. I recently downloaded the BAND FOR KIDS for my daughter to talk to her teammates, it hasn't worked yet. I have paid 2 different times, $.50 and I still can't make it work.",
            "Great app--has essentially transformed our group's communication. Feature request: Please allow toggling the visibility of calendars within a Band. If we have multiple calendars created for different purposes, it would be nice to be able to declutter the agenda view by hiding events from irrelevant calendars. Also, please let us specify an individual calendar (when there are multiple) from a specific band when we are creating a widget. Thank you, developers!",
            "This is a excellent app. I was able to listen enjoy and be a part of a church service that was active. Thank you Pastor Rodrick Reeve of New Creation family worship center. Also the staff and congregation. Love the way it works. I will tell others how good it is. Thanks.🤩",
            "Perhaps the best application to manage a sports team activities and keep everyone coordinated and on the same page. Same is true for the recording project, as it is a platform to have all the materials shared and updated between the participants."

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

This app is not bad, but is still able to have much more updates to it. The touch processing is also slower a bit making it seem laggy plus it only informs people what bullying does and not really how they can overcome it in reality. Overall, this app can be made better and I hope it will, the objective is definitely on spot, but the app just isn't.",
            "This app is decent, but it doesn't have any original information, it's just copied off a website. There's no point in downloading this app when you can just search up information about bullying in Google. Another thing is that, you need to pay to make a report. No one will pay to make a report about bullying when they can just make a call to the authorities themselves.",

Money is not something u really can ask for, do you think kids that don't report bullying to their parents would ask their parents for money and to do what? They'll ask and the kids would say, for an app that reports bullying cuz I'm getting bullied....... Makes sense right?",

            "Game is very greedy, but fun. Stingy, but fun. Hard to become good. Cost a fortune or a lifetime to get a competitive player. Season pass is very stingy. 6 months of playing and you still will be average in stats. Game is very fun. But I spent $16 and have played for months and I have a long way to go. Game is fun but the creators are the greediest Ive evr seen. Could be one of the best ever, but your kids will learn what being Robbed feels like! Enjoy",
            "The game is entertaining sure.. but the controls are absolutely horrible! Half the time, it doesn't respond well, especially during the goalkeeing.. therefore losing the match.. fix this issue. Edit: Forget about what I said about it being entertaining! It's not!! How can it be when the whole game is rigged at higher levels..",
            "THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! Do NOT get this game unless you want to be scammed out of coins you bought from your own money. I am barely on level 3 and im constantly going against players who are like level 20. Also whenever try to block a kick it keeps somehow going through my hands like im some kind of ghost. And, whenever i do the 400 coin game it charges me 500 COINS instead of 200! I do not reccomend this game.",
            "Addictive game but annoying as hell when you're put up against someone who's player has so much power in their shot it makes it nearly impossible to save. And when you play against someone on shooting race, sometimes your opponent resets for the next kick so much faster than you do (somehow) you cant win because they're 2 shots ahead of you!",
            "Paid $4.99 for VIP to 3rd Season Anniversary Cup yesterday. Game suddenly restarted in the final match. After restart, lost all VIP benefits. Later a Gold Cup was added to my account... Were is my VIP winner's green striped jersey and other winner's prizes? If you charge real money, test your product! The same issue happened before. That's why I didn't purchase anything extra for the game for a long time. Seems like nothing has changed on your side. That's sad."

            "I used to love playing this game. Unfortunately they have changed it too much. I remember I could spend 10 coins and get 10 balls. Now its 35 coins for 5 balls. Now I only get 5 lives and if I run out of lives my options are of course to pay or to wait. I play this game to relax and can play it for hours. Now with the new heart/life system I can't. I'm very frustrated and disappointed. I'm on level 1445 but don't know if I'll keep playing I appreciate you responding to my review but until I see",
            "This game was fun. However over the past several updates they made it more and more about the money than the players. The game itself is fun. It used to be unlimited lives, but now it's to a heart system. This way you have to pay or wait to pay. The piggy bank is awful. It's just another way for them to make money. The fact that you used to get 5 balls free for watching an ad was fair. Now for 5 balls you pay 35 coins. All signs point to the developers only caring about money.",
            "Another piggy bank cash grab. I am going to uninstall because I refuse to pay for my own progress. If it wasn't a cash grab, why can't you make it to where I can open the piggy bank by watching ads, just like it gives me the option of watching a video for extra moves? Seriously, come up with an idea of your own and maybe it would be better. What a waste of time",
            "My mom and I, love this game so much but the new heart system is so frustrating. This is the only game that she plays over and over again. Please consider getting the old system back is kinda hard to explain to her why her game needs to wait for a while to play again cause she's getting old.",
            "Used to love this game, but the recent changes have made it more frustrating than it's worth. The constant ads, pop ups prompting purchases between each level, the constant piggy bank pop up were a little annoying but still manageable. The last introduction of hearts/lives has made it not worth the play at all. I understand the desire to monetize things, but it was taken too far. I normally buy the full version of the apps I like, but don't see an option for that with this one."

            "It's a fun way to build your vocabulary.The negatives are: your opponent can take 4 or 5 days before playing their move which is frustrating but more frustrating is the amount of people who think it is an online dating game. Try to chat you up but as soon as you say you're not interested they then don't play the game leaving you having to wait for them to expire. You should be able to close the game without being penalised",
            "I love this game is it's a lot of fun, but there is a down side. Most of the guys that play, not all, most, all they want is chat dirty. This is a game to play and have fun not a dating site. And if you won't talk dirty with them they resign after a few plays. That's the down side. Luckily there are more people who just want to have fun. There needs to be a way to report the dirt.",
            "Although this game has some glitches, overall it's a great Scrabble experience that is fun to play. However, the most recent update has caused the game to crash immediately on the first or second loading screen. Occasionally it makes it to the main screen, whereupon it crashes as soon as I try to click on any of my ongoing Scrabble games in progress. Since it is now totally unusable, I have moved on. Hopefully the developers can fix it in the next version update.",
            "BEWARE ! Once you ask to play with one player from your contact list, your entire contact list will be visible. Asking them to remove your contact list and you get no where. I am still asking. I got a response but useless. Contact list still on here. I had to uninstall the game and reinstall under new gaming name, losing all my points that I bought BUT my contact list is gone.",
            "The game app is STILL freezing due to an \"ANR input dispatching timed out\" programming error. I send reports daily to the game programmer but still no fix in sight. NOT HAPPY. Previously - While I LOVE this game I am letting my opponents down by abandoning games due to all the loading freezes. At the very least, put a banner up telling ALL PLAYERS that some users are experiencing difficulties & game play has been interrupted. It's the right thing to do. Where is this promised update? UGH!"

            "Very few ads, and you can skip them anyway. Fun game, good time killer. If you like bowling games, grab this one. I've read other reviews of this app, and I disagree with most. I've read that the game would be better if you \"had more control of the ball\" or to \"have better English\" . HELLO!! you have TOTAL CONTROL of the ball!! You can almost do figure 8ts down the alley! Just use your finger to manipulate the ball, and you can get perfect games! I've bowled 3 straight strike perfect games!",
            "Clearly a lot of time and trouble went into this. The graphics and sounds are great. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel a bit like real bowling. When you're ready to throw, you can't swing the ball back to give it \"momentum\" or spin. You can't even pick it up—all you can do is slide it sideways on the ground. To throw, you must push it forward, like you're stepping over the foul line into the lane. Totally unnatural. I wonder if these developers have ever actually bowled in real life? 🤷‍♂️",
            "Better than many I have tried, however it would be a 5 star app if the players had more control over the English on the ball. I prefer to control ball speed rather than not knowing . Also being able to set the curve or hook would be nice. There are a few balls that don't roll true as they roll over the finger holes and bounce.",
            "This used to be a 5 star game but whatever the programer did has turned it into a 1 star game. It used to be very stable & fun to play now it is extremely unstable. It locks up, freezes, does not respond & quits without warning. I'm using a Nokia CS2 Tava w/OS 10 & ever since I started playing it on this phone I've had nothing but trouble w/it. Even when I swipe the ball to roll it just stands there then all of a sudden the ball will roll on its own. As the saying goes if it works don't fix it",
            "Just keep on going. The longer you play the more entertaining it becomes! ADDED: In my mind this game is perfect. Might be a little too easy for experienced bowlers but well suited for beginners like me."

            "This game used to be halfway decent, but that was before they started to put ads into every time that you go to sleep or you get caught doing something \"wrong\" which is about every two minutes pretty much(oh, and the ad's unskippable too, lmao). Also, they got rid of the character customization at the start, and now you have to buy every single thing. Screw you MDickie, and I was just starting to think that you were one of the good ones.",
            "This game is the best MCDICKY game period. I have played countless hours and have paid hundreds of dollars to gain respect on prison grounds. The in-depth graphics are simply astonishing. The storyline is like a mixture between every steven spielberg movie created. This game amazes me, blows my mind. The content I experienced in this was better than I would of a Leon Lush video, and that's saying something. Also I genuinely dislike anyone who hates this game, ANYONE.",
            "Great little game my partner and I paid the 2.99 to get rid of the adds, but there seems to be a glitch were you character seems to get take over and there is nothing you can do but wait till you get control again, please fix. Other than that great game.",
            "the controls are simple but difficult but the game is great and i like how the fighting is hardcore and one hit can decide the hole thing but if you add in an option to what items appear in the prision it might make the game more reallistic but i love the way the game is in its own kind of universe lol Also it would be cool to have more experience with the gangs and have them be a bigger impact on how things go for you. And last about the update, why take away from the experience and put more ad",
            "This game used to be halfway decent, but before they started to put aids into every time you go to sleep or you get caught doing something ''wrong'' and the frame is so slow. Once you had the thousand money, your life would be at risk. Wardens are attacking you for no reasons."

            "My favorite game right now. It's a fun game, almost like a rythem push buttons to do things game. The only reason I didn't give this game five stars is because of the probability upgrade system. It seemed out of wack. One of the upgrades was at a \"95%\" but fail 9 times before succeeding. That doesn't make any sense. Other than that, I really enjoy this game!",
            "Well, the concept is quite good, test your reaction and speed. Enjoying it so far. For now, the only issue I have encountered is that the forth guy hides with his left shoulder and arm, the upcomings from the right and how many times you need to either dodge or punch. If I encounter more, I will update you. Maybe you might consider the idea of adding a customization clothing that benefits your upgrades/character for example, or just a customazible appearance and to unlock it you need to pass certain challenges or you can pay in-game currency to skip those challenges. The art style, what can I say, I love pixel art, or just 8bit art style, reminds me of the old times. On terms of gameplay I feel it intuitive, I get a little bit of fuzzed later on because I start to mix up or miss a dodge/punch, maybe you can add to customize in options to change that interface's colour. I hope you don't need to add microtransactions for progression, that would be plain stupid and would ruin the experience. Furthermore, hoping for new content and updates, keep it up devs!",
            "Fun game simple to pick up difficult to master, Ive made to the second to last boss in the challange mode. I've realised you lose health every millisecond when u arent pressing the buttons fast enough (like crack fast). I found this really annoying and a hinder to the joyment of this game. You guys should look into that and make it so you only lose health when actually mess something up, or a if you dont press the attack button in 0.85 seconds than you lose health. Other then that ive had fun.",
            "It's a really good game and it's fun and addicting to play but I don't like how your health runs out when your fighting if your to slow and how when practicing if you miss one you'll have to start over. I also think they should add dodging to the practice part of the game so you won't be prepared to just punch in the actual fights.",
            "Short, simple, and to the point. You tap and punch. It's One Finger Death Punch meets Punch Out!!! It's nothing short of a blast if that sounds like it's your cup of tea. I've personally got to Level 6 in the Challenge Mode and haven't regretted this game yet. If you're looking for a good arcade game for your smartphone this is a very good choice."

So I have to log off for an hour or so for it to fix itself, could anyone look into the problem please? When everything's working I love the game it's addictive, just this issue that's ruining the fun.",
            "This game is garbage. Its a pay to win game if I've ever seen one. To get anywhere in this game you either need to be level 100, or spend lots of gold... Which brings me to this. At first I enjoyed occasionally playing this. However, they have removed the \"watch ads for 2 free gold\" along with the free online offers! Completely screwing the gamers that are smart enough not to waste a penny on this",
            "This game is now unplayable on a Samsung S8. The game will not load past 95% and I've waited over 30 minutes unsuccessfully. Before this flub, it was not possible to buy/place buildings for months, due to a software bug that was never addressed. It seems this app is just in disrepair and only made worse each time it's updated.",

            "First of all, there are just so many damn ads. You have to see a whole lot of em. Like you get an ad after every match. Secondly, there is certain network issues with some specific opponents only. I mean like it's all going good then suddenly an opponent and it gets network and they just win it, especially if you are playing a tournament. That's really frustrating.",
            "Yet another great game ruined by greed! To the Dev...you know those adverts that keep popping up? Nobody watches them, nobody clicks on them, nobody cares about them because they are irrelevant and so out of touch. Also, why are we limited to playing only 5-6 games before we have to pay money to refill? Absolute D**k move. So why don't you just make a €2.99 one off payment option and let us enjoy your god damn game!!! I'll even put money on the fact that you won't even respond to my review 🤫",
            "This game is such a pay-to-win! It comes up to three things: pay for diamonds, buy powerups, and win matches swiftly. You can be 5 scores ahead of another player and suddenly lose the match because your opponent uses their powrups to win the game in 20 seconds! You can even pay for bigger and faster characters! The game itself was so good if both players had equal abilities in every match.",
            "Greed has ruined the game, thanks developer. This game is actually fun and exciting but there are ads after every match. It's very annoying. If you love to watch ads every 1.5 minutes of game play, you need to have this game! There are countless of \"crazy special deals\" that you can purchase at \"up to 90% off\". Just so many ways that entice players to spend spend spend!",
            "The game is getting ridicules! I believe when one click search, the game should automatically put an opponent of the same level of power! Not a ridiculously super powered opponent who you don't stand a chance against! I'm not enjoying this game any more. This issue should be fixed. Here I am writing you new update. I thought you guys have take into consideration your the reviews of your users and fixed the issue which everyone is complaining about! You guys suck. big time."

            "I was excited when I read the description of this app. I downloaded it and went through the set up steps. At the very end it wanted my payment info. No free trial to see if I liked the app before I had to give my payment info or pay. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I am uninstalling this app",
            "its very useful! It doesnt tell you exactly what your child is doing on their phone but it does give you a great broad ovetview of screentime, most used apps and alerts for the out of ordinary events like being on the phone in the middle of the night. It is not a \"spy\" app so if you want something more specific, this may not be for you. However, if youre looking for a screening tool to just keep an eye on the type of usage then I highly recommend it!",
            "This app has been great. I love that it send messages strait to my phone wuth the information i want and need. It allows me to keep an eye on what they do without having to spend hours searching threw their phones. Kids are smart enough to delete stuff and this app tells you when they do and saves me so much time and worry. I love this app.",
            "I like this app, it does what it says kind of. I don't get notices about what my daughter is doing but I can scan her phone. I would like to see an option where both parents can monitor one child. I also have an inactive child account that I can't delete. That would be helpful. My favorite thing is all the negative reviews from kids. It's wild!",
            "Beautifully designed solution to a very important problem. I'm a \"free range\" parent, and I love the fact that I can get insight into what my son is experiencing online while still respecting their right to privacy. I don't understand why some commenters are saying the app invades kids' privacy. They obviously haven't used it. This is no more an invasion of privacy than e.g. asking a teacher how my kid behaves at school."

            "Been playing this game for a couple of months now and still enjoying it. Ads are very short and do not interrupt gameplay. You can also opt for the ad free version. I personally especially like the challenge levels and the opportunity to watch full ads in order to earn rotations which can be saved and help loads if there are no suitable spaces left. A great game. No complaints at all 🏆",
            "Love the game! However, to earn extra rotators you have to watch commercials. Sometimes many many commercials. The commercials are redundant. Based on your online searches, the commercials are geared to your interests. But if you enjoy watching American Girl 5 maybe 10 times in a row, this might be the game for you. They also offer different wood block games and show you those commercials over and over and over again. You would think if they would be a little creative.",
            "Great gamec- I initially liked this game. At first you could get a free rotator every 5 minutes plus a 30 second ad. Now I have to wait for a free rotator every 24 hours. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. I am part of a group of people who download games, test them, and grade them and pass our comments to them who then pass the recommendations on to everybody in the group and then we pass them on to our friends and family. I do not recommend this game in any way whatsoever.",
            "I Love Puzzles!!! Been playing this game for about a year or so and it's always fun and challenging. I enjoy a challenge with games like this! I will continue playing it. Happy to see the feature added of being able to rotate the piece to fit where you want it. Cool! Thanks!! Continue with enhancing the app to be even greater! 🙂",
            "Rubbish app, spent more time restarting app than playing it. The first few days it was fine but as I ran out of rotates I watched a couple of ad's, to get some more, the app never worked correctly after that. It just kept freezing up. Was fun to play but since there are several versions I might try another block game"

Not Cool, INTERUPTING MY GAME PLAY TO SHOW AN AD AND THEN CHANGING MY POSITION ON THAT BOARD TO MAKE ME LOSE THE BOARD WHEN I WAS 2 MOVES FROM WINNING?!?! Well, THAT gets you UNINSTALLED! If you're considering downloading this, PLEASE BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, some are just being KIND! This is the WORST I've ever seen. There are other games like it, try one of them & avoid this LOOSER! UNINSTALLING!!!! NOTHING BUT GREED!",
            "Love this game. I see people complaining about the ads, but I really haven't experienced this. I know an ad pops up each time you lose a level and have to restart, but if you're smart, you can avoid actually \"losing\" any level. I'm not going to divulge this trick since it would interfere with their ability to make money, but come on people. Even if you do have to watch an ad between attempts or levels, it's a free game with THOUSANDS of free levels. Calm down.",
            "(ed) 10/27/20... still enjoy playing will leave rating as is unless issues are not resolved. Last 2 weeks off & on unable to watch ad to cont., with level which is an uninstall issue. Lost a level & had to repeat but I think fluke. 1rst issue not fluke. Have put a little $ in for extra balls & to say thanks. Hope to continue playing// Its addicting and I enjoy it. Ads are short and are really good. Tried several games from the ads.",
            "This game would be great comic it doesn't give me a stupid commercial every single time I pause like other games have done, it gives reasonable commercials reasonable times… but it breaks down. I have tried to undo a move twice in the last couple of days, and not only does it take away the gems I ever earned, but it doesn't undo the move, moves the blocks down and completely screws up the game even more. Extremely frustrating. Other than that, though, it's a great game.",
            "The game is simple easy and better than any other. The ads aren't too Terrible, you can close them out instantly when you get an ad to go to the next level or forfeit the level, if you want the free rewards, you'll get an ad the you have to watch in full, but that's understandable. I highly recommend, and I've had this game for over a year and a half. It saves data if you create an account which has proved incredibly reliable since I've had to get multiple new phones. Great game."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes.

            "This irresponsible app has a misunderstood and totally unnecessary \"feature\" of anonymity (I guess because it was much easier to not implement any authentication/ID system) which makes it, ironically, the perfect tool for cyber harassing and cyber bullying. There is absolutely no deterrent to submitting false reports and getting fellow students in trouble if you're a bad kid in a school system who adopted this Sprigeo system. While bullying can be a real problem in some schools, this is the wrong way to go about it. Just look at the top reviewer bragging about getting so many people in trouble using this app. Anonymity is what empowers the worst internet trolls and harassers. The bullying report in this app is not going to be seen by your peers, but only by authorized school staff, so anonymity in this app is not a feature but just a terrible flaw to exploit here by the trolls/bullies in your school.",

            "This used to be my favorite game, now I downloaded it again and I'm just disappointed, there is no story mode, you can only go a limit in every round till you finish the mission , and where did the story's go , and the record breaking games, and what happend to competitions, and the super silly fun land with the rollercoaster, I'm just disappointed, I hope you can fix it and undo the last 10 updates, and go back to the original game, cuz this one sucks. Very sadly uninstalling.🥺😩",
            "Game is enjoyable but once you complete all the levels you can't progress further. Also there should be a proper character categorisation . There are only 3 types of characters; common ,rare and epic. But some characters can be found by special missions . So they should be categorised under legendary or exclusive . Further there should be new rooms and new powerups for minions.",
            "I have given up trying to play it. 5 updates later and still no resolution to my loading issues, and I see from other comments I am not alone. Shame as otherwise it was for me one of the best games. Edit: thank you for your answer but it still doesn't work. Not sure of my Player ID as I can't get into the game, after the initial video it gets stuck on downloading 0mb of 0mb 🤷🏽",
            "great game but wow ive had problems. they have this new update and now i cant play anymore it just says downloading. for a week. i contacted help got a ticket but no fix. and then years ago i played this spent a ton of money but my progress wasnt saved. now it says i should be able to get my current progress back thru fb but i have my doubts since I cant even get into the game at all. so great game but dont play. edit: weeks later and still nothing from help customer assistance. Edit: better now",
            "Honestly, im rating this game 4 stars, all the progress i made in the good ole days of Minion Rush in the Story Mode was lost, and i genuinly miss that satisfaction of passing levels and seeing that a new part of the lab gets made and unlocked by filling up the containers with jelly, honestly, its easier to get minions now compared to before and currency is WAY easier to obtain compared to before, all that its missing for me is that story mode it had before, but still, this is a great game!"

            "I've been playing this game for a while and I'm really enjoying myself; but my problem is that once you reach Misty Peaks, your ability to earn enough money to progress pretty much stops. I've reset several times and always get stuck at misty peaks. The fish are barely worth anything, the cost to go to the next level is a huge jump from the last price, and the price to level up your boat (to level 15) is totally insane. I want to keep playing but it's frustrating to not be able to advance.",
            "Love the game but it seems like a con! I paid 0.79p for gems. Spent 264 gems on a crew member and when I returned later, the crew member had gone and went back to being locked but my gems had gone. Won't be spending another penny on this. I've also noticed that I upgrade my boat and when I come back, the boat has gone back to the previous tier but my money i spent on the boat has gone. Absolutely terrible",
            "Pretty good game. Nice time waster with some good built-in rewards and fair progression. There doesn't seem to be any way to circumvent ads in the game, as there is no visible \"remove ads\" purchase option, and a lot of the more enjoyable rewards are hidden behind watching ads or making purchases. This is ultimately going to make me stop playing at some point, but the game itself is well crafted, so 4 stars.",
            "It's ok. Could be way better. There is absolutely no way to gain experience for being offline. Making it hard to progresses unless you leave the game on constantly. This is a typical make is as far as you can then reset game. The experience is what you get when you reset, but you don't really earn while offline. Make the game more offline friendly. This is why other games are successful",
            "(Check edit history, ran out of space.) Along with all of that, the ads truely are everywhere. Open the game after saving? Full screen, unskippable casino ad. Get past that? Double up by watching another ad. Finally get into the game? Checked your item box and lost 60 gems because the \"open with gems\" button is big and right in the middle of your screen? Looks like you have to watch some ads to get those back. Not even going to mention the wheel. Thats just made for ad watching, being rigged."

AND I've been on level 549 and WHY do i need to finish upto level 630 just to unlock the next room? it becomes boring and tiring ! I'm 👌 this close to uninstall it though I'm addicted to it and the designs are great! it becomes more boring and boring !!!!!!!😢",
            "It is ok but I don't like the way you have to do a puzzle as without them you would be able to enjoy the game more. Some people do like puzzles but there should be a choice button. Also we should press on things and change it without doing puzzles not just the first few.",
            "This was actually enjoyable (too many stuffed animals for it to feel like you were designing for real), but the thing that kills it is non-consensual ads. It would be very easy for them to up the bonuses that you get for watching ads, but they decided not to go that way.",
            "Fun game. I gave four instead of five stars only because it glitches too much on my tablet. I finished the kitchen and now it won't connect to server. Darn. I really enjoy the game play.",
            "I Really Like The Game. But I would change a couple of things. I would like to be able to decline picking some furniture. I don't like rugs and paintings. We picked beautiful flooring and walls and then have to cover them up. Also sometimes we pick a color scheme such as pink or lavender and then a furnishing is not the same colors. Maybe a choice of the color scheme at the beginning with the cleaning etc"

The power meter is a hit or miss-it doesn't shoot when you intend to and you then have to pull it again which then messes up the direction of your shot (half your time has gone by then). There are too many cheaters. Too many players abusing the connection function to waste time in the game. 8 Ball Pool Popups every few seconds are annoying.",
            "Was having a good entertaining experience, when all of a sudden don't know for what reason all my progress just vanished. Tried to reach the developers but they have not responded till yet. My level which was 41suddenly backed to 5. All my winnings were gone. Was expecting a prompt help for the same. But it seems the developers are no more intrested in good reviews. I am really disappointed.",
            "Love 8 ball pool !!! I loved the pool pass ,but couldn't afford to buy anything. But love playing for it. It's been updated a lot to improve it . That's a plus!!! I love 8 ball and 9 ball, but like others on here , some of the things happening are unbelievable, balls just hanging on the edge , the cue moving when it was aimed to shoot, and coins disappearing!!! And other players stealing your turn, and your coins. Please fix this stuff happening. A true patriot of 8 Ball Pool. Love it !!!",
            "The game was good when I started playing it but now that I've progressed it's like your playing a robot, perfect shot, perfect english on the ball, every shot just perfect. Don't waste your money buying coins trying to advance quicker it doesn't help, you'll only lose them quicker and have to buy more. The weekend games are usually won by the same people if you watch the standings. A perfect bank shot will run off course like the table isn't level, did it today!!",
            "Constantly hangs up. After an update the program became worse. It only allows me 2 seconds to play and then switches players. It does not record a ball made. It replayed the same player when i chose not to. It never allowed me to play, it hanged up for 3 minutes and it ended the game and the other player won. I'm ready to abandon this game. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!"

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",

            "I truly appreciate how much work has been put into this game.(Edit)After reinstalling the game after some months I am dissapointed. First off as a fan/oldplayer of school of chaos this merge has ruined our game. I like coc because it is its own different game. But we do not have soc anymore, to put it simply, we have coc. We really miss soc and I think for every old player you should put soc back on the playstore as a diffrent name. This is because everything we liked about soc has been taken!😭",
            "Bring back OS! OS has been the main combat system for years, and y'all just removed it for this dookie ass spammable Rage system. I wanna have a fun fight, a race for who's Rage meter fills up first. Also, remove Don't Move!, Armor Breaker, and Bounce. Those Rages are the dumbest things I ever heard, you don't even need skill to learn how to use them or break their armor because Armor Breaker does it all for you.",
            "this game is the best! its so fun and i always die in hallways :| its so fun its more like SoC. but i have and issue here its some just wrird glitches and its not lag -_- im serious that there is a glitch and nice fame there VNL i only dont like the SoC. best game dowbload it right now!",
            "Really goooooood game , this new update was reallly nice but there are somthings wrong : please add tp to city and school in next update because thats really hard when players want to go to city or school and its have too mutch long way and developes can add set spawn point too ... i wish these are and somethings like swiming , cars and ex.. in next update ,vnl thank you for create the best rpg game thanks",
            "It's a Fun game Just Here To Report About A Bug. The Glitch Is You Can't Do Rage If You Are On Or Recently On A Scooter. Every Time That Happens I Think About How I Wasted My VIPs On Rage Just To Figure Out It Dosent Work Plz Fix This I Like My Scooter And I Don't Want To Sell It Again Like My Old Scooter"

Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. 😍😇😁😁",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Always getting the response \"okay syncing devices for [names], sorry 3 things aren't available right now, you might want to try setting them up again.\" Trying setting them up again doesn't solve anything. Next up: We are quite invested in the Google ecosystem. But what I don't get is the nonexisting Android TV integration... How is this going to be solved?",

Movie apps work fine, but suddenly I cannot play music, even though I have changed nothing in my settings and Spotify is set as the default player in Google Home. Settings are unintuitive and confusing, and each specific option is so difficult to find that it might take hours of exploring before you find what you're looking for. Please fix this as soon as possible.",

Multiple problems with streaming. Max tells me I need to link my account even though I have done that. It asks me what I want to play my video on even though I have set the HubMax as my default display. I could keep going with problems that I have googled for help, gone to you tube for help, but can't get resolved. The app needs an upgrade!",

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 🌟 is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

            "This app is horrible, avoid it like the plague. I know they meant good but it is a mess will just waste your MBs. 1) I can't find or access my sites.it just asks me to create a new one. 2) Takes ages to just load the help page. 3) Their solution to fixing the problem is them just telling you that you logged in with the wrong email address. I think adding an \"Import/Re-import your site(s)\" button would be a better solution.",
            "This app is terrible... it takes an hour to add 1 product. Maybe. The amount of time I waste taking photos, retaking photos, upload failed repeatedly, close app, start over, etc. Is infuriating!!! As a small maker business, I have a ton of one of a kind items I just cannot list. Because I cannot get them listed! Most of my stuff is on etsy because I don't have any other choice. And to top it all off, I have to start my listings at the computer then try to upload the photos on my phone.",
            "It's a little intimidating at first to start, but once you begin toggling with the settings and features it starts to slowly form. I honestly should watch some tips and tricks videos to see how to make my website just how I want it. I honestly have been trying to get a friend to get interested in me, but no takers yet! I have used Wix programming since 2010 for high school studio art.",
            "Started using WIX to build websites using a computer because the online website builder is one of the best I've come across. But as many of our club members only use a smartphone, not a computer, I thought the WIX mobile app would make life easier. NOT SO! When a member builds his profile on a computer, it automatically shows up on the app version. But not the other way around. If you add a photo to your profile on the app, it doesn't appear on the website version. This needs fixing!"

            "Was a great game until the developers doubled the ad content. Not only that, but now the game is freezing after I make my final move to win the level, especially if I use a rainbow ball. If I use a rainbow ball in conjunction with another booster, regardless of what part of the level I'm at, the game freaks out and closes. When it does this, I have to redo the level again. If this continues, I will uninstall and reflect this in an update.",
            "I like this game because it is very relaxing. I also love the choices it gives you to work with. I personally love modern i think it is a cozy and cute inviorment to live in. I also love the matching game it gives you a way to get money. It is like a win win because you get to design and you get to match and overall i think this game is very good and that is why i gave it a five and if i had one complant it would be for a little bit more choices for the fashion sence. I will have my friends play",
            "Stupid & FULL OF ADS. Initially it was pretty good with not many ads. Now it's gotten so bad that there's not just 1 30+ second ad after every game, but 2 or even 3! It is beyond ridiculous how many ads you're forced to sit through in this game. On another note, it annoys me how the characters have been portrayed. The man looks strong and composed, hands folded across his chest. The woman, meanwhile, always has her mouth open, head bobbing, eyes squinting, looking like a silly child-like bimbo.",
            "I like this game because its direct. I mean other renovating games they ask us to earn stars to complete tasks. And those tasks include stupid ones like call a person, look under the bed, etc. But this only involves renovating and nothing else. No wasting time in listening to the people talking. I hate matching games but I'm putting up with it just because o this game is direct. I simply want a renovating game which doesn't have matching games, which doesn't have any stupid tasks and less talk",
            "I like this game because its quick. The graphics are good (not tiny little triangles squares and circles) Also you don't have to play loads of games to get furniture. The prices are pretty reasonable.so you get through rooms quicker"

            "Sicko app for beginners in the game. It keeps getting better too. Its not too complicated, if i wanted to do it in the studio, I would. I'd have to pay thousands of dollars too! Squash that, this is that new normal, that next paradigm. So let me drop a dime, in the phone(cellular). I made this song in one night, during a fight, between me and my wife. I didn't have any time, but it came out sublime, wife'ys calling it a crime, gold it glows, but silver it shines, 9 times. Outta ten..zen",
            "This app rewards people for copying and singing over other artists vocals. It also rewards the same 10 - 15 people every week. Admin don't reply to queries and they also don't stick to the rules. The same rules they expect their users to stick to. If you make your own cover art and mix your own tracks Its like you're less likely to be rewarded. They also judge tracks even tho they don't make music which means they don't even know what it takes to make tracks.",
            "Not bad! I like the concept of the app and it's pretty dope. Wish there were more functions. I've been waiting to relaunch my YouTube channel and music too so this was a pretty good idea to start networking. Try it out. They have samples and demos and easy to use",
            "I love this app but right now its giving me a hard time trying to use special features like I usually would it does not even let me see the words at the bottom to apply it... whats going on with the app??? And yes I am a Suscribed member for the year.",
            "The app is decent, still room for improvement though. How about adding a info bar so the producers can give details about the song structure, bpm, and instrumental etc? I have been wanting to write songs for the longest, but without that info i cannot do it."

            "So... I am a new android user and I just didn't like how the alarm app for my phone works. So I downloaded this Alarmy app and have been using it for 100 days now. It's super simple and easy to use and you can totally depend on it. I really like the mission associated to the alarms. Initially I chose the \"shake\" option and it really helped me get up. I know setting an alarm is a simple thing but alarmy makes this experience a tad bit better. I love the messages at the time of exiting the app.",
            "No muss no fuss. Set the alarm for your preference and you are done. Not a lot of useless suggestions. You can set it easily as a recurring alarm for meds etc. Even as a quick alarm (reminder). I previously downloaded 8 different reminders, alarms and deleted them all after trying each for a day. LOVE this one. Caveat: I have been using for a few days now. I don't mind the ads as much as having them among my alarm settings and unable to close or delete them.",
            "EDIT: Bug fixed, app is now working without ads and in app upgrade prompt. Premium features available with Play Pass. Star rating updated... From 10/21 Subscribed to Play Pass just to have this app with \"No ads or in app purchases\" as promised in the description. Complete falsehood. I even deleted and re-installed the app. While there were no 3rd party ads at first, there were still in app ads asking to upgrade to premium, which would be an in app purchase. Now the 3rd party ads are back too.",
            "Hello, I love this app so much as this is the only alarm that can wake me up, I can say that this is very useful for me especially for classes, I have to wake up early. But the problem is that, this app works totally fine to my old phone even if it's on silent mode but when I switched to my new phone, I can't even hear it alarming, can you help me with that please?",
            "This app stopped working and the alarm did not go off. That is unacceptable. I need an alarm that works 100% of the time not only 90% of the time. I updated my program and I am going to give this app 1 more chance. I think it is more a problem with my galaxy S8 phone than app."

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "I used to play this game years ago. I downloaded it again because I thought that it may have been updated by now... I was SADLY mistaken. i fact it seems more glitchy than I remember. The controls are TERRIBLE, and the game keeps crashing and won't open back up. I really like this game but its very frustarting to play with these issues. Please fix this !",
            "Its an amazing game, but there are some lags, like stars dissapearing after I close the game, and some crashes and freezes, but I love the game. Highly recommended! Edit: So I uninstalled the game for more space, and when I was done I installed it again, but even though I logged in with both Google Play Games and Facebook, my data was lost. So until this problem is fixed, I'm rating it 3 stars.",
            "Great graphics, controls, and game play. But like a lot of other people I think it's needs a plot of some kind because we need more than just some little quests. I also want you to add the state of Nevada as a location. And please make it easier to get sheriff stars or at least lower the prices. Overall great game but I think you can make it greater. If you do add a plot try to make it about the player that's trying to take down a antagonist who's trying to spread darkness throughout the West.",
            "Awful, glitches all the time, wont let me do multiplayer, saying I'm not connected to Internet, randomly closes, and worst of all I'm stuck in one position, can't move at all, its really bad considering how big gameloft is, don't waste your time on this garbage",
            "The last time I played this game was when I was little. I came back to download the game, and I cant open it. I had to check the last time it was made, and it was JANUARY. Please update your game. It seems that Gameloft just cares about asphalt, which is a good game but you have a lot of other games that are a fail due to laziness."

            "Bubble pop games are all different , but this game is special. Well though out colorful , much action , the baby dragon's and the game host are adorable . Many hours of points and enjoyment for all who participated in this game .",
            "THE best \"bubble pop\" I've played so far (about 10 which have been uninstalled). It's actually challenging at the higher levels and it took me 5 tries to get 5 stars just on level 20! Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",
            "The last 2 updates by developer were the same old version till level 665 and nothing beyond. Why released those useless updates then ?",
            "Love the game just wish I could land on the jackpot. Also I'm at level 525 and waiting for an update. Wow since I wrote this review I lost 550 coins and haven't even played since I'm waiting on the new update. I'm at level 645 and waiting for a new update to the app."

Bob goes forward and goes out of the screen means view. And without seeing how can one control? At first i couldn't believe but as i played number of times it was clear.",

            "Dino rampage is an amazing game. It has lovely features. Very nice game. It working very well. I like it very much",
            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

The graphics are stunning but the real joy comes from the gameplay, oh man the joy that can come from solving the \"Write a report\" puzzle, it's incredibly confusing because the game never tells you what actually qualifies as a death threat, so it was really challenging.

Does it give some the voices to speak up, yes, but it also increases fear in the minds of students. The fear of messing up can take over ones mind small things that don't really matter. This app is a good way to speak up but it can just as easily be used to spread hate or push someone over the edge. This is a step to fixing a problem but one that needs much improvement.",
            "I think the app has a wonderful purpose and purely good intent behind it--I'm a 16 year old that has endured hell itself with peers. While I love the message and meaning of it, my school is so small I'm rendered unable to use it; as everyone knows everyone, and though it is anonymous someone some way or another will find out and my a$$ will promptly be kicked. The bad reviews are truly pointless to me. Before you trash talk it: think about the meaning of it. Its intent is solely to help you."

            "This game is really fun I have been playing it for a while and I love it. You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwU🥰🤩",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

And while the app *is* in English, it's obvious that it was originally written in a different language and run through a translator since the sentence structure is often grossly incorrect. I've seen much better apps, and I've seen far, FAR worse apps than this one. Overall, I have to say it's an average application.",

First off, I thought this was a game for some reason and was surprised to find it's only a sort of \"comeback\" rollodex where there's the setup insult and then a few different comebacks to the initial insult. Both the insults and the comebacks are laughably bad and I can only imagine them being used in 4th grade. If you need to say that perfect comeback to the 10 year old next door then I suggest you download this app, otherwise, I suggest you move on with your life and spare any storage space on your device.",
            "Okay you only get 3/5 for these reasons. To get the other have of the juicy content, I have to rate you 5/5 for, (Which I did, and a lot of games have a bad habit of this) but I never received it. This application is actually really fun and will give you a good laugh. It would be 4/5 if it had more content, and 5/5 if users could submit juicy and snappy comebacks. This application will waste a nice 25mins off of your life and that it, just screen shot the content you like and save the space."

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "Bowling for those who love wasting time. Ball never follows path shown by planning roll highlighter. Screen jumps around so guaranteed numerous gutter balls everytime. Graphics are great, but if controls don't work, sorry, I am on to a game that entertainment is possible.",
            "Love this, 3D Bowling game. I am addictive. Best Bowling game, l ever played. 😍☺😃🤗😊😚 Thank you for, the best bowling game ever.",
            "The ball does not react as it should. There is no way the ball can go between 3 &6 take out 9 and no other pin. It happens a lot. There is no way the ball can take out the 3 and the 9 and not touch the other pins. Happens a lot.. Going to play a few more times then I've had it!!!! Well it seems no one is reviewing these ratings or just doesn't care so I'm uninstalling this game",
            "If would be nice to be able to see the score card at the end of the game.",
            "This is the best bowling game out there. I have tried others and there is no doubt Bowling 3D is by far the most interactive of them all. The others lacked any kind of challenge."
