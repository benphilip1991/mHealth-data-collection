            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

I feel very lucky, more optimistic creating daily habit of journaling with premium features.. Really love the visuals, simple yet elegant and artistic.. Keep up the good work! I hope I don't have any issues about data backup..",
            "I just downloaded the app and its really good, i really like how you can write all your thoughts and feelings. However, there are some negative things about this app. I wanted to add a passcode to the app so that no one can see all my thoughts and diaries, but it said that i had to pay. I don't think that is fair because i dont have the money to pay and it could be thesame for many other people and keeping your thoughts private on this app should be for free. Other than that, the app is good.",

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

Refreshing, and grateful that I stumbled across TalkLife. Keep it secret, keep it safe. ;)",

        "description": "Make self-care a priority with the InnerHour app\r\n\r\nDo you want to overcome depression? Beat anxiety? Tackle stress? Or simply feel happier?\r\n\r\nThe InnerHour app is here to help!\r\n\r\nUsing their insights from therapy and the latest science in CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy), Positive Psychology, and Mindfulness, our team of psychiatrists and psychologists have replicated the real-life therapy experience into a self-help app for you.\r\n\r\nThe app is your safe space for self-care, with 300+ therapy-based self-help tools designed for depression, anxiety, stress and other mental health concerns.\r\n\r\n▌Six self-help courses\r\n\r\n• Depression: Make small changes to overcome depression\r\n• Anxiety: Attain calm with strategies for anxiety relief\r\n• Sleep: Build a sleep schedule and develop habits to sleep better\r\n• Stress: Keep a check on your stress levels to feel in control\r\n• Anger: Channelise your anger and build learn strategies to cool down\r\n• Happiness: Develop critical skills to feel happier in life\r\n\r\n\r\n▌Personalised 4-week plans\r\n\r\nWith the help of a scientific assessment, the app will identify your unique mental health needs and build a personalised self-care plan for depression, anxiety, stress & more.\r\n\r\nSo what does your plan entail?\r\n\r\n1. Self-care activities\r\n\r\nWe have condensed decades of therapy experience and mental health research into simple activities - each teaching a strategy based on CBT, Positive Psychology, or Mindfulness. All you need is 5 minutes each day to work on yourself!\r\n\r\n2. Goal setting and tracking\r\n\r\nOur goal setting and tracking mechanism will help you build healthy habits that will last a lifetime. With this CBT-inspired feature, stay motivated to meet your physical and mental health goals - be it healthy eating,  exercising or thinking positively.\r\n\r\n3. Mood tracking\r\n\r\nCheck-in with yourself with our specialised tracker! The more you track, the more insights you will get. You can even identify specific emotions and map your mood to different activities you engage in throughout the day.\r\n\r\n4. InnerHour Resources\r\n\r\nWe want you to keep learning on your self-help journey. Our resources include articles, tips, and inspiring quotes to help you stay motivated. For instance, you will:\r\n\r\n• Understand the different causes of depression\r\n• Learn about the symptoms of anxiety\r\n• Know how to tell if it’s time to go to therapy\r\n\r\nYour self-help plan is a reflection of what happens in real life therapy. Over 4 weeks, we hope to help you practise skills to battle depression, sleep better, get anxiety relief, and ultimately lead an emotionally healthy life.\r\n\r\nYour self-care journey doesn’t have to end here…\r\n\r\n• Access additional self-help courses\r\n\r\nWe’ve built shorter courses to offer support for more specific concerns like overthinking, social anxiety, loneliness & more. Just like in therapy, you can work on these specific areas in addition to your main plan.\r\n\r\n• Feel less alone with Allie\r\n\r\nIn times of distress, talk to Allie, our intelligent chatbot. Allie identifies your mental health difficulty at the moment - be it anxiety or depression - and offers simple activities to help you feel calm immediately.\r\n\r\n• Find hope, peace & stability during the health crisis\r\n\r\nAccess our limited-period self-help courses to get emotional support for dealing with the health crisis. You can also talk to Allie if you’re overwhelmed by what’s going on in the world.\r\n\r\nTreat yourself to unlimited self-care, starting today.\r\n\r\nThe InnerHour app is free to download for all.

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

Or even more petty, turn off the 'wake up' sound at the end. You have to pay if you want to turn that off. All a bit pathetic. The meditation/hypnosis itself is nice, a decent length with a soothing background. You have to listen each time to a whole speech on how it works first, unless, of course, you pay to get rid of it.",

Additionally it provides users with a severity score of their depressive symptoms. This involves nine easy to answer questions. \r\n\r\nDepression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. \r\n\r\nThe PHQ-9 test consists of the actual nine criteria on which the diagnosis of DSM-IV depressive disorders is based. The diagnostic validity of the PHQ-9 is fully evidence based [1, 2]. The test has comparable sensitivity and specificity to many other extensive depression measures. \r\n\r\nPlease note: This self-test is meant to give you insight in your mood state. This test is explicitly not suitable for diagnosis. This test cannot replace professional help. When in doubt, please always contact your general practitioner.

Additionally it provides users with a severity score of their depressive symptoms. This involves nine easy to answer questions. <br><br>Depression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. <br><br>The PHQ-9 test consists of the actual nine criteria on which the diagnosis of DSM-IV depressive disorders is based.

            "Horrible game designed by someone who has no respect, empathy, or understanding for people who genuinely experience depression. The game offers nonsensical solutions to generic descriptions of how someone might describe their depression. Figures but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and not only did the game live up to its criticisms but the ads ruin its playability entirely. It's insulting tapping for a hint to see it for a nanosecond before an ad pops up preventing you from reading the hint.",
            "This feels like a soulless cashgrab, made to keep people watching ads. Most of the tasks are so convoluted, that I found myself pressing hint every time. For people with depression, like myself, this app is terrible at helping anyone through it. The people/person responsible for this, has no heart.",
            "Pretty mediocre. One of the puzzles didn't work for me regardless of me doing what the hint said to do, and the barrage of ads on the hints leave a bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes it'll only play an ad and no hint. Sucks because this had potential.",
            "Annoying as hell! Definitely makes me feel trapped like depression, great on that, but anytime i click 'hint' cause i can't get passed, all I'm met with is an ad for 30 seconds and can't read the actual hint that flashes on the screen for like half a milisecond!",
            "Very unique. This game describes how depression feels and i belive thats a great way to show people who dont quite understand how it feels. Each level is seemingly a challange but then agsin depression is as well. Good job compairing it to a puzzle because depression can take a while to figure out and piece together. As someone who can relate to being in depression you did a good job making each level a bit difficult to represent how hard it is in real life. Cool game. Would recomend. 10/10."

        "description": "The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres.

ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.<br><br>The module ANXIETY &amp; PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.<br><br>Another feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)<br><br>The module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).<br><br>The SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.<br><br>In the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.<br><br>In the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.<br><br>Thank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.<br><br>The app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

            "*Update: Wow!! Only 4€ for a full subscription!! Thank you guys!! the new features are also great!!! *I don't know yet how affordable is this app, i fear i won't be able to purchase it after they reintroduce the paying plans. But i am really thankful for this free period, i feel it helps and i really needed a good tool to help me regain balance at this strange, unpredictable time. Thank you! Great and beautiful app! 🙏",
            "I initially installed it because of the aesthetic appeal. Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced. I try to fill the three clouds when I remember, but I'm not yet regular with it. The Thought Diary function was immensely helpful in a difficult situation. Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",
            "The app is great. If you pay for the non free parts it would be a better experience. I'm currently using the free section but helps as have to think and find the positive in the day and why do I think its happend. It helps to re read when going through a rough day and realising that you have more good days if you find the good.",
            "I like it so far. Would be usefull to have it on other languages. Really like the rabbit on app icon, It may sound crazy 😄 but every day I remind my self to speak with rabbit, share my thoughts with him and try to stay positive. It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking. Meditations are ok.",
            "It has a cute visual design and is very simple to use, only I do wish there were some more features other than writing down notes. Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them. Also, I did make the subscription purchase but for some reason I rec"

The free site still allows you to journal, train/learn new topics, assign allies, and write in a discussion post. Part of my issue is that I can get overly tuned into my phone, so having premium would only encourage that bad habit for me because I'd be likely to use it all day :)",

I can see it being a great addition to therapy, but also stands on its own as an amazing recovery tool.",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",

The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "I love the concept of this application.The benefits that it provides for those who need a little light at the end of there tunnels are worth more than my words or any 5-star rating if it helps. So i noticed a few ratings for this app from some individuals who downloaded this app and gave it a rating of less than five stars followed by a negative review that looked like this \"there is no cure for depression\" and can i just say this could not be any further from the truth and it also sends a wrong message to other individuals seeking help with there own depression. Depression should never look like a dead end because it isn't and I can tell you that for a fact because I myself used to be very depressed and I often fed it with alcohol and drugs \"self-medicating\" , and after years and many attempts to stop my downward spiral i finally found my truth and with the Love from family and friends and some good counciling I was able to correct my depression and i have the ability to... ( the key word here)\"manage IT\"! I was hospitalized for 3 days and b4 i was released i met my Angel (MY DR.) At first she stated \"I think I might have something for you\" and suggested i enroll in a treatment program that she offered 2 anyone who was willing to do the work to get sober and get back to life and i said YES AMEN. i was able to receive the appropriate and professional mental health diagnosis while doing so and proud to announce that I have been free of all alcohol and street drugs for 4 years now! Thanks to this Dr. she was also able to help my mental health issues as well. So I'm currently prescribed a medication for my sobriety/cravings as well as another inperticular medication that im currently prescribed to is also a medication i use to buy on the streets ironicly however it never got me high but it did something i couldnt do myself, it helped me curb my drinking and socialize better and helped me focus on things that were important like go to work and the attitude to want to go!Sooo unbenounced to me, those very meds i was chasing illegally are now the very medication used to treat my what is now known to me as ADHD that i never was diagnosed with until i got help from my \"Angel\" my dr. and i honestly believe ADHD is the main culprit in most cases of people who battle depression! So those of you suffering with depression please consider getting a mental health diagnosis if u haven't or if you had maybe you need a second opinion if things are still not working out never give up and please never never never let anyone tell you it's not curable, it's a mental health issue not a disease; you can get help with your depression it can be managed if you choose to do so. Life i full of choices!",
            "Very great selection of music.. mostly ambient relaxing music.. there's some spa and meditation types of songs on here. They have a more uplifting and spiritual tone to it. There's a total of 5 songs by default but you can download 10 more (15 total). My only complaint is that the app doesn't work well on older devices (Android 4.4 and 5.1) because you can't download or listen to the extra 10 songs but only the 5 default one. I've tried contacting the developer but didn't get a response.",
            "Helpful, but it would be better if it could still play even outside the app.....cause I can't open other apps when I'm using it",
            "I'm glad you have this kind of app. But I'll give this 5 star if you will add some more songs. themes like forest's music, mountain calmness, and other themes. Hope you could add it like that.",
            "I love the fact that you can listen to the music off line and its a nice verity. My boy with ADHD fall's a sleep on the 1st song, and he sleeps much better than before"

            "Amazing. So helpful! Really this is the best app I have on my phone. Its the best AI therapist I've ever talked to. It actually feels like it listens and responds appropriately. Woebot really helps you through things when you need help. Also, there are no ads and no in-app purchases, it's crazy awesome. I tell all my friends who I think would benefit from having this app, because I've found it very helpful. 10/10 app, thank you so much!!",
            "This app is extremely helpful. A little robot, an anonymous person, to tell my worries to. The gratitude journal is super helpful too, I can look back on what's gone well. The lessons it provides are really helpful too. Sometimes, I open the app with just the intention of checking in my mood for the tracker, and i end up spending half an hour doing a lesson! They're always super helpful and make me feel better. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
            "Came across this through work and during lock down. I have not noticed anything negative about it, performance wise. Overall it's a useful well being tool to help check in with yourself and offers some useful prompts and insights about impactful things on a person's mood. You seem to be able to converse with it when you have a spare few mins. Fairly easy to 'forget' it's A.I . you are conversing with.",
            "The AI for Woebot sometimes misses what I am saying, but overall this app gives daily lessons on helpful thought patterns and tools. While not a replacement for therapy, it provides additional tools my therapist had not included as well as reinforcement of some of the tools I was already taught. I encourage other folks to try Woebot as a supplement to their self care routines and therapy.",
            "I found the app very comforting and helpful during a stressful period. I'm familiar with CBT but it was still useful to be reminded of those skills. And although you know it's not a real person talking to you, knowing that a real person wrote the text originally is comforting, and shows that someone cares."

As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration.

            "I love this app, it helps to guide you and gives you ideas and things to think about Update: 10/12/2020 I loved this app at the beginning. Then the question of the day stopped changing. It has been stuck on my 3 personal qualities. I stopped using the app for a while and recently got back into it and it is still asking that same question. It is irritating to me.",
            "I like it but there's a couple of bugs with the app. When I'm typing my journal entry, I scroll back up or down to fix a typo and it will take me to the next step (listing victories of the day). One time it did that and it erased everything that I typed. when I select a logged mood/activity, it pulls up the screen for the day. It will say \"no logs.\" I can only view the moods by viewing by week, or viewing a day after the actual day of the mood. For example, a mood on Aug 31 will show on Sept 1",
            "Love this so far, it very much helps to track your mood. Also it makes you think several times about the worst things in your life so that you can make sure they have some positive impact, even the smallest bit. I will be working with this app for more and I hope after some time I would be able to notice some changes in myself!",
            "So far so good. I will review after I've used it longer. Only 2 days so far but I very much like the way it is laid out - one has to stop and really think about one's self and why one feels, thinks, reacts or emotes in certain ways. I would like to know how to go back and look at my past stories. So frustrating!!!",
            "This app is incredible I love the feeling of opening this app and expressing my feeling and how my day went its like you have someone to talk to its amazing I would really recommend this app, I use this every day and wouldnt turn to a different journaling experience."

You are never asked for your real name and we’ll never disclose your personal information.\r\n• A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY USE THERAPEER?\r\nYou're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.\r\nYes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.\r\nYes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don’t always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.\r\nYes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don’t want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.\r\nBut most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond.

You are never asked for your real name and we’ll never disclose your personal information.<br>• A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.<br><br><br>WHY USE THERAPEER?<br>You&#39;re not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.<br>Yes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.<br>Yes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don’t always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.<br>Yes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there&#39;s no anonymity. There are certain issues you don’t want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.<br>But most of all: Other support group formats aren&#39;t focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there&#39;s no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.<br><br>We get all of that. We get YOU.<br><br><br>HOW DOES IT WORK?<br>• Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer.

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

            "This is a great app to get advice. It has helped me alot.",
            "thanks for making a platform for people to support others. However, a few issues that i feel really needed 1. Privacy: chat history is saved at server which includes personal data (though it is annonymous). It should be on device only. 2. Bandwidth: It fetches data everytime from the server. server perspective, you'll be charged extra & bad UX due to slowness and high data use 3. Search: serach option in chat so that old info can be referred instead of asking to the user or scrolling all history",
            "Loved the idea and the intention behind the creation of the app. The execution of it kind of lacked though. Just like Twitter, this could be a breeding ground for people seeking cheap online sympathy highs. And at some level I believe the app already has. Users that are really seeking help could potentially be given an advice by a person who only cares about making others feel good because it makes them feel good, and does not genuinely care one bit about the other person's wellbeing.",
            "It's a good app. I like the concept however I believe people giving support should be above 20. There are people reaching out but having difficulty understanding situation of the person in trouble. This end up giving more unwanted pressure for the one needing help. Keep up the good work!",
            "Thank you for your response to my review. But your response does not make sense. You cant keep a person in a app. I unstalled the app as it did not appeal to me. And plus I cant afford to pay for the subscription in order to set up profiles etc."

Even samsung health comes with free tracker for steps etc. I need a visual to help me assess and so this app and every other Anxiety app I've tried fail as nobody does the tracker for free.",

I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",
            "Thus far, I say that this app was perfectly created! So far, what I've seen is very well organized & contains helpful lessons, informational videos, a personal journal, and more! This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

            "Too buggy to use. I entered my mood for the first time and left a note with more details. After realizing I'd made a typo I tried to edit the note but the keyboard actually covers the text window so it's not possible to see what you're doing. I then tried to delete the note and just start over but it couldn't be deleted, and the changes I made couldnt be saved, so now I'm just stuck with it. Really?",
            "Very basic (that I like), so it could be more user friendly. New activities don't apply to the future, have to create it again & again. Frustrating. Sometimes it won't allow you to save the other activity. You are stuck with the main ones that don't apply. Would be nice if days could be reached by tapping on them in the calendar. Info could be shown too because now it is linear and it's impossible to see months back. You can only add the current day, if you forgot a day, you gotta scroll back.",
            "I really love this app, it helps me a lot. But everytime, the last day of the month, something happens. Last time (May), all the thingyes I wrote for the last day dissapeared. Now (June), all my emotions on the calendar dissapeared, and the counters too ! Like if I didn't do nothing this month...",
            "So far pretty good, however the amount of entries below each emoticon isn't showing for this month but shows under July and even shows 0 entries for June(when I hadn't yet installed it) Overall love the app :)",
            "What a great idea ! You can track your mood and go back to see if there are any similarities or things that may have triggered that mood. For instance everyday around a certain time your mood is tracking as a little bit lower than usual which would help you identify a cause. I could also see this being very helpful to those who have to use medications for their mental health. This would help a great deal for both patient and practitioner to see how well a medication/dose is working"

            "It's simple and cool. Autoprompting is my fav part Dev: Is there a way to customize the things that are surveyed? I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

        "description": "Do you feel stuck? Wish to feel better, hop out of the negative cycle and enjoy better wellbeing? GGDE helps people self-manage their depression by learning how to develop healthier inner dialogue and use this power to improve their mental health.\r\n\r\nIMPROVING DEPRESSION IS POSSIBLE\r\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your thinking and achieve mental wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as depression, low mood and maladaptive behaviours. \r\n\r\nDO I SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION? TESTING YOUR DEPRESSION LEVEL\r\nWe all sometimes want to know how our situation compares to others and where we are located on the graph. In GG Depression, we introduce an intuitive and quick way for self evaluation - the Assessment level. Please note that the assessment is just a guide designed for personal feedback as well as mean for our system to personalise content based on the results. The assessment test should NOT be used as medical/psychological advice.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I PREVENT DEPRESSIVE THOUGHTS?\r\nThe foundations of healthy thinking and self-talk are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \"My choices have to be prefect\", I won't be able to live up to these expectations. My confidence will decrease, my mood will become low, and depressive thoughts will take over.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our confidence and self esteem.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your thinking, start today! GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\r\nThe topics include: belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, hopelessness, helplessness, positive boost, being active, loneliness, feelings, self blame, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, fear of abandonment, trusting and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy policy:\r\nhttp://ggapps.net/privacy-policy\r\n\r\nTerms of use:\r\nhttp://ggapps.net/terms-of-use",

It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. <br><br><b>STATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)</b><br>The basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen.

Balancing this natural bias and building helpful thinking habits is shown to improve OCD beliefs and reduce symptoms.\r\n\r\nOCD, BELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self-talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us become more resilient.\r\n\r\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to helpful thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes.\r\n5. Provide daily mood and self esteem boost.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1.

It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nOCD AND THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts.

If the thought promotes helpful thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\n\r\nAs you make helpful thinking a habit, this process becomes automatic and easier.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nWe believe mobile apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG OCD is designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND JOURNEYS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Complete a set of thoughts to finish the level.\r\nTo further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, some levels you complete are followed by a quick memory game.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.\r\n\r\nDO I HAVE TO PURCHASE PREMIUM CONTENT?\r\nGG OCD is designed so you can enjoy the benefits of healthy self-talk without necessarily having to purchase anything.

            "This app went from a concise OCD app to an unfocused all-in-one app that deals with too many topics in an unfocused fashion. The old app used to have a \"daily play\" option once you progressed through the \"levels\" that let you drop into the app for a nice summary of all the previous statements merged into one level. This doesn't seem to exist anymore. The app is clunky now. The only thing good about it is that the UI looks modern but everything else is trash.",
            "I have the full version and it's genuinely helpful for OCD, but it's also overpriced for how scarce the content is. Also, lots of misspelling errors exist in the app, which make it feel unprofessional especially when you're paying. I'd like to see the devs add around triple the content (more types of exercises and little games to help!) and correct the spelling mistakes. These are two big issues, but I would still recommend the free version to people for calming from OCD caused anxiety attacks.",
            "It's not the most helpful app ever but does kill time and in the moment helps you say nice things to yourself. Worth a shot if you dont know what to say to yourself but doesnt really help to implement those behaviors. Feels more like studying flash cards for a test before learning the material if that makes any sense.",
            "Great app! I do not focus on how fast i go through it, but work to internalize some of the advice as different way of viewing things... One of my fav sayongs is - feeling pass, change, and transform..... Would also be nice if the app included mental compulsions, such as analyzing and reassurance in the assessment... Also, could use an update on a few spelling errors.",
            "Great app! Simple and intuitive but effective. One recommendation: please enable users to proceed to the next level although time limit was exceeded. Personally I like to take time to reflect on each message instead of rushing through them. I believe many others would do the same. Do that and it'll be 5 stars!"

If you're feeling sad, lonely and depressed, the last thing you want is some bubbly, colorful wallpaper mocking you every time you look at your phone! With these cynical and somber wallpapers, your background will finally match your mood.\r\n\r\nSome people are naturally happy, while others are weighed down by the pain and sorrow of the world. If you are one of the people more in touch with the dark side of your emotions, you'll definitely relate to these honest sayings. Void of colors, like your heart is void of feelings, these black and white wallpapers feature painfully realistic sayings that reflect your true thoughts.

I also needed something other than the optimistic junk my phone produces... Finally something to match my sad soul. Thank you, Leafgreen! I change the wallpapers everyday!",
            "They were all the same things, and were really boring. I found the exact same stuff on Google images, screenshotted them, and cropped the photo. There really is no point with this wallpaper app. But they were really relatable to me. Since I think I'm anonymous, I'll just say it. I have depression, I have anger issues, I have social anxiety, and I'm bipolar. These pretty much explain everything -Hope this helps",
            "too few pictures, I want more than just 25-30 pictures per app, can't you app-makers make more of an effort on both quality AND quantity, sure the pictures in this app are quite good but there are too few. \"Goth Wallpapers\" had the same problem, great pictures but less than 100 of them.",
            "This app is great. All the days when you just wanted to be alone and cry but yiu checked your phone and positivity just screamed at you, those days were annoying but now you have this. I reccomend to everyone who has the same feeling as I do.",
            "This apps message is strange, but the process is simple and easy to do. There are too many ads and not that much wallpapers to choice from. Unhappy wallpapers also provokes young children to have suicide thoughts and make them believe they have depression. I do enjoy how it shows other wallpaper apps if you're looking for different themes."

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

        "description": "If you ask any practicing psychiatrist or therapist:\r\n- What is the most common reason why people turn to you? ....\r\nIn 100% of cases you will hear the same answer:\r\n- Depression.\r\n\r\nDepression is a common illness worldwide affecting more than 300 million people. Depression differs from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to everyday life challenges. Depression may become a serious health condition particularly in case of long-lasting and moderate or severe intensity. It makes the affected person suffer greatly and perform poorly at work, at school and in family. In worst cases depression can lead to suicide. Every year, about 800 000 people commit suicide. Suicide is the second main cause of death among the people aged 15-29.\r\nDespite the availability of known and effective methods of depression treatment, less than half of affected people in the world (in many countries, less than 10%) receive such treatments. Barriers to efficacious treatment include lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers, and social stigma associated with mental disorders. Another barrier to efficacious treatment is inaccurate assessment. In countries of any income level, depressed people are often incorrectly diagnosed, while other people not having this disorder are too often misdiagnosed and prescribed antidepressants. (WHO)\r\nHalf of those who suffer from depression do not seek medical assistance, and only 25-30% of those who are depressed turn to psychiatrists. In some countries, the percentage of those who do not seek medical assistance approaches 90%.\r\nUnipolar depression is the leading cause of disability in the USA among children over 5.\r\nSpecial studies have shown that 60% of patients who turn to polyclinics have depressive disorders of varying severity. Meanwhile, as a result of diagnoses applying traditional medical methods used in polyclinics, depression is revealed in only 5% of all depressed patients who go there.\r\nDepression is diagnosed in 22-33% of hospitalized patients, in 38% of oncological patients, in 47% of patients with stroke, in 45% of patients with myocardial infarction, and in 39% of those with parkinsonism.\r\nNot so long ago, the peak of depression morbidity occurred at the age between 30 and 40 years, but today the depression has abruptly become \"younger\" and it often affects people under 25. Among the people born before 1940, the number of those who recovered from depression before the age of 25 is 2.5%. Among those born in 1940-1959, this indicator is already 10%. There is no exact data for later years, but the growth of this trend is maintained.\r\nIn this application we consider a variety of types of depression. We tell about the causes of depression, the principles of its diagnosis, modern antidepressants and other medicines used for different types of depression. Of course, we talk about ways that psychiatrists and psychotherapists can help you. And most importantly – about the ways you can help yourself!\r\nWe, practicing psychiatrists and psychotherapists, very much hope that:\r\nThe application Depression will help you and thousands of people around the world to understand your feelings, the causes of your suffering, anxiety and despair, the fear of going insane ....\r\nThis application will help you to understand that you are not alone in your illness, and that hundreds of thousands of people around the world are experiencing the same suffering and devastation that you do now.\r\nBut the most important thing that you must understand is:\r\nIf you were diagnosed Depression, it is not a sentence at all!!!\r\nIn a vast majority of cases it can be treated successfully ....",

People of all age groups suffer from depression. Studies have shown that ladies are more susceptible to this mental disease. Millions all over the world become victims of depression every year.\r\n\r\nDepression and its normal symptoms should not be ignored. It is an abnormal emotional state that can be introduced by severe sadness, despair and discouragement. It might even lead to a lamentable outcome. However, treating it can be done in many ways.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to seek a doctor's help if the feelings of emptiness and unimportance have been occurring for so many days. This is advisable even if the classic symptoms of depression don't show in a person.\r\n\r\nIn the US alone, depression affects an approximate of 10 million citizens every year. An estimation of 1 out of 4 adults is said to have experienced depression throughout their existence. When it comes to treating depressed women, antidepressants and psychotherapy are commonly used - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs to be particular.

By undergoing such methods, they can manage their depression well and they can be completely cured. Below are some helpful tips that will help a depressed person deal with the illness:\r\n\r\n•\tCreate your own schedule because as long as you are under treatment, it will be difficult for you to keep up with your regular schedule.\r\n\r\n•\tAvoid entertaining negative thoughts. Don't think about failures and blames. These are caused by depression and they should subside as depression dies down.\r\n\r\n•\tTake part in activities that can give you enjoyment and fun.\r\n\r\n•\tAvoid making any big decision in life while you are suffering from depression. It will be best to ask for the help of a family member or a reliable friend. It is often best to take it easy while in an episode, letting it run its course and allowing recovery to happen earlier.\r\n\r\n•\tAvoid taking alcoholic drinks or any medicines without getting your doctor's prescriptions because either or both of them can cause serious interactions with antidepressants and make depression even worse.\r\n\r\n•\tExercise regularly. Exercising from four to six times in a week for about 30 minutes is an effective way to treat depression. A good work out can promote the natural endorphins of the body. This creates a better mood in you. A short, simple walk or jog around the neighborhood is often enough to beat bad mood, and the additional oxygen in your system will give you more energy.\r\n\r\n•\tWatch what you eat - take in more of the good stuff and less of the bad. Don't take too much food that is rich in fat and protein. Take more vegetables and fruits. When your doctor allows it, take vitamin supplements to make sure you get enough of the good stuff.",

Last update: Dec. 2019.\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Recipes. Most popular recipes on leading web sites.\r\n\r\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks.

        "description": "How to Treat Depression Naturally\r\nMany people complain about the unpleasant side effects of prescription antidepressants, which can include increased suicidal thoughts, nausea, weight gain, loss of sexual desire or sexual stamina, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, and fatigue.[1] However, prescription antidepressant drugs are not the only way to treat depression. There are lots of natural alternatives to prescription antidepressants as well. If you are looking for a natural alternative to antidepressants, make sure that you use natural treatments for depression in conjunction with therapy and tell your therapist and your doctor about how you plan to treat your depression naturally.\r\n\r\nHow to Fight Depression and Loneliness without Outside Help\r\nDepression and loneliness are common feelings, but sometimes those feelings can become overwhelming. There are steps you can take on your own to control those feelings, such as correcting dysfunctional thinking, structuring your day, and paying attention to your health.\r\n\r\nHow to Overcome Sadness\r\nEveryone experiences sadness at some point or other in their lives. Studies have shown that sadness lasts longer than many other emotions because we tend to spend more time thinking about it. Ruminating, or going over our sad thoughts and feelings again and again, can lead to depression and keep you from overcoming sadness.\r\n\r\nHow to Tell Your Best Friend You Are Depressed\r\nIf you're suffering from depression, you're not alone. Approximately 19 million people a year in the United States alone suffer from depression.\r\n\r\nHow to Take Classes While Battling Depression\r\nDealing with depression can be extremely difficult under any circumstances. Dealing with depression while in school can feel almost impossible. Depression affects many aspects of your everyday life including your mood, energy level, sleep patterns, and motivation. Depression also affects the way you approach tasks and how effective your thinking processes are. Due to the impact on your thinking, depression can easily get in the way of your studies and learning process.\r\n\r\nHow to Know if You Have Depression\r\nDepression can be short-term, lasting for just a couple of weeks, or long-term, lasting for years. It is normal to feel sad, lonely, or hopeless sometimes\r\n\r\nHow to Cope With Depression on Your Own\r\nCoping with depression on your own is very hard.\r\n\r\nHow to Ease Depression with Relaxation Techniques\r\nLiving with depression can be an immense struggle. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or hopeless, relaxation techniques could help you find some relief.\r\n\r\nHow to Choose a Depression Medication\r\nAntidepressants are most often prescribed to patients with moderate to severe depression. However, they can also be effectively used on individuals who have mild depression or anxiety disorders\r\n\r\nHow to Fight Depression Without Drugs\r\nThe condition known as depression can range from a self-limiting case of the blues to a life-threatening illness. Medications are often prescribed for depression,\r\n\r\nHow to Get Rid of Depression\r\n\r\nHow to Fight Depression\r\n\r\nHow to Deal with Depression\r\n\r\nHow to Get out of a Depression\r\n\r\nHow to Overcome Depression Triggers\r\n\r\nHow to Conquer Depression\r\n\r\nIn this app, I will share some thoughts on how to overcome depression and start getting on the right track to change things for the better, and In this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\n* Dealing with depression\r\n* Fight Depression Naturally\r\n* How to deal with depression\r\n* How to overcome depression\r\n* How to deal with stress\r\n* How to deal with anger\r\n* How to deal with anxiety\r\n* Dealing with anxiety\r\n\r\nHow to Overcome Depression\r\nHow to Tell if You Are Depressed\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Prevent Depression\r\n\r\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star in addition when you share it with your family and friends.\r\nDo not hesitate to make your comment, suggestion, advice and so on via rrnshams@gmail.com\r\nThank you.",

            "Go to mood tracker: depression, bipolar, anxiety, etc. Simple! you can input at any time. 1-10 mood and different tags (sleepy, happy) also create tags. It tracks when you take medicine or drugs. This is the simplest app without losing functionality. Exactly what you want if you are trying to work with a psychiatrist OR manage mental health on your own. (screw moodpath lol)",
            "I love this app for tracking my moods. With bipolar two disorder, I can combine the info I track here with my fitbit sleep tracker data to provide my psychiatrist with a comprehensive look at my progress with respect to hypomanic and depressive episodes. My only complaint is the graphs. I would like to be able to change or customize how I see the data so I can better analyze trends.",
            "Exactly what you would expect it to do. Log your Moods. Edit: I have used it near every day since I downloaded 2 months ago. They say to gain power over your demons, you must name them. If you make it a habit to recognize your feelings and label them, you will feel better. Just taking the time to jot a few things down will help tremendously. I cannot suggest this app enough. And the custom reminders are beautiful. A notification to be mindful for two minutes? I couldn't ask for more.",
            "best app for recording any time of sessions: gym, Studio, study. The best by far.",
            "I love this app because in addition to the default moods and physical aspects, I can add my own that best reflect how I feel. It's in a quick, easy to use, yet sufficiently detailed format. I best love that I can put in my own notes as short or as long as I want. I don't need the complicated graphs I saw in other apps. The simple words that I use to describe myself in this app best meet my needs and allow me to more clearly convey my life to my doctor and counselor."

I don't know who's voice that is but it's so soothing and makes me unwind instantly! Don't change a thing! Thank you to the creators of this app. It's been a God send for my healing from anxiety.",
            "I've been on a severe anxiety attack that went on for 3 days. I was considering hypnosis through a consultant but stumbled upon this app. I paid the extra $$ to move the hypno sound all the way up and to put it on loop so it can play while I'm asleep. After the 1st night of listening my anxiety attack was 70% gone. 2nd night no anxiety. I've downloaded a couple of other hypnosis apps, self esteem, fear and exercise. *UPDATE* It'd be great if I could play all of the apps i unlocked while I sleep",
            "Free yet not free. Although it said the app was free, once you try it, you discover many features are not available until you upgrade to a paid version, never mentioned on the download page. It was impossible to evaluate with so many features unusable.",
            "This had become 1 of my go-to apps at the end of the day. If you don't over expect any sudden results. I just allow it to give me at least 30 min of mindfulness. When used at night I do find I sleep better.",

        "description": "There is no health without mental health.\r\n\r\nIn the past decade, depression rates have escalated, and one in four Americans will suffer from major depression at one time in their lives.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no quick fix or one-size-fits-all for overcoming depression, this app tips can help you manage depression so it does not manage you.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been struggling to figure out how to overcome depression, you may have turned to medications, talk therapy, lifestyle changes, and/or alternative treatments. Each can be effective, but they also won’t guarantee relief from that cloud of depression.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re depressed, your motivation is at an all time low. It can be difficult to make yourself breakfast, or even get out of bed when you’re really in it.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I’ve included a ‘seed habit’ tip in each section. The seed habit in each section is the easiest and most immediately actionable way to get yourself to engage in the behaviour, without having to overcome a major hurdle each time you lean into it. Think of it like your quick-start, easier-to-implement action step that you can take on today in order to get yourself on the fast track to feeling better.\r\n\r\n- Remind yourself that rumination does not increase psychological insight.\r\n- Take small actions toward problem-solving.\r\n- Reframe negative perceptions of events and high expectations of others.\r\n- Let go of unhealthy or unattainable goals and develop multiple sources of social supports.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, write down three things you did well. No need to overthink this, and no act of taking the high road is too small. For example, “When my coworker emailed the budget proposal, he forgot to cite a source. Rather than get upset, I spent two minutes researching the answer and added the information myself.”\r\n\r\nCommit to a new way of thinking and you will commit to a new way of being. If living in the past takes up a lot of your mental real estate, this app will help you rewire your thought process. Past regrets serve one purpose and that is to rob you of your resolve to do things differently in the present.\r\n\r\nHave faith in uncertainty, and in life. A good way to practice is by cultivating a state of mindfulness each and every day. When you learn to intentionally redirect your mind to what is happening in the here and now, you’ll increase your mental energy reserves so you can spend more time on enjoyable tasks. \r\n\r\nThis app guide may help you develop structure and assess whether your time is well-spent based upon your productivity and moods.\r\n\r\nDownload How To Overcome Depression now for get more info.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis application features are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends, family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post.\r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",

            "I've been meditating for like 2 weeks using this app and it's been quite useful since then, but I'd recommend few things to make it better like adding longer music ,the same small beat gets repeated in most of the themes and it doesn't feel good honestly , I only use 2 or 3 music themes outta 10 ,rest of them just don't work. Also if the timer could've been in multiples of 5 minutes it'd have been better :)",
            "I just paid 1.99 for more sounds. Most of them don't even play. I was enjoying this app up until that point. Thinking about uninstalling this.",
            "For those who are suffering from depression, loneliness or having trouble for sleeping,well this app is good for you. A relaxing music that can feel you at ease. You can select your choice of modes, and you can set your time for a prefixed duration. And the good thing is ( which I love the most ), you can use the app even if it is offline.",
            "Great app for sleep, resting, studying and relaxing. Excellent sound quality and beautifully curated pictures. App has many options for what ever mood you want, and it gives you ample time to reach the state of your desire. Thank you. I will be spending a lot of time here.",
            "I have a problem when trying to go to sleep that I can’t relax and I’m too focused on my surroundings. I tend to notice all sounds even the smallest and that does not allow me to sleep. With this app I can create the ultimate mix of zen for me by creating my own personal mix of relaxing sounds. I have sounds like a cat’s purr, wind, waves, rains, all blended at various volumes. I can say my sleep quality has improved a lot."

            "Very good therapist Zeel. It's helped me a lot. Thanks.I loved the app, it has quite a few simple but useful features. I am using anxiety program. It has helped me understand my anxiety in a simple way. Still halfway to go but it's quite helpful.",
            "Wonderful app. It has large catelog of exercises and activities. My counselor was Mrs. Madhavi Adhvaryu who really helped me to control my anxiety and develop positive attitude in life.",
            "Nice app. The counselor I got I.e Madhavi Adhvaryu is very good and supporting. But there is problem with the speed of the app.",
            "I had really high hopes for this app but i get an error every single time i try to load the introduction video. If this can be fixed then i'll change my star rating. Some other functions work and some dont. Please please fix!!!",
            "The experience has been good, as soon as I got into the app, for a much lower price then many counsellors you can have no limited chat and with a fee, which I didn't use can place phone meeting half an hour each. It's nice because you can switch between counsellors if you're not feeling satisfied and there are in the counselling section some guided exercises and articles for several purposes. Note that the price differs between therapy and program, being in this way affordable for more people."

Ive had to make 3 accounts already because it keeps telling me my password is wrong (when i know it isnt) and when i click forgot password it says it sends me an email but it doesnt (i even checked my spam) its really too bad this app doesnt work :( hopefully its fixed as it is affordable.",
            "Best overall app ive found on Play Store. It was designed to be as helpful to those using the app as possible. Life changing tools that are easy to get some understanding in the 30-40 minutes a day, or maybe 2 weeks. And it's important enough to the developers that somehow they manage to pay between 60-90 dollars to anyone that puts a little effort to finish the lessons. Amazon gift cards are incentive even for those not needing of CBT . Appreciat the people involved, and blessed they care so",
            "maybe it would work for others, and it really did help me, that is until i met one peer that flagged me as innapropriate for no reason, and now i cant talk to anyone which literally made me more depressed than when i started. maybe making a system to check if the peer is flagging for a good reason instead of just shutting us out would make me like this better... this is me giving up and signing off, i'd rather deal with my depression alone if i have to jump through hoops to talk to someone",
            "Installed the app, paid for a full account and then afterwards the system wouldnt let me complete my initial assessment to even be matched with anyone or have any goals. I messaged them right away about this...its been almost a full month now and they still have not contacted me or fixed the issue."

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

Talking about your problems or worries is not a self-centered or self-pitying endeavor. Friends and family, especially those who care about you, will appreciate knowing what's going on.\r\n\r\nEven the simple act of putting yourself in a social atmosphere can lift your spirits. Go to a place where there are people who may have similar interests as you, or even to a public spot like a museum, park, or mall, where you could enjoy being amongst people.

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "I really really like this app, DBT saved my life -- I still have much to improve upon. Practicing DBT on a daily basis has helped me to regain control of my emotions and allows me to stay focused and determined. DBT Coach is outstanding as a stand alone app, but for me personally it provides an effective substitution for a therapist during this transtion until I am able to afford individual sessions again.",
            "For $11.99 a month the app keeps crashing when certain lessons are opened. So you're paying for an app the only some content works. It's a shame because if it worked properly it would be worth it.",
            "The app is WAY overpriced. I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills. So I have used this app for two weeks and now cannot access/use the data accurately for my appointment tomorrow. If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",
            "I see potential. Needs better design and pricing. Will continue to use it to see how far I can go with free version. Also, needs someone to refresh the writing for a general audience. The video tour doesn't seem to work on my phone. Design is not intuitive. I had to figure it out by clicking around.",
            "Like the app, but it doesn't save your entry more times than not. Very frustrating."

            "Cannot book sessions. No customer support. My therapist was great, but haven't been able to book another session. This issue is not resolved!!!! Took customer support 13 days to get back to me and thier response did not help. I guess I have to wait another 13 days now...who knows? I'm so annoyed by this. I'm just going to cancel my membership - instead of Talkspace helping me with anything it's become another source of frustration in my life. Freakin' worthless.",
            "I submitted a question to customer support 11 days ago and have not gotten a response yet. I want to cancel my account, but there is no button to cancel or deactivate. This app is terrible. The texting feature is one of the major reasons I signed up for Talkspace, but I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth since my therapist does not respond for 8-12 hours. When she does respond, she just says she has some ideas that could help me, but that she will share them during our next session, making me wait several days for any sort of lifeline! I need help now! I'm paying for this service! On another similar therapy app, I was able to message back and forth with my therapist and get instant feedback. As for the video chats, I would have preferred if my therapist would have been stationed in one place the whole time instead of walking around her house. It was a bit unprofessional and even when she was sitting down because she had a tv on somewhere in the house and she was moving the camera all around making me sea sick. To make matters worse, I had no way of knowing if anyone at her house could hear our conversation! She had a lot of experience as a therapist, but admitted that she was new to Talkspace and had not yet read all of the handbook and all the rules she was supposed to follow as a provider. When we got booted out of our video call three times, she suggested that we FaceTime. Again, not professional! Talkspace is a secure platform where mental health information can be shared. FaceTime is not! I'm going back to the other app I was using before. It was slightly more expensive, but wayyyy better!",
            "Do not waste your time or money with this app. My therapist has been really wonderful and responsive, but the app is absolute trash. I reached out to support and the only response I received was, \"We've received your support request, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" That's it. No actual response to my concern. I can't book new sessions because I \"don't have any session credits available\" and there's no obvious/visible way for me to even pay to book another session. To top it off, the sessions that I have booked with my therapist have been such poor quality that I am literally talking to a blank screen because her face never shows up, despite us both having very fast internet connection speeds. I'm really disappointed in the general usability of the app, the complete lack of customer service, and the quality of the calls between me and my therapist.",
            "The issue has been resolved. Thank you! I was charged a total of 8 times in one month and still have not heard back from customer service or been issued a refund. On top of that, the app is still behaving as if i haven't renewed my subscription despite having taken 8 monthly charges out. If customer service ever reaches out and resolves the issue then I will change my rating because I love my therapist, but I dont like being multi-charged for a service I am not receiving.",
            "Received an invite link to this service. The first therapist told us they could not accommodate video sessions, which is what we paid for. The second therapist did not respond to any messages. Talkspace seems unable or unwilling to provide the service we paid for."

The counsellor builds a relationship that provides the client an opportunity to speak without inhibitions and confidentiality is assured.

The counsellor sets aside his/her own needs or positions on issues brought by the client, and focuses completely on helping the client articulate and act on his/her personal values and desires.

I'd rate much higher than 5 stars if I could. When mental health services let me down I would credit this app with literally saving my life.",
            "Sensible and practical CBT, helps you feel better about your efforts, and gives insight.",
            "I recently came across this and I find it enjoyable and helpful. I'm not sure how I feel about the points yet, but it seems like a cool idea. I like that it has tests, organized set ups for different types of diary logs. It also gives you ideas and helpful tips. It makes it easier to decide how you're feeling and gauge how strongly you're feeling it. Lots of options and articles, and more! This is pretty cool, I'll be telling people about this app."

        "description": "How to Deal With Depression?\r\n\r\nA negative state of mind, Depression is a type of disease that can become a chronic problem if left being untreated. While it can be a passing state for some people, it can be a lasting and constant issue for the others. This mental disorder can worsen and even make people sick enough to contemplate committing a suicide. Here are some ways on how to deal with depression and keep the symptoms in check. \r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\nIt is a powerful way to fight depression without using any prescription drugs. Regular workouts can reduce the level of anxiety, stress, and depression due to the increase in the mood-boosting chemicals in the brain that is known as “Endorphins”. This help boost the mood and can make them have a sense of euphoria. Improvements in muscle strength and tone, cardiac health and blood flow are some other benefits. Rebound exercise is known to be a fantastic detoxifier and natural depression-reliever. Yoga, biking, swimming, low-impact aerobics, dancing and even walking are other powerful ways. \r\n\r\nSSRI\r\n\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) is the most commonly prescribed medicine for the treatment of depression. When compared to other types of antidepressants, such as Adaptin, Elavil, Marplan, and Parnate that are not used so much today, SSRIs produce fewer side effects. \r\n\r\nHerbal medications\r\n\r\nThese are natural medicines made from organic ingredients that herbs are, and can help in managing depression symptoms or even rooting out the problem in the course of time. Herbalists recommend the use of various powerful herbs such as Siberian Ginseng, Kava Kava, St. John's Wort, Ginko Biloba and more. For people looking for tips on how to deal with depression through natural means, herbs are one of the best solutions. \r\n\r\nVitamin supplements\r\n\r\nThe use of Vitamin supplements, including B-complex Vitamins, can be helpful in improving the mood of patients. It has been scientifically proven that a deficiency in B vitamins is a common cause for depression in people. Most multivitamins available in the market today have B vitamins present in them. However, it is important to check package instructions or better – consult a doctor – in order to improve the mood. \r\n\r\nPsychotherapy\r\n\r\nIt is one of the various ways to cure depression. While psychotherapy is being conducted, patients suffering from the condition talk about their issues and mental conditions to the psychologist or counselor. Based on his medical expertise, expertise, and evaluation of the condition of the patient, the counselor offers suggestions and mechanism for coping with the problem. \r\n\r\nElectroconvulsive therapy\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best ways of how to deal with depression of severe nature. Electroconvulsive therapy or ECT is used for curing major and severe cases of depression. In this process, the brain of the patient is subjected to an electric current. The current is passed through the scalp to induce a seizure in the brain. This is one of the safest ways to alleviate symptoms of suicidal or depressive people. It is typically used when patients suffering from acute cases of depression do not show any response to other types of therapy. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a preview of what you will get with the how to deal with depression:\r\n\r\n•\tWhat Is Depression?\r\n•\tHelping Someone with Depression\r\n•\tDealing With Depression?

It was amazing. I was assigned to Shreya, the therapist ,she made me realise to focus on stuff that I never realised before. Hope anyone reading this and is confused about life. Please go for pinky mind. They will help you come out through. Kudos to them for helping people like us!!",

            "The service is AMAZING! I have no regrets using this app to chat with a doctor for something quick. The reason I knocked 2 stars off though is the AI at the start of EVERY chat. It only lists symptoms and takes you through a very thorough, automated chat session. If you are someone who doesn't know what you're dealing with it would be really useful, however in any case where you know your issues, such as Asthma and you're in need of a simple prescription/refill - it'd be nice to skip it.",
            "These doctors are awesome! They listen to you and help you! I didn't think it was real at first. But I had an ear infection and a doctor wouldn't see me for a month. So I tried this and they called in ear infection meds instantly and they said 3-4 days before your better but I started feeling better in an hour! Excellent app!! Thank You for having this available. Highly recommended!!!",
            "My experience was great!! I'm so glad this worked just like it's promised to. I paid for the service of $19 and was given a receipt through email. After downloading the app I answered some questions about my issue, took maybe 10 minutes, and was then directed to a certified doctor. She asked me a few questions and sent the prescription I needed to the pharmacy of my choice. I called to verify if they'd received it and sure enough it was and being filled. I highly recommend this service!!",
            "Its okay, but it always takes you to worst case scenario. Like I have pain in my ribs. Localized, no fever, no headache, no chills, no sneezing, no coughing, no shortness of breath, wasn't near anyone sick... It told me I either had an upper respiratory or pneumonia. I actually somehow tore the cartilage between the ribs, likely from lifting something too heavy. Bruised ribs wasn't even a suggestion.",
            "Very user friendly simple AI. Very cool AI also asks your symptoms to help diagnose incase one is a closet hypochondriac.suppose one could get a subscription monthly and just see what one might MAYBE could sorta kinda have. If that were the case just saying cause I thought it was superfluous knowing already what I had and what I needed medication for but for real diagnosis there is the option to speak to a dr. And if possible they prescribe a medication for you and send it to your pharmacy"

        "description": "Depression is a serious illness that can affect the work power, family and social life of a person. This is why we don’t have to ignore it and hide it. It is important to know the symptoms, the causes and what possibilities we have to prevent it.\r\nEach one of us had at some point a depressing sad moment. Depression is a normal human reaction associated to a loss, with the tumult of everyday life or with an agitated sentimental life. Sometimes the sadness sensation passes but sometimes it doesn’t, it becomes more persistent and it can conduct to nervous breakdowns. The diseases of the nervous system are very serious and that is why it is important not to pass them by without proper help when we realize we can’t handle them by ourselves. Getting help is not only normal, but required also.\r\nHere are some of the symptoms of depression:\r\n-\tsadness\r\n-\tloosing energy\r\n-\tloosing hope in life and others\r\n-\tnot finding pleasant anymore the things you used to love \r\n-\thaving trouble concentrating\r\n-\tuncontrolled crying\r\n-\theadaches, other types of inexplicable aches and itches\r\n-\tneeding to sleep a lot or on the contrary not getting any sleep at all\r\n-\tloosing appetite and loosing weight at the same time\r\nThese are just some of the symptoms of depression and if more of them are associated they are not to be ignored and a discussion with a close person or a specialist has to happen very soon.\r\n \tWhat causes depression? There is not a single source that causes depression. This is a complex disease that can appear as a result of multiple causes. Depression can also be transmitted among persons that are close to each other, by influence.   \r\n\r\n \tThere are proofs that say persons suffering of depression suffer brain changes. There are also proofs that explain how depression can also be genetic. Children affected by the depression of their parents or parents whose children suffer from chronic depression are more likely to be affected themselves by this illness.\r\n\r\n \tTo try and prevent depression we have to know ourselves very well. Although treatable depression can be hard to prevent once we are already melancholic. The best method to avoid another crisis after a chronic depression is to keep and eye open to its symptoms and its causes. And also get professional hope whenever we feel like we need it.",

It grows and thrives as a consequence, goes beyond tolerance, making our lives miserable. Lives are complicated and we cannot stay on top of our problems all the time. People are just being hammered in many ways and that lead to their collapse in the direction of their genetic susceptibility and biological weakness.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app is developed as a tool for introspection and will provide you with evidence-based information about emotional problems and mental disorders. It will teach you cognitive behavioural therapy and other self-help methods, and techniques, specifically designed to help with overcoming depression, generalized anxiety and worry, social anxiety and shyness, divorce and separation, loss and bereavement. It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking. Cognitive behavioural therapy is proven to be effective in the long term by applying the techniques and shift the way you think. It can help you find a meaning and purpose, negotiate with yourself and be free from your past. \r\n\r\n“Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind;\r\nFor the soul is dyed by the thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Depression section, you will learn more about psychological, medical and alternative treatments for relief, reduction, prevention and dealing with major depressive disorders, dysthymia, bipolar disorder. By using the self-help methods you can learn helpful ways of thinking, that will help overcome depression now and in the future. It will also help you to practice ways of living your life and relating to people that leave you less vulnerable to depression.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Anxiety and Worry (GAD) section you will have the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and worry and whether you are a worrier. A helpful set of strategies will show you how to deal with the purpose, meaning, and content of your worries. And, at the end, you will have a different perspective on how to manage it. The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you'll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief. Although it's not possible to turn back the clock or remove the fact of a loss, you may find some of these ideas are useful for helping with your grief.\r\n\r\n*The app is not designed to treat clinical levels of depression or anxiety, or other mental health disorders. Further counseling is needed as the diagnosis and treatment require a medical practitioner or a qualified mental health professional.",

        "description": "Depression and a Low Mood\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone experiences stressful times and low mood occasionally. Usually, this is related to an event in life such as working too long hours, or a tragedy that you’re coping with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut these types of low moods usually pass eventually. When a low mood doesn’t pass, usually within about two weeks, or you cannot identify why you’re feeling bad, then you may be suffering from depression. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are other illnesses that you can have that manifest as low moods, such as thyroid disorders, low vitamin D3 levels in the blood, and even anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s imperative that you seek professional diagnosis to ensure that what you really have is depression before you try to treat your condition. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember that sadness like other feelings is a valid, human emotion. Everyone who feels low is not depressed. When you’re sad, it’s likely that someone can still make you happy, or you can listen to happy music, or do your favorite hobby and feel better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, when you are depressed you cannot find joy in even the things that used to give you joy, no matter what they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression may happen even at the happiest time of your life because it has nothing to do with outward events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it’s true that sometimes depression can be triggered by a normal life event that you’re having trouble accepting and getting over, usually it just happens for what seems like no reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s not different from getting another disease such as diabetes. It has a physiological reason for happening even if we’re not totally sure yet what causes it, but it has a treatment that can help you manage it or cure it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are depressed, you cannot just snap out of it. You can’t just listen to a happy song, play with your kids, go for a walk, read positive things, or write a journal and expect it to magically go away. \r\n\r\n\r\nTypes of Depression\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of depression. If your symptoms have persisted for a long time, be honest with your doctor about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t leave anything out. Even if you’re not sure it’s related to your disorder, you want to tell the truth and be honest so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•    Major Depression – Usually there is a combination of symptoms that have lasted for two weeks or longer. These symptoms interfere with your ability to enjoy everyday life, even when you loved them before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may feel empty, moody, hopeless, pessimistic, worthless and more. You may even have thoughts of suicide or have attempted suicide. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•    Dysthymia – If someone has depression for more than two years without it lifting, it’s considered chronic. It’s not different from major depression but you may have to be treated longer (if not for a lifetime) if you are diagnosed with dysthymia. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•    Persistent Depressive Disorder - Some people are depressed for a long time, over two years, but it comes and goes. Some days you’re able to be happy, but the depression comes back. This differs from bipolar in that you don’t have manic episodes, just times of normalcy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•    Bipolar Disorder – There are many types of bipolar disorder that also involve depression. But often it includes manic episodes where you feel on top of the world, and then you plunge into a depression that seems to have no end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•    Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) – This is depression that happens due to weather, specifically dreary weather that keeps you from the sun. Some people find relief using light therapy but for some, this doesn’t work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•    Psychotic Depression – This is typical depression along with a separation from reality. A person may suffer from delusions, false beliefs that are disturbing to others, and even hear voices and see things that aren’t there.",

When you’re sad, it’s likely that someone can still make you happy, or you can listen to happy music, or do your favorite hobby and feel better.<br><br><br><br>But, when you are depressed you cannot find joy in even the things that used to give you joy, no matter what they are.<br><br><br><br>Depression may happen even at the happiest time of your life because it has nothing to do with outward events.<br><br><br><br>While it’s true that sometimes depression can be triggered by a normal life event that you’re having trouble accepting and getting over, usually it just happens for what seems like no reason.<br><br><br><br>It’s not different from getting another disease such as diabetes. It has a physiological reason for happening even if we’re not totally sure yet what causes it, but it has a treatment that can help you manage it or cure it.<br><br><br><br>When you are depressed, you cannot just snap out of it. You can’t just listen to a happy song, play with your kids, go for a walk, read positive things, or write a journal and expect it to magically go away. <br><br><br>Types of Depression<br><br><br>There are many different types of depression. If your symptoms have persisted for a long time, be honest with your doctor about them.<br><br><br><br>Don’t leave anything out. Even if you’re not sure it’s related to your disorder, you want to tell the truth and be honest so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated.<br><br><br><br>•    Major Depression – Usually there is a combination of symptoms that have lasted for two weeks or longer. These symptoms interfere with your ability to enjoy everyday life, even when you loved them before.<br><br><br><br>You may feel empty, moody, hopeless, pessimistic, worthless and more. You may even have thoughts of suicide or have attempted suicide. <br><br><br><br>•    Dysthymia – If someone has depression for more than two years without it lifting, it’s considered chronic. It’s not different from major depression but you may have to be treated longer (if not for a lifetime) if you are diagnosed with dysthymia. <br><br><br><br>•    Persistent Depressive Disorder - Some people are depressed for a long time, over two years, but it comes and goes. Some days you’re able to be happy, but the depression comes back. This differs from bipolar in that you don’t have manic episodes, just times of normalcy. <br><br><br><br>•    Bipolar Disorder – There are many types of bipolar disorder that also involve depression. But often it includes manic episodes where you feel on top of the world, and then you plunge into a depression that seems to have no end.<br><br><br><br>•    Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) – This is depression that happens due to weather, specifically dreary weather that keeps you from the sun. Some people find relief using light therapy but for some, this doesn’t work. <br><br><br><br>•    Psychotic Depression – This is typical depression along with a separation from reality. A person may suffer from delusions, false beliefs that are disturbing to others, and even hear voices and see things that aren’t there.",

        "description": "A mood disorder is a mental health problem that primarily affects a person’s emotional state. It is a disorder in which a person experiences long periods of extreme happiness, extreme sadness, or both.\r\n\r\nIt is normal for someone’s mood to change, depending on the situation. However, to be diagnosed with a mood disorder, symptoms must be present for several weeks or longer. Mood disorders can cause changes in your behavior and can affect your ability to deal with routine activities, such as work or school.\r\n\r\nWhat you will learn:\r\n    • What is a mood disorder?\r\n    • Depression\r\n    • Bipolar disorder\r\n    • Other mood disorders\r\n    • What causes mood disorders?\r\n    • What are the symptoms of common mood disorders?\r\n    • How are mood disorders diagnosed?\r\n    • How are mood disorders treated?\r\n    • Medications\r\n    • Psychotherapy\r\n    • Brain stimulation therapies\r\n    • Treatments for seasonal depression\r\n    • What’s the outlook for people with mood disorders?\r\n    • Living with Bipolar Disorder\r\n    • Get involved in your treatment\r\n    • Monitor your symptoms and moods\r\n    • Reach out for face-to-face connection\r\n    • Develop an active daily routine\r\n    • Keep stress to a minimum\r\n    • Watch what you put in your body\r\n\r\nTwo of the most common mood disorders are depression and bipolar disorder.

Grief or sadness is a typical response to a traumatic life event or crisis, such as the death of a spouse or family member, loss of a job, or a major illness. However, when the depression continues to be present even when stressful events are over or there is no apparent cause, physicians would then classify the depression as clinical or major depression. For a person to be diagnosed with clinical depression, symptoms must last for at least two weeks.\r\n\r\nThere are several different types of depression.

            "The app is gentle in its approach and takes you step by step through the reasons why you feel anxious or depressed. It has lots of tools to help you see things from different perspectives and help you make changes so you can be happier. You do need a referral from a GP to get a log in though.",
            "For those writing 1 star because they can't create an account. This app is linked to the silver cloud service which you request/get referred to in your area. Those of you who are saying you can't create an count is because usually you need to get an account set up for you by a therapist or other professional. It actually says in the information that it's 'made available to individuals through certain health care plans, GP' s and universities.'",
            "I hate this app and this site. It talks to you like you are a dumb baby, and in a very slow manner which I find frustrating. This app is supposed to help moods, not make me want to punch a wall. I was given an account to this app as there is now no therapy available to my area at the moment, but I'd rather go it alone on my own better resources than drudge through this rubbish.",
            "The great thing with this app is the content/program itself. The app design is simple, clear and appropriate for my learning abilities - aesthetically.",
            "Unless you get referred by your doctor in the NHS you can't use it. All the people saying the app is useless don't understand it's purpose. It's not for general use. Get a referral."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

All of our therapists have a degree (at least a master’s, some a PhD) and specialty: psychologists (PsyD/PhD), licensed professional counselors (LPC), clinical social workers (LCSW/LMSW) and marriage and family therapists (MFT).

While experience and expertise vary, you are guaranteed to find a match. We have specialists on addiction, anxiety, depression and couples therapy; some of our therapists are members of the LGBTQ community, and some specialize in providing therapy to members of the community; others still are more spiritual and religious, and you will be paired with them if you so wish.\r\n\r\nAnd the best part is that after being matched, and seeing for yourself if you connect to your therapy provider – you are free to switch therapists, at any time and at no extra cost – with no inconvenience to yourself.

            "I feel like this is a really good app, gives me a little bit of responsibility by waking up my buddy and gets me to go out and do simple but meaningful tasks. It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30–40 percent.
