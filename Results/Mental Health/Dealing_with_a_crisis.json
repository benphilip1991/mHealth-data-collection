Access the coins gathered=AD Start level=AD, Finish level=AD , change weapon =AD ..get diamonds =AD Buy upgrade for weapon =AD im not sure how you can even consider this \"OK\" to claim as a game. This is basically an AD player with a short game in between TONS OF ADS. I've been a gamer since 1996 and this has to be the WORST AD CONTENT I have ever been a witness to. I never leave a bad review, but this deserves one and many more.",
            "1. The ad that led me to download this game is misleading. This is a top down shooter, not first person as the ads suggest. 2. It has more ads than most games. 3. The roulette wheel only gives credits. It never stops on gems or the weapon. There is much better out there.",
            "I think it is a very good game, there are a lot of ADS but a way around that is turn off your internet! Always complaining about that but it's completely offline. Turn it back on when you're trying to excersise or get new perk's and item's then you won't get ads non stop!",
            "Yo I got this game I love it cause there are no scams, it's possible to level up without ads or in-game purchase lol there are no in-game purchases. You see these are the games I love that are different from really competitive games against other players like warzone and fortnite also ones that don't rip you off like those two games I listed. This is probably my favorite game after literary 5 minuets of playing it lol.",
            "I'm at level 302.....i can't be beat. A lot of ads, but it's a time killing game, so i have time for ads üòÖüò≥üòÖ. Keep spinning the wheel, you will eventually get the best gun. I already maxed out and can't spend anymore gems......reached 1000 days ....done with this fun. Wish i could had a pic of where i stand. Have fun. Thanks too the developers."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

This phase also includes you to understand what puts you down from going forward. Essentially a self-analysis about yourself is what his phase is all about.

Once you start to realise your purpose and your goals it would make it easier to move in the right direction. Living your core values and following your passion are the things that can help you get over this phase in life.\r\n\r\n       4.\tStrengthen Your Sense of Identity: Give yourself time alone and go to places that are quiet where you can learn a lot about yourself and know who you are. Working on relationships and finding new ways to grow can personally help you overcome this phase and realise that you no more have an identity crisis. \r\n\r\n     If you are able to follow these four steps in life then you would be easily able to overcome the identity crisis that you were faced with.

        "description": "How to Overcome Anxiety is an application that helps you to overcome disruptions in your life Anxiety is a condition that usually arises with excess stress and worry. It is usually the feared possibility of the consequences of an action that brings about anxiety. The people who get anxious are always worrying about the bad things that might happen and thus create an environment of fear in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nin this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nDealing with depression\r\nFight Depression Naturally\r\nhow to deal with depression\r\nhow to overcome depression\r\nhow to deal with stress\r\nhow to deal with anger\r\nhow to deal with anxiety\r\ndealing with anxiety\r\nhow to deal with a breakup\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about How to Overcome Anxiety \r\n\r\nIf you want to know how to overcome anxiety, you must be quick to notice what wrong with you and what you need to do to correct it.\r\n\r\nIt is wise you quickly learn how to overcome anxiety now otherwise you will continue to feel stressed, unhappy and anxious throughout your life. You will suffer unduly because anxiety will weaken you mentally, sap your energy and you will not be at your best. Anxiety comes in many forms. Some suffer from panic disorder where there are unpredictable attacks of panic on the person, with its physiological consequences, while some others feel helpless in an embarrassing situation and this is agoraphobia. There are also others suffering from various other phobias like fear of heights, insects and water. Some feel that they are always watched by others, and thus suffer from social anxiety disorder. People who have undergone some traumatic event in their past suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Some people perform repeated and ritualistic behaviors to rid themselves of obsessive compulsive disorders and the most common form of anxiety is generalized anxiety disorder. These people are usually over anxious of a situation and may end up in some major depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, anxiety comes in many forms, and the first step to be taken in the treatment of anxiety lies in finding out what the cause is. Once the reason of the anxiety has been found out, it proves to be rather easy to cure anxiety. It is best to avoid these situations as much as possible in the beginning of your treatment so that there is no feeling of anxiety at all.\r\n\r\nIt may be needed to approach a psychiatrist to help in the treatment of anxiety. Under their guidance, you learn to handle anxiety attacks in three steps; before, during and after the anxiety attack.\r\n\r\nA person who suffers from anxiety should not set self-defeating goals. It is instead better to set productive and possible goals that improve one's thought and action. With this step, the patient learns to gain better control over oneself and thus overcome anxiety. When suffering from a bout of anxiety, it is better to calm oneself naturally rather than trying to fight or control one's anxious feelings.\r\n\r\nSomeone with anxiety should work at producing positive thoughts in the mind. Once pessimistic or unpleasant thoughts enter the mind, it is better to divert oneself and think of other situations with vivid, optimistic pictures. If possible, it proves to be better to think positive thought of these pessimistic thoughts, using objective words.",

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ‚òπÔ∏è I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

This game main purpose is being a game and a good time waster about apocalyptical global warming, economical growth going crazy, and the goal is to lead the green energies industrial revolution.\r\n\r\n2.  If you don't believe in man induced global warming and don't like ecology, then you could do yourself a favor by not playing this game.\r\n\r\n3.

If you think there's a problem with a country in particular, please tell me so ! I'll cross check your facts and I'll change its stats in the game, if possible. \r\n\r\n5. About frontiers & borders now .... The map has been made in 2014 from a 2000's United Nations source. You may find borders are not accurate from your country's political point of view. I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings but this game isn't about borders at all but about ecology and I can't resolve all the conflicts there were about borders in the last century in the game...\r\n\r\n6. The borders are not the 1850's ones and it may seems a little odd because it is said it's starting in the 1850s. It's like this because the countries were, at the time, different from now, with lots of differents names, small kingdoms, Empires and colonies and much more problem with borders than now ... It would have been difficult to add a way to deal with that fact across time in a game that try to focus on the story of the energy transition. It would have been a mess. Also, the game needs you to recognize quickly the countries' names of the world so these are some reasons why it has been chosen to keep the beginning of the XXI century's world's (midly accurate) borders.\r\n\r\n7. Nuclear power. The game may please and displease both anti-s and pro-s nuclear energy : when there is a growth, Nuclear is perfectly safe (no words about radwaste and hurricane-proof, that's quite a gift!) but when there's a crisis, when countries have no more money, then nuclear plants may explode, just like Tchernobyl, meaning with an economic impact. Again, this is a sci-fi game and the developer is not a lobbyist.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI hope you'll have a nice time playing that not-so serious game and saving planet earth from auto-destruction, numerous times!\r\n\r\nMusic credits :\r\nJAN125 / http://opengameart.org/content/sage-of-corinth-music\r\nand Nosoapradio_us / https://www.facebook.com/freegamemusic/",

My biggest critique would probably be the development of certain countries, like Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and I think Gabon: whilst every other aspect is incredible, I think the fact they have max 32 cities and the fact you need 50 mil to unlock green means that these countries kinda fizzle out and die.",

Having done that, you can then simply enter it into the App so that it is easy to retrieve from your smartphone at any time.<br><br>Similar to the App developed by the Robert Enke Foundation (EnkeApp), the Safety Plan App is designed to help you in a crisis situation. There is, however, no paid service provided. You need to enter the telephone numbers of your own contacts who will be able to help you in a crisis. Why not give it a go?<br><br>The App is not intended to recognise, prevent, monitor, treat or alleviate illnesses. The App acts like a notebook, allowing you simply to enter the steps of your personal safety plan so that they can be quickly accessed. Do keep a physical copy of your safety plan with you, however, so that you are still prepared even if your smartphone breaks or runs out of battery.<br><br>We would be grateful for your feedback!",

I would love the ability to add more than one coping strategy, support person, etc. The link when you first open the app to get more guidance on how to develop a safety plan is dead. Fixing this is critical to the app's usefulness. A walkthrough to customize the plan when you first open the app would be amazing.",

            "Beautiful app, with great instruction. It really helps with knowing deeper mindfulness. I have practiced meditation and mindfulness for over 10 years. Perhaps adding the option of music during the meditation might be the only improvement I would make... and possibly lengthen the log area just about 20-30 more characters for logging ideas. Thanks again for providing the app.",
            "I love this app! It really works if you give it a chance, it's also something from the Government that's REALLY FREE! I been suffering from PTSD for over 20 years. Living on a fixed income makes it impossible to afford someone elses income. Just by hapenstance I found this & I thank God that I have a way to calm myself down on/in those \"uncomfortable\" times.",
            "Neat, clean, simple, and simply the best meditation app. No ads, no subscriptions - just mindfulness. Kudos to the great work! Note: used to be buggy when I tried a year or two ago. But now (as of summer 2020) it is totally bug-free and faultless.",
            "Such an awesome app that too free of cost...the mindfulness exercise they provide I thought they will charge for it because they are so helpful and for every thing in your life a mindfulness is present whether for emotional distress,nap,sleep, eating,walking everything...thank you so much the developers..god bless you ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "By far one of the best and cleanest and most simple mindfulness app I have ever used. The lessons are very helpful too, you can really tell this was created out of good and kind intentions: to help others be more self-aware in order for us to execute decisions thought about thoroughly.

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "Seems to have a lot of information which is good but also part of my problem with the app: there is too much content for how little organization there is. It's really overwhelming clicking on a topic and then seeing a list of like 100 audios or texts. Not easy to find what you're looking for or even know what you're looking for",
            "So far, this seems to be one of the better DBT apps out there. You can go back and edit your diary cards as needed, and you can add new fields, either on the 0-5 scale or a write-in box. I would still like the ability to turn off default fields so I can make the diary card look like the one I'm using in the program I am in. Other than that, it seems pretty good. It has a lot of good info in there about the skills, too, if you need reminders.",
            "So far, have only used the diary card, but here's what I especially like: 1. I can add additional fields, either as diary texts, or 0-5 sliders. The GUI is clean, simple, very easy to use. The app works off-line so it's perfect for tablets that are not Cell-mobile capable and do not always have internet connectivity via WiFi. It doesn't need a lot of device permissions, and no ads! It can be password protected for privacy if desired. Will investigate other capabilities over the next few days.",
            "So far I think it's good... Still assessing. What I was hoping to have where says crisis, if you need to regulate a specific emotion at any moment I wish a app (and this seems most likely to do it) could walk you through the whole process in a moment of crisis. I'm very new to DBT but if I realize I'm having a moment, I'm not going to start reading exercises in a public bathroom, rather need something to walk me through my thoughts based on the situation. An active guide if in need of help.",
            "Bedankt ontwikkelaars! This an extremely valuable resource for any client or clinician who is learning the DBT Skills or who has completed DBT skills trainings. What sets this particular app apart from most others in the android marketplace that it is based on the latest Skills Training Manual. Additional skills are included which are not available on many other apps. The features enabling the client to send diary entries to the therapist is a particular useful highlight feature of the app and also the agreement module in which clients can collaborate with their individual therapist in constructing crisis management plans. In terms of the gui of the app, the developers have chosen a darker coloured interface which is easy on the eyes and the phone battery usage. The app can be locked by a password, useful in cases where the phone may be used by others. Well done to the developers of this app. It is a really well designed app and will prove invaluable to clients of DBT and their therapists."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!üòÅ",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

It‚Äôs not always easy to effectively deal with tough situations like abusive relationships, financial crunch, grief, trauma, depression and attracting the wrong people and circumstances in our life. And at these times especially, it‚Äôs tough to bring a self change and change the circumstances.

Ads only happen if you want to make a bit of in-game cash. I would like to know what an upgrade will get me. \"Improved performance\" and \"more crafting options\" doesn't shed much light on what higher level buildings can do. Haven't found uranium yet.",

It's amazing how much you can do. There's always something new to explore etc. Its only downside is that the gameplay is extremely slow, but it also has its charms: it gives a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of the road. Dear developer, if you see this, just know that i love your work and can't wait to see what comes next.",

All of the content in the game can be enjoyed by players regardless of their budget. It is a difficut game to get the hang of and so a discord group has been created by the developer to assist players in progressing through the game and allowing them to socialize with other players.",
            "Lots of bugs. Lacks instruction. I have everything that is says for Hydroponics (something needed for the game) yet fails to let me make it. Do I need to research something fails to tell me in the game. There is no close button when you open menus in the game. Pressing on top where close button should be works. Fun game too bad it's so clunky. Five out of five if you fix the issues...",
            "It's a fun game and I like the idea but the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the UI. It jitters when you switch outposts and doesn't register half my taps, meaning you have to press the button twice for it to do something. Developers, if you're reading this, please improve the UI! Make it less jiterry and clunky and I'll up my review to 5 stars."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "What a miserable \"game\". The devs trap you into turning WiFi on to progress to the next level so I just turned it on, pressed the button and turned it off as soon as I was in the level. Which may I add are pathetically easy. This is the bare bones minimum for a game, and I took joy out of every penny I did not give the greedy bastards who made this loathsome pile of garbage.",
            "Scam. As mentioned in other reviews, unplayable because of the insane number of ad pop-ups. So, I go to the Home screen and find an option for \"ad-free\" for $2.99. Ok, I bite.... It's less than a cup of coffee. Am I add-free? Not even close! But got another purchase option 'bundle' for $4.99 to go add-free. Thought that was what I just paid for! No option to give this a negative star rating.",
            "I like that you had the good sense to create the game that everyone else has falsely advertised for. It is very fun and engaging. I like the puzzles and the story line that comes with them. However, the amount of ads is excessive. I'm on the 20th-ish level but I've seen like 35 ads between level 1 and 20. I also noticed that if the storyline cutscenes are too long, my screen cuts out. I think if you fix those 2 things you'll have a great success.",
            "Awful Game! The play is too easy and takes only seconds to finish each level, which makes sense since the main goal of the developer is to make lots of time for the pervasive amount of ads. This should actually be a zero star \"game\". I use the word 'game' loosely since this is merely one long commercial with three- second-long breaks to play a game my infant niece could figure out. Don't waste your time or money!",
            "The game seemed like it would be fun but in the first 10 minutes of game play i spent at least 8 minutes watching ads i understand developers need to make money too, but I refuse to play a game that has obnoxious levels of forced advertising. Unless you enjoy spending most of your time watching ads and very little time playing the game I recommend finding another game."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Great game but guild chat is lacking and not linear. It should be obvious and on top of that, the game does not support landscape view, which is a bummer. I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",
            "The game is all about pay to play. If you try to play it for free, you'll get so far behind that it is ridiculous. The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend ¬£95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend ¬£95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . üëç",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training.

Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 üåü is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.üëçüëçüëç",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. üëé",

            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",

Made my eyes water up , I can't play anymore : good luck ü§ó And to all future players. If you see VGA:top or any other. Just leave. I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",

I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",

It is really funny to solve so many puzzles. But actually, there' re too less rooms, only 12. Am waiting for the next upd.",

What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw!

            "A good strategy game, not too mechanically complex and decently challenging. A treat for fans of the series. Most of the negative reviews are people upset about being able to buy things. Look, all free games want your money. But FEH is pretty generous with what you get for free, has no ads, is from a trusted name, and no game mode is behind a pay wall. You can build up a deep bench of heroes and be competitive in PVP modes and never spend a single dollar.",
            "FEH is unfortunately plagued by many issues. If you're like me, and play for the characters you love, you won't have fun. I've spent hundreds of hours (and real money) collecting and upgrading my favorites, just for them to be outclassed by whatever new OP 5* of the week gets released. You have to pull a character 11 times to max out their power, ridiculous. It's all up to luck if you get the characters you want, and even if you do they'll probably suck. Play Three Houses instead.",
            "I love this game, and there is a ton of stuff to do in it. The amount of free orbs (the real money currency) you get seems to be decent. While I have some minor balancing issues with the game, the main reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the limit on inventory. There are 580 characters; why do we only get 300 slots before having to spend orbs? This has not changed since the launch of the game as far as I'm aware. I feel like we should have free slots equal to the # of different units",
            "As someone who spent 2 thousand on this game, i feel qualified to say: I cant believe advanced wars died to this franchise. Power creep. Bloated summoning pool. Terrible features. Predatory mechanics to spend money. If you like this stuff, then this is the game for you. Dont speak to me ever again, intelligent systems. Hit me with a generic automated response and ill hit ya with a KleanYoSelf",
            "Very fun and rewarding. Purchases are not needed for good characters but I do it anyway because the prices are actually reasonable. Edit: I was actually getting a new player new character summon boost I wasn't aware of back then. It is a little hard to get the characters you want without spending money, and sometimes even still so with spending, but if you are a Fire Emblem fan, it is still a very fun, challenging, and rewarding game."

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account üòÅü§´",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "It's a good game, but only if you want to spam cards, been on this game for a couple years now. I've come and gone and they still have things that make it near impossible for non pay to win players to progress. If you want to progress you need to get powerful gear, a good way to do that is events. An event that requires a 300k gear score will one shot people with a 1m gear score. If your not looking to progress and just want to chill with random people, it's a good game to be on.",
            "The fact that I've been playing this game for ever since like four years ago and they still haven't fixed the neverending \"Now Loading\" screen is just... honestly, disappointing. You're forced to exit the game every two or three quests you do and the devs haven't done anything to change that. I came back for the sake of nostalgia but it's let me down once again. Annoying.",
            "The general overall experience of the game is good. Recent updates have however caused regular issues in game such as freezing and dodgy connections (which yes u have tested and aren't just my signal). The company clearly puts a lot of thought into new things to add to the game, I just feel they need to address bugs more because since the last lot were added, it's been months with no change, yet loads of new content for them to make money. Clearly their priority is money and nothing else",
            "Honestly, I fell in love with the game a few years back. I still enjoy it to a certain degree, but some things have been bugging me: 1. There are some minor glitches like people or monsters not loading. While it seems innocent, it becomes really inconvinient for Guild Battles and stuff. 2. Even though the devs tried to solve the issue, it's still an issue. The stronger the monsters, the more broken it is. Unisoning in Guild Battles is still broken as such. Please continue to resolve the issue!",
            "The game is pretty nice. The customization feels great and streamlined; easy to learn. One critique is that with more money, you can easily progress faster than everyone around you, akin to the problem Clash of Clans has. The gameplay feels nice and natural; along with the fun guild battle system. If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to customize the party you quest with. I.E. Choosing whether or not to allow other CPU's to come with you. Overall, great game, fun time."

            "This game used to be amazing when it first came out, now it is outdated as the developers have failed to conserve the player experience, with the game being infested with hackers, and oversaturated with ridiculous armor perks that wouldn't be accepted in any competitive game. All we see now is new content alongside no balance changes. This game is screaming for a sequel.",
            "Really, I spent much money on this game, but I can't get my purchases back ? Why is that ? I don't know if this is possible, but check my Google pay history. It's littered with this game. So please, can I have most or all of my items back ? Thanks",
            "I honestly love the game, it has smooth gameplay, rewards are fair, and easy controls. The reason why I gave three stars is multiplayer mode, the matching is unfair. I'm just level 18 and my enemies are in level 43, 65, 58, etc... I hope you guys can have a better match making like making players with the same levels battle just to be fair. So I hope you guys can do that someday.",
            "Very fun! But if you are looking for a game that can save your progress, this is not it, I almost reach the max lvl and bought so many real money items, but sadly I can't load my progress to a new devices,I spend so many real money,but I can't get it back, my old device is broken and I can't load my progress to my new phone, please add account or make it so we can save our progress by connecting to Google play games, this game is very fun to be honest, but it's not perfect yet, saves will do it",
            "I dont like how I try to play multiplayer and end up getting matched with players with a lot higher combat rating. I almost always get killed with a single shot or at the very least very easily. If you were to start playing this game from scratch, it isnt worth it. Needs immediate improvement. Place low level players with low level players and high level players with high levels."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "Honestly, I've played this game before, so I got it again, only to be disappointed. Whenever I create (or try to) my viking, it stops at the name and says there is a problem registering my viking. Other people are having this issue, but I will keep the game and see if it's resolved soon. Jumpstart Games, fix your game, please.",
            "It's overall a good game that I can spend my time on, but there are a lot of issues that makes many people frustrated. The infamous Battle Event glitch keeps appearing and it sucks. Also, stop changing the Battle Event rewards for the events. I just want to farm gems without engaging in the event, but it forces me to get candy instead. Events should be, well, an event that gives players an option to engage in it or not. Thawfest was the reason why I kept the game uninstalled for months.",
            "It has been awesome playing this game and I love it !!!!!!! I'm glad that you fixed the wild dragon disappearing thing !! But .....I can't do like ....anything ! Cuz you have to pay money for gems and you can't do anything if you don't have gems ! I'd love it if you made there be less coin spending on the new quests and stuff like that !! Please do !!",
            "This game is great.... except that the chat system is awful (the chat is a tad bit too censored and you could get banned for a simple mistake, even though they don't even tell what you said wrong, they just tell you that you said something wrong), the graphics aren't the best, but not the worst, and the controls (especially for decorating the farm) are kinda terrible. But, I suppose it is somewhat decent if you look past the issues. Also, the teen dragons are very glitchy and broken.",
            "It's a fun game overall, but it's also a Pay-to-Win game. You either have to spend money on memberships or gems to do any of the fun quest, or grind for months. I have a membership account and it gets boring because theres no quests until a big update. You should add daily quest to level up your dragons, or just to do something fun. And I also get constantly get \"Logged Out\" of the game. Please fix that. And the chat is horrible. I can't say Hi or I get muted. But overall, it's a decent game."

            "The game decides today, 22 Oct 2020, that from now on, instead of ads, I have to use gems to buy a spin after a loss on a level. But of course, I don't have any gems and gems cost real money. And, there's no way to earn gems through game play, so no more free spins! We'll see what happens from here, but I may be deleting this game.",
            "Good game. Few things I didnt like was it forces me to use my extra help options on the beginning of the game. Or even forces me to use boost energy at the start when I dont even need it! They only give you three gems so you would buy the boost energy but it costs 6 gems!! I tried to end game so that I wouldnt have to buy it with my gems. But then it forces you to use your gems to continue. Level 24.",
            "Please add the new features in the next update of the game, game data save with social accounts and improvements on UX design like the main lobby display with the fresh new look! And one more thing please add more characters in this game. Next, please label the game levels with colourful background with difficulty indicator on the level number for example, no indicator for easy levels, skull indicator for hard levels and horned skull indicator for super hard levels just like Candy Crush Saga do",
            "After progressing to a certain level, the game gives you colours that you can't use to complete the level. You also don't have enough balls, sometimes by just 1/2 short of what you need. If these problems aren't resolved, I feel to delete the game due to it's frustrating set up!",
            "This game used to be fun. Now I am forever stuck on level 644, because you are only given 25 balls. It is impossible to pass this level with only 25 balls. Help on you tube show 37 balls. You can pass with 37 balls. Fix the game. Fix level 644. Is there any support anymore for this game? Are there to be anymore updates? If not, why?"

There is a significant lack of pressure to adhere to a particular course or even to buy premium (making me personally feel far more willing to subscribe to be honest). This app feels like it genuinely created to support people rather than for financial gain - which is something you rarely see nowadays. All in all, this app places meditation in the hands of the user, but provides freedom within it's supportive direction. Useful both for the beginner and the experienced.",

            "Just my type of game. Doesn't heavily rely on p2w status that heavily(yet?). Devs are pretty generous. Edit: sad to say, I have to lower the score to 3 star now. Right now, CP wars is horrible. No cash, no cp. But i understand that it's how the game get its profits. Arena, is not worth it anymore. It has become an endless grind. Not really that bad, but there's something missing. Contents, we need contents to keep players, be it P2W or F2P.",
            "I have th PC version and the mobile version, its just as good on mobile, it runs so nice and smoothly on the phone. When it first came out I had game bugs that gave me a big disadvantage, but now I have restarted the game on a new phone and the game has improved alot since then. Sadly I lost my characters but I was able to catch up really quickly and better than before.",
            "I don't like this game but i'm addicted to it. May be i got brain washed. The reality in this game is you can become stronger by spending money. You can enjoy the game w/o spending too much but once you play this game, mark my word, u'll definitely find a way to spend some to get stronger if you want to. I just put 3 stars because once u get disconnected, you will need to restart the game before you can play again and its really annoying when it happen while u're about to finish the merchantry.",
            "Generally really fun. This latest update though has me stuck in a loop where it says it needs updated. But i have it updated to the latest version in the store. So it keeps sending me back to the store then back to the game then back to the store when there is no additional update? Update 10/29/20 they once again updated the game and made it unavailable to android users. Its a waste of money on this game when they continously update it and make it unavailable for days on end. Down to 1 star",
            "At first release it was good . But now it's heavily pay to win. It becomes a slot machine game. So to new players I'll warn you it's to late for you guys to catch up on the game.you need to spend your entire life savings just to catch up with players if your only a casual player well it's to late there no content for you here the game contents is only for people who spent so much on this game to enjoy it. I'm telling you f2p way here it just a bluff. Save your precious time on something else"

            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

            "This game has a lot of potential but after a while it gets quite boring. Don't you think that when you have the buttons with the stripes an the arrows that if you merge them together you could clear the board or some type of explosion that adds points to your score. Come on people use your imagination we all have one. If I come up with something as simple as the explosions with the straight buttons I'm sure you could come up with something a lot better since you're supposed to be the experts",
            "I've always enjoyed this type of connect games and, to me, this is probably the best one out there. You can spin a wheel once a day for free to win bombs, scissors, ect. to help if needed. Youcan use gems to buy spins and it's very easy to get gems. There's no limit to how many times you can spin the wheel as long as you have gems which is great!Some levels are difficult but you can always get extra time if you watch a 5 to 30 second ad. Try it. It's a great game!",
            "My \"go to\" game for winding down and chilling out. Rarely do I find myself frustrated, and the ads are tolerable and, quite often, convenient! My teenager laughs at my longevity/commitment.....Level 1141 and climbing! There's just so many spots waiting to be connected!!! ...................... Side note: I usually keep my volume off while I play, but sometimes I thoroughly enjoy listening to the spots ‚òÜ \"PoP\"!‚òÜ when connected........and the fireworks! ü§£ü§≠ü§ì",
            "I don't like that you run out of gems so fast and that you only get 2 free ones when u watch an ad its just to much work to keep pressing the button and watching ads over and over again just for two gems.. I think we should get more gems and more time on the clock.",
            "Please help! When playing a game, after a few minutes, everything freezes and can't make anymore moves.... do i perhaps need to do an update or something? Love the game and don't want to start from the beginning again. All help will be appreciated Thank you."

Otherwise it's a great game due to graphics and everything and I've had decent enough luck because the luck is randomized so people shouldn't be complaining for not getting a feautured hero from non guaranteed summons, that's their fault.",
            "Ive been playing this game for about 4 o years now and im still playing this game after 4 years. So its good enough to keep my interest for about half a decade i think that definitely deserves 5 stars. I see a lot of comments complaining about summon rates but i think its just unlucky people who are mad at their luck. I usually get atleast one fetured hero in the period of how long the featured summon lasts and there is always a garuteed summon after so many tries ive got more than i can lvl",
            "Worst rates in any summons I've ever seen. Despite pity summons I still never get the hero I want and on the best banners I never get anything and no pity. I love this game but I'm done with it until money-team fixes their game. Red grade basically money locked so arena is useless now since all the cash shoppers automatically win due to gold frames. I am sick of it and just making a statement about it. AVOID THIS GAME.",

            "Gameplay is beautifully simple, fun, and above all else, relaxing. This game was doing so well at being a calming game with super great sound design and music. This, however, was conpletely ruined by specific ads. I'm all for free games having ads, but if you are marketing a chill relaxing game with good music, maybe blacklist certain ads. It's fine to have popups or quiet videos, but if i'm trying to relax and out of nowhere it goes \"AUDIBLE\" at the top of their lungs, its very jarring.",
            "Played it years ago as a way to kill time, reinstalled again recently. Still as good as I remembered it. Not much changed: it's still the same straightforward puzzle game. It has its challenging moments which get rid of the occasional tedium, but overall is fun. I think a good casual way to enjoy it is to finish five to ten sets a day.",
            "Great game! 3 stars because of the ads. Way too many ads. You're in the vibe with the music and all, then an ad kicks in. Come on! I understand you gotta make some money, but the ads kinda kill the mood. How about making a paid version without ads? This is a game I'd pay for.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "To be honest a lot of post on here about the game(mobile strike) being pay to win is pretty much 80% acurate there are some times your base is better but then there comes the dude that spent $20 more than you and just claps all your troops the game has alot of potentail but is already a failing game just becuase the game devs just want so extra money. So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",
            "Cost to much ti play i have been playing this game for years i spent alote of money on it and the change up to cyber we that were playing before that had to spend much more and the stuff we bought before we cant even use even the game packs have alote of stuff but there is 80%of it is stuff u cant use note that we should have renberse use for what we paid for and lost cause of the change up",

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!üò¢ This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

For example, you used to be able to pick up an enemies gun by just being close to it, now you have to be on top of a weapon just to pick it up and they made throwing a knife harder, used to get 10 knife kill per match! It's a decent game! My 1st 2 to 3 years of playing this game i had it rated @ 5 ‚≠ê's but now that they made these unnecessary changes, I dropped it down to 4‚≠ê",
            "Fun to play against people who might be better or as good as me, very competitive but fun. I enjoy seeing new items in the seasons shop comes out because of the accessories and weapons. Its a vs game as we know however I like to play to win most of the time. The controls are simple and over time its gets better because of playing so much. #funtoplay",
            "I've been playing this game for years. Word of advice - Don't buy ANYTHING! I was ripped off for $27.99, and $13.99. I didn't get what I paid for, and Customer Service is ignoring me. I had no problem spending money on this game before. It's harder earning money during COVID, and I decided to spend some here only to be completely ripped off. Don't download. Play Call of Duty instead.",
            "TURN FOR THE WORSE. I've been down since day one, when it used to be fun. I get there's going to b updates and programmers will attempt to satisfy everyone's needs and desires, but as I look thru the comments it seems that most players arent happy with the gameplay. Matchmaking takes forever. Upgrades on guns are difficult to come by. The extra perks for each level of fighting is difficult to understand. It was better when it was just all guns straight up and that was it.",

The game actually feels quite easy. Controls and gameplay are alright, the graphics aren't that bad for mobile, and the items are that busted. All around, it's a solid FPS pick on mobile."

            "It gets difficult in the start, but then it gets a little more easier after a few plays. Here's a tip; When some of your people die during raids, you still have their guns with you when you get home. Trade those guns away for bullets. Bullets are the resources you really need, and don't go upgrading your gun until you have enough metal and wood. Always check your guys in the frontlines, because when people come back from raids, their places, with the original men, may change, which could kill ye",

Once you get to a certain point you basically can continue forever. But other then that, this game is excellent overall.",
            "It's a fun game and all, but it's too hard to get resources. It's too hard to get through rounds and the game is overall ass. I'm sorry but the game is WAAAAY too difficult. GG fellow gamers, but this is not a really good game."

Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You üëåüëçüíô",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 secondsü•∂üò¨üò¨ Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "I love it, I got scammed a while back in a raffle but other than that it's a really fun game. It's fun to see that it has been updated and kept alive, it does warm my heart! It's not perfect and it has flaws, such as a lot of micro transactions and all. That wouldn't be a problem if the PVE was just as good as the pvp. It would be amazing if the campaign got some love, I get that it's a farming zone for materials. But it would be really exciting to see some more chapters and more pve content.",
            "Really Good Game I really enjoy playing as you can replay characters to gain more coins if you don't want to spend actual money purchasing coins and notes. This is fun to play since it has maturity of the South Park characters like Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters and etc. If you keep struggling you can replay a old level. Enjoy this game since I enjoy watching South Park. Hope to see more things added to this game in the future. Good work.",
            "I've loved this game up until level 12, number 59! It keeps messing up and wont play right. The 1st castle guy wont die or show his health bar. It will just keep going on and on even when I have every card playing. Please fix this. Also I've spent so much money on this game & I thought the updates was supposed to help that. It hasn't! Last thing I'll b@&%h about is the pvp matchup is very unfair. Esp. when I'm not even level 4 & u match me with others who are way higher. I just dont get that!",
            "I give this game five stars because the graphics are great. One thing I really admire about this game is the character selection. They have so many people to collect and upgrade. As some one who really loves South Park it's good to know that they still keep the creativity and negativity, I thank everyone who created the show and this amazing game.",
            "KICK A**! I see all these negative comments, but it looks as though the game has been updated and fixed. And you don't have to spend actual money on this game to have fun, they give you so many options to earn what you need to upgrade your cards, earn money and C points and more. But you guys who complain are the younger generation from me. You don't understand games like I do. Im the keyboard cowboy...ironic name, hu? Lol anyways Creators, just wanna say thnx. But mostly to Matt & Trey."

            "I love Dragons, so this is very enjoyable for me. Still learning the game only level 86 i think, so still a lot to do to master the game. Update 10/16/2020 I am now over level 110 my dragons are getting stronger and accomplishing more in the gane, it just keeps getting better and better. Definitely worth 5 star rating and if it were possible 10 star. Keep up the great work everyone!!",
            "I'd rate this game 5‚≠ê, but everytime I try to watch an ad (for extra rewards), it keeps saying \" No ads available \" , then after about 3 minutes of try to get the ad to play, the game crashes, and have to wait another 2 minutes for the game to load again...If this issue gets fixed I'll change my review to 5‚≠ê, but as it currently is, the game is practically unplayable. (Suggestion: if there's no ad available, you could have it auto give the rewards. Rather than having the game constantly crash.)",
            "This is an awesome game with fantastic graphics! The game play is easy to learn and use. I like that the dragons look lifelike versus other games where the dragons look more like a cartoon. I only gave 4 stars because you can't use a dragon's special weapon until a certain criteria has been reached in the game, which I haven't been able to reach yet.",
            "I've been planning this for a couple of months now and I find it fun and easy to play even though I cannot buy anything with cash because Google locked me out of my account. It's super addictive and got some of my friends and family to start playing too. I only need to spend about 20 minutes or so 3 or 4 times a day and I in the top 40% of the server.",
            "Extremely fun BUT... one of the most expensive games if you want to try to support the devs. If things were cheaper I'd actually spend some money, but 25 + a month for auto play and no adds... no one time purchase options. 30+ for battle passes... The high prices forced a bad rating for a great game. I will probably search for another game to support. Dropped to a 1 star, legion chat always disappears leaving you with no idea about who has asked questions or anything. Pathetic devs."

            "Nice game make me feel better when I was stressed it's better if you add some more musics each music has its unique way. Only problem is sometimes the music is stopping while I'm playing so please rectify this problem as soon as possible. Thank you ‚ù§",
            "Very fun. Slightly different than other rhythm games but very high quality. Good song fidelity as well. Sounds great on a audiophile sound setup and even good on budget audio equipment as well. All around fun game if rhythm games are your style and worth investing in if you enjoy the gameplay.",
            "It's a brilliant story with nice graphic and amazing music. But I just really wish you didn't have to pay to complete the story. You can't go any further into the plot unless you pay money for the full version.",
            "I have some problem. With the latest update, it can't be played because when trying to play some song, the sound is glitchering and beatmap is offset. Please fix this",

            "Wow. I am hooked. Since I started playing this game early on in the lockdown I got two of my buddies hooked as well. The game helps me build analogies to two story telling (the journey of the colour dots, their character arcs and what not) and strangely I can see parallels to approaching life as the relationship between various dots that occupy every spot on the board.",
            "I have played this game for years. There is a wide variety of levels of different diffculties, shapes and sizes. Game works on a variety of different devices; phones and tablets. Highly recommend as a casual game to help pass some time. At the bmv? Flow. Long line in a store? Flow. Passenger on a long car ride? Flow. Bored with current level set? Go to a different level set, BOOM, continue Flowing. You can Flow anywhere, anytime. I love this game ‚ù§",
            "I absolutely love this game! It's addicting to me. I've played every board, made sure every level was a perfect play, including all the extra packs I unlocked. I really wish there were some new packs for this game. I used to play this game for hours when I was bored. I miss all the nights where it would keep me up at night in bed while my phone was illuminated with Flow. I could think clearly because there were no distractions in bed. The only medal I need to get is the 365 day player goal.",
            "Such a fun and sometimes challenging game. I can and have spent hours playing this game. It's an excellent time killer, and it's really entertaining. I have completed all the levels, and restarting it felt like an entirely new experience. I could go on forever about the variety of levels and how much I enjoy this game, but I won't. Just trust me when I say that I you're into fun and interesting puzzle games, you'll probably like this one! üòÄ",
            "I love this game, and I have been playing it for years. One thing is that it's great to pass time or just listen to music but still have something to do with your hands. I have the full version, so I'd love it if paid and free packs were uploaded every once in a while (but kind of frequently because you can get through them pretty fast). I know there are other versions with more packs, but I don't want to pay more for every full version. :)"

        "comments": [
            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think ¬£50 for 30 minutes and ¬£100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like ¬£49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. ¬£99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for ¬£70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "Without a doubt, this game is fun & a brain changer. However, rebooting the game sfter every play is pathetic to say the least. For that reason I am considering un-installing, which I did. Now, 7 months later I thought I would give it a try once again. Nothing has been done to improve the situation. Seems like it worse than before. This time it is good-bye forever.",
            "Love this game! Trivia is my favorite. Challenging questions and not much time to answer!! The tiles offered are really cool, as are the rewards when you win. Puzzles are challenging, too. Overall, game keeps my mind sharp! ***OH, one change I really appreciate is during trivia. When you can't answer in time, the game now shows you the answer before closing out. That used to drive me nuts not knowing the right answer for next time. Thanks for updating!***",
            "Fun word game. Coins (which you can buy with real money) get you very little. I wish you could buy hints with them. I paid for ad-free but I still am asked way too often if I want to purchase coins - no, and stop asking, thanks. Recent updates made the daily game clearer. They added a little bee to help out. It's annoying, and covers part of the puzzle.",
            "Falsely advertised as a different game; plus all extra words gained in piggy bank has to be Bought back by me!..for 3.99- you must be kidding; then I have to advertise on other social media to promote this game!?.. for supposed extra coins! I am totally disappointed...where is the original game that was advertised for choosing the correct word that sound the same but have different meanings?",
            "It was advertised on trivia crack as a grammar game. I love grammar and when I saw that advertisement for choosing different words with same sounds and you had to choose which one would be correct in the sentence, I didn't miss a beat to install. Then when I opened it, it was just the basic word cookies, or swipe to get the words. It's falsely advertised. Uninstalled right away. It also was pushing you to spend money so even if you do like this sort of game, I don't reccommend this version."

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",
            "Was running fine & progressing nicely until it tried to force me to accept a Facebook policy, I cannot accept the cookies as screen won't drag to press accept as screen size has changed, so it means I'm no longer able to send help/ items to friends or ask for help with reports at the end of each case, also feeding pets has changed to adverts only which now takes forever....really disappointed & frustrated so please change it back to 5 min timers & cut the excessive adverts for everything"

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "This is supposed to be fun, not frustrating or leaving you feeling like you've been ripped off. The new update has changed the payouts on all the games of chance. Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. üòçüòáüòÅüòÅ",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "I actually enjoyed this, even though I got to two days before finishing and then was stuck as didn't have enough officers (no option to go back a few days had to start from scratch) is a fun diversion but doesn't get a higher score as your actions in the game don't seem to matter to the final story other than very topline stuff. A lot of what you do is painted as important but doesn't affect the outcome.",
            "Too slow and boring, plus it's in landscape mode which is not a natural way to hold a phone, there are tons of excellent potential 5 star games out there that make the mistake of using landscape mode at the very least make both modes so there is at least a choice..",
            "I thought the story was interesting and the game has a lot of character overall, but the gameplay is kind of frustrating. You're constantly asked to make decisions with only limited context, where there's really no way to know what choice will lead to what outcome. As a result, when you choose \"wrong\" and get a bad result, it doesn't feel like you screwed up, it feels like the game screwed you. Maybe that's what they're going for, sometimes you make a call with your gut and it's the wrong one and people die, but in a game that's just frustrating.",
            "Very different from most games I've played on my phone, when I started I thought I was just going to be a tell police go to go here and go there, but it turns out there's a very good storyline, and a pretty dispatch system in management. Overall a very enjoyable game and much better then excited.",
            "Meh, it's okay, id rather a sandbox mode as well as the story, it's a bit boring but it's a well made game and that's why it's three stars."

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

Not a single purple or yellow besides the one they gave for free. Quite sad to of spent money for literally nothing. I know it's all chance, but I personally wont be attempting this again.",

Please fix this its terrible and straight up ruins the game for me. Ill delete this post and give back my 5 stars once this is resolved.",
            "The game is beautiful, i've playing for a long time now. But today is different. After i open the app and tap to start, it went pitch black and never showing the game. Please fix this, and i will give you back my 5 star",
            "I dont usually do reviews so I'll keep it short because this company deserves something for its hard work and after playing for almost two years this game is probably had one of its biggest updates just recently so its clear that they really do care about this game and want to keep it revelant and entertaining, and I really mean that despite sounding like a review bot."

            "Good relaxing game but a lot of the challenges are on repeat or have multiple of the same ones. Currently on advanced level and keep seeing the same puzzles over and over again with each one i do. Wish there were larger more complicated ones with more variety. Its a bit too easy and a little boring. Still helps when im having anxiety though.",
            "This game is amazing!! But there is a flaw, the ads ughh! Its really really annoying . But this game would be a perfect game without the ads l tried to turn off my internet but the game cannot play without the internet.On the another side you should try it,or tell others about this game because it is awesome,amazing and wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!BYEüíëüíÉüòªüíëüíëüíë",
            "It's cool and relaxing, but the ads can be annoying. Hopefully, it's just 1$. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz of the sound effect when you win a level. Early levels are a breeze but it gets very annoying. A relaxing game should have a relaxing sfx not an overused indie win sfx. Either that or complete silence. I like the sound of the blocks touching each other but the win? So unfitting. And you can't turn off that specific sound. It's all or nothing. Smh",
            "The ads aren't really too bad. Unless there's been changes since some of the old reviews, you're looking at 1 ad every 3-4 levels (which can be skipped after 5 seconds) The game itself is a nice, satisfying mental workout. A good time killer and a bit addicting. Controls are fluid and intuitive, the difficulties are categorized properly, the quest for optimal solves is great. This is a hidden gem.",
            "Good puzzle game . I play when I have a bit of mild anxiety and it helps me concentrate. There isn't many ads at all so I don't get annoyed with that . Overall it's a 10/10 peaceful game . For free I have no complaints at all . Thanks."

            "Ugh! Why do you guys always insist on \"improving\" EVERYTHING? What's wrong with just leaving a great game alone? I used to LOVE this puzzle game and had given it 5 stars but then you went and tried to \"improve\" on an already perfect app. Now there's constant lagging, you took away the ability to set pieces on the game board under the puzzle, you took away the \"move in\" \"move out\" option as well as other options. Please let us go back to how it was before. It was just fine as it was.",
            "At the moment I only play with 64 pieces, but I am over 80 and get a thrill on completion. I get through several a day. Since the update, it has become rubbish. After it stops working, which is often, it no longer returns you to the puzzle at the point at which you left off, it takes you back to the beginning - so frustrating. For me, it is ruined.",
            "Since you updated the Ap. It's been awful. Used to be able to see everything on one page, now it's only six. Got so p.off I uninstalled, and then reinstalled, now it's not only huge pieces but can't find 'edges' button to start the game properly . I also lost all the games I had completed. when will I go into my puzzles see only the one for today! NOT HAPPY JAN! Will look elsewhere, got to be something better out there.",
            "USE to love this game, since last update it sucks!Having the past months totally opened takes up too much room!The way it was before where we had to tap on the month to open it was better! The square to put pieces on keeps jumping around when I try to adjust size to lock. The pieces won't lock on the square without multiple times moving pieces & finally it will stick. Don't know why you needed to update EVERYTHING please put things back how they were! If it aint broke dont fix it!I miss my fun!",
            "Not sure what has happened with the last update. The pieces are more difficult to stick on the board now. I have to move the piece several times across the same spot on the board before it locks in place. It's so annoying. Also the board moves around too much to play without locking it in place. Please put it back the way it was and I'll glad Restore the 5 star rating!"

        "version": "5.0.0",
        "recentChanges": "- We‚Äôve got two extra-special events in this version! Fa-boo-lous Halloween and the Sweet Surprise Event! Spend the first with the most spook-tacular dragons of Dragonia, then let the second whisk you away on a romantic adventure - plus, don‚Äôt miss the chance to collect these ultra-unique items and creatures!",
        "comments": [
            "Fun game. If there are ads, I never noticed them... completely unobtrusive. And you can literally play for years without spending a penny of real money. The only downsides for me was the ultimate boredom in trying to get the last few spaces on the board, it takes too long. And the weekend events, while giving great rewards, will take nearly every minute of your weekend days to complete. I finally gave up trying to finish the game and uninstalled, but I would recommend giving it a go.",
            "I really enjoy playing the game (only reason why I gave 3 stars), however it keeps coming out of the game and forgetting my progress. Also, things get expensive the further in you go, and I've only been playing it for less than a week! Today by forgetting my progress, it lost me some treasures I would have used to get dragon eggs, which is the only way to advance the game. Ads take me out of the game. Ultimately I'm frustrated with the game and am considering finding something else üò¨üòí‚òπÔ∏èüò°üòü",
            "The camp economy needs redone. I have to pay gems for everything I work for, and what I receive is not valuable. I opened a level 5 chest, and only received 145 coins and nothing else. The two stars are only there because of the memories when I played this years ago. I know you guys can improve. I don't want to have to switch to a different merge game. P.S. Accidents are fatal. For example, when you're going for a high level item and then merging 3 objects instead of 5.",
            "Such a great game! Graphics are amazing and it's great puzzling fun. One suggestion I have is to make a lock or pinned feature for objects, so they're not as easy to move around if you don't want them to. I also suggest some kind of warning or countdown for when the special events are ending. I like to collect everything at the end, and I tend to lose track of time. I didn't get anything I worked hard for for three days... so annoyed, and it's my own fault but wow. A little notice would be nice",
            "This is a good game to sink time into when nothing else is going on. What I don't like is that purple stars are imposible to get unless you spend real money. I haven't had a purple star drop in more than two months... And I can't justify the cost to buy the gems with real money. It would be nice to have a trade option to purchase the gems with things earned through game play. I'm stuck on some quests because of this \"feature.\""

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.üôèüôè",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "I love this game and play along...I would rate a 5 but they could do a better job with explaining things...and having races that would help finish the cars you have ... I am stuck because I can't get components...",
            "Pretty good game and it's not completely pay to win. Only big issue for me is recently it won't load me into the game. Only fix I've found is uninstalling and reinstalling the game for it just to work for a few hours. Only started a few days ago so hopefully it gets fixed. It first started when I customized a car and it kicked me out. EDIT - Changed to 5 stars because the issue got resolved and no longer does it.",
            "This is a fun and exciting game. But my frustration comes from the inability to get some cars needed for events. Everytime there is an event, it requires me to purchase the car with an asinine amount of money. The game doesn't even afford me the option of spending in-game currency to purchase these elite cars. My only options are spending $20 for 1 car or trying to get it by the rare imports which is impossible. The only key you can use to get a car is a gold key and even then it only component.",
            "After playing this game for a couple of months, I started to enjoy it, playing 20-30 mins each day up until I could not get into my account, every time I tried to get my save data from the cloud it would just start a fresh one. Contacted support, and the reply was\"we are aware of this issue, wait for the next update\"2,3 weeks later still no update,I will not wait months on end just to be able to play a game. The good thing is that I didn't spend any money on it or I would have regretted it."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

BUT...... microtrasaction are out of this world. 50 bucks for a 30 days subscription and so on. if you want to be competitive and don't mind spending hundreds of dollars, you can play this. Ps. you can get some stuff for free, but you are going to spend hours watching ads. Example to get a free ship you have to watch over 40 mins of ads to unlock it.",

After the latest update several of my ships and side guns can no longer be selected. Inworked really hard to get the money and gems and what not for those ships and upgrades. What happened to take them away? I would give 5 stars because i love the game that much. But taking all my ships? My wakanda ship? Wth? Edit: Fixed within a day!!",
            "I absolutely love this game, I play it 24/7, But I'm confused as to Why all of a sudden it's not allowing me to play due to a pop up saying, TimeOut!!!!, May someone please tell me what is wrong, I brought in over 30 friends to download this game an they don't see it but me..They are all wanting to delete it like myself may I please have an explanation as to why it's saying this ONLY on the partners section onlyü§îü§îü§îü§î"

With the help of Emma's Adventures tech I no longer have problems. I unplugged my router for about three minutes then plugged it back in. After getting back online, everything is running smoothly. In the future, I'll unplug and see if thar fixes the problem before driving the tech crazy with all my messages to them for help.",
            "I like the challenges and how you build up your town the way you want it . I have been playing this game for a while now and still like it but 2 major issues . The ships that come in you should have the same option as the train to let it go even if you haven't filled it . The guild is not great most of the time its too hard to help people compared to other games such as township in that game being part of a guild is what makes the game fantastic. a few changes would make it fun and enjoyable.",
            "So far the best game I have played from play store. I have not spent any money. I am level 53. They always add more content to keep playing. Not everyone will like this game because we are all different. Most people will find it just fine. It is not a pay to play game but if you like it...you can support the developers by buying things if you wish to. I have received no compensation for this review nor do I want it. This is a great game!",
            "Very slow. Not able to advance as quick as I would like to. Stuck on home, going around the crops and animals, since started. Unable to go to other areas without getting stuck. !!!!! Has improved a lot. / Hate it when it goes off while playing at a good moment..... One problem is as I am working on this game, it switches off. So frustrating üò° . How long will I have to put up with this?",
            "I really like this game but the further you progress in the game, the more energy points it takes to do anything. You spend all your time filling orders just to kill time until you have enough energy to actually play the levels. And then you only have enough energy to clear a bush or two and then wait for an hour. Clear a bush, wait an hour. It becomes far too tedious to want to continue."

            "I HATE games that force you through an extremely slow tutorial without the option to open settings. I'm listening to my audiobook and have been tapping for 20 minutes and still there is no option to turn off the sound. It's also incredibly dumb that you can't tap tap and upgrade at the same time, and there is no \"buy max\" button. This tutorial is going on forever, I hate being railroaded by a game Edit: apparently the railroading never stops. Uninstalling",
            "It keeps you busy at night and it's just a game to keep you distracted when you need it in the game you save up money and you tap to Rainbow and the more you tap the more buildings you can buy the house gets upgraded it's really fun and I've already playing it for 2 hours",
            "Wants to give us random ads during play but when it comes time for ads to double prizes like being offline for 9 hours and double that income suddenly ads no longer will load and you lose the double income. Had daily reward and went to watch ad to exchange only to get no reward at all",
            "I don't know why there's no close button after spinning for an advisor. I tapped all over the screen and nothing happens and basically you're forced to close the app and restart after every spin because there's nothing else you could do."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

Now they added this stupid help others, instead of adding levels.",

If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "This game is a lot of fun. You build amazing gardens as you pass different levels. But besides that it has a great interactive feature. You can turn on all your street lights and lanterns thru out your gardens, change plants and statues and benches to give each garden a totally different look. I could go on and on. If there are any draw backs it would be getting stuck on some levels for to many days. That gets very frustrating. Overall a really fun way to spend your time",
            "Its actually relaxing. I see everyone commenting about the difficulty. It happens, but too me that's the point. Why would anyone want too play an easy game. I like my mind being massaged and 4 that reason, I will never quit. I'm on level 1850 something. I lost count. Lol. I do agree at times with winning more, but at other times because of my consistency, I get rewarded a lot of boosters too stay in the game. Use them wisely. Create your own strategy and you'll get ahead. Good luck everyone!",
            "Actually pretty fun. Glad I finally tried it after being bombarded with ads. Still don't know how they monetize this game...I've played as much as I want without being prompted to pay for anything. Graphics good even if storyline is a bit corny. UPDATE: ok...NOW I know how they make coin! They get some $10/month or so from me now. I'm hooked & too often stay up far too late \"just to win one more time.\" The deals can be pretty fair though, and I'd like to think playing keeps dementia at bay :)",
            "You know if you wanna win, you gotta have some tricks.. I'm sorry Gardenscapes, but I have to help them folks... Tricks to beat some level... 1. If you had played for several weeks but can't move up a level, try not to log in for a few days... After that long period, try logging in, and see what Austin have in store for you.. I mean, free gift... üòÖ 2. Try to create as many boosters as you can then if you're lucky those boosters might sit next to each other then you can make a huge blast!",
            "Fun game. If you want to burn some time, it's not bad. A puzzle game with quests. You literally advance to harder puzzles by doing quests. Still playing after 800 levels. It gets harder and you will need more specials like bombs and rainbow wheels to get past the Super Hard levels or you will start to get frustrated as you will need luck on these maps more so than skill."

            "Very very very very slow. I only need to complete two birds and six dinosaurs. Figured out how long it would take. Gave up. I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over ¬£200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

            "It's a really good game in my opinion. I love all the song choices and the story. The art is really cute too. I never knew that a music game would make me so happy and emotional. I really love some songs like \"Waltz in devils playground\" and \"I hate to tell you\" although, love all of the songs. I would tell other people to play this. I'm so happy this game was made. Thanks for all the hard working people who helped make this game. Also, thank you Rayark for making this lovely game.",
            "This game is incredible. By far my favourite game of its kind due to the high quality unique music, the stunning visuals and art, and the always compelling storyline. I've been playing Deemo since I first started college four years ago and have been playing it since. I listen to the music regularly, have been inspired to learn some of the songs on piano because of this game, and is in general a relaxing and fun game to play when I'm bored. By far one of the best apps I have on my phone. Period.",
            "Simple story, but the way it is told is superb. Just by the way the story is told, it's easily one of the best, if not the best rhythm game of all time. Not to mention how the soundtrack and bgm are well thought out, and fits the player's mood perfectly. The ending moved me so much I cried. Still get a heartache along with teary eyes every time I hear that one song. It's so good that it ruined my experience of other rhythm games as I can't help but find them lacking in comparison.",
            "My first DEDICATED rhythm game, and it slowly is teaching me, a beginner, to properly play and doesn't punish me for missing notes! Each and every one of the music is unique and has meaning. The story is told in a beautiful but short cutscenes, allowing us to piece the puzzle of the story together. I love it and I hope others will too!",
            "So, after few months after my last review which unfortunately was a 1 star, I can give this 5 stars again, my purchases came back and I can play again. If you like rhythm games this is the best mobile one out there. Great sound tracks, amazing challenge but with an easy start for beginners. Honestly you can't go wrong with this game."

            "Used to be 5 stars, but dropped 3 stars because of that annoying notification that never disappears. Killing the app temporarily kills this notification, but connecting a BT device makes it come back again. Been complaining about it for 6 months now. Support says they're aware of it and try to handle, but they don't, which is very lame. Think it's done on purpose.",
            "Gteat selection of radio stations, but, the ads have become too much, especially the last update, 1 hour of talk radio, with 17 minutes of commercials, way too much!! I figured this out when I was listening to a shoe end at 6:17, and I started listening to it at 5. I understand that this program is ad supported, but seriously?? I am rolling back to versio. 13.3, way less commercials!",
            "Nicely done, but one issue: even after I turn it off, TuneIn will still turn on at random times. Sometimes, it's when I get in the car and my phone establishes a Bluetooth connection. Other times, when I'm not doing anything special with Bluetooth or any streaming app. Fix that and it's five stars. OCT 2020: Still doing this. I don't use TuneIn every time I get in my car!",
            "I would NEVER sign up for a free trial of premium right now as I'm struggling financially. Must be a 1 button sign up, because some how I accidently was signed up...of course didnt know it until a month later they hit my empty bank account for 100 dollars. I ask within a week for a refund as it was an honest mistake and my family needs this money right now and I'm told they will not issue me a refund because its past 48 hours. Really?! Thanks, cant pay bills but got premium radio! Aholes....",
            "For weeks now, the app keeps stopping every few seconds to few minutes when casting to my Google Home. It just happened again as I was writing this review. I tried to submit a report through the app, but the email bounced. I primarily use the app for listening to news, and it's worthless when it goes out in the middle of a sentence. UPDATE: I think it's getting worst... It plays the commercials, then stops. If it actually ever plays the news, it only plays for a few seconds. Update: fixed."

            "I think the developers are bored with this game. They seem to just be spewing out rehashes of levels and the only updates appear to be efforts to wind back rewards and get as much money as they can out out of players before they cut and run. From a good game to one of the most boring in a few updates. Got a few months free play then zip, uninstall. Don't bother, money grubbers. Not worth it.",
            "I loved this game starting out but now that I'm in the 3000 plus levels I hardly win. The earthworm challenges are almost impossible to beat. Theres some fun little challenges but unless you can beat at least 10 levels you dont get the rewards. Be ready to spend a lot of money to buy gold to be able to beat levels. I've been playing since 2017 but I haven't hardly played in the last couple weeks. Probably gonna be uninstalling it very soon. Feels like more work than fun anymore",
            "This game has become unplayable without buying gold. I'm on level 3650. You can spend hours doing one level which is boring. If they added one move each time you failed a level it wouldn't be too bad, but you have to fail numerous times before a move gets added. The league tables are a joke as well , instead of being called the \"Championship of Great Britain\" it should be called the \"Championship of Who Can Afford the Most Gold\". I used to love this game to the point of obsession, not now tho'.",
            "It's a really fun, cute puzzler and the challenge is good. However I disagree with some of the micro transaction tactics. Constantly being left at the end of a level being 1 move short due to the RNG of the blocks dropping from the top where you need them to line up is very frustrating and you are tempted to buy extra moves with real money which I disagree with. The fiend styles are pretty cool though and are maybe worth buying to support the game. Not extra moves!",
            "OMG, you keep changing how the game scores making it harder to earn points. Stop changing how points are earned. After 3 years of playing, I'm about to quit. I play games for fun and pleasure, not to be fustrated by playing a level repeatedly that can't be skipped. I'm going on a long break from this game. Hopefully you make it fun again when I come back. Also, File size is getting too big."

            "I really like this editing app. It has lots of features and I have found it mostly easy to use. I have used other editing apps but always come back to this one. It would be a great feature in this app to be able to save, search, or favorite certain presets... like the preset texts. Overall, Great App. Good job. Plus, thanks for all the cool things available with this app for free.",
            "This app is really easy to use, and has a lot of options to choose from when editing photos from various filters, to effects. There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",
            "Bestest ever... Amazing app with ennumber of filters & effects. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it! my all time favorite app. Easy to use and very impressive and the great part is that its almost add free. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

I tried to attach every option that is offered and the app wouldn't let me. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. There's is no proper customer service set up. I finally found a number that would keep me on hold then eventually hang up. This is why I prefer uber, I never have these problems with them.",

But now that my address is up to date, i still have to use a completely different card. I contacted support who told me my card wasnt working or they dont accept it _. I tried explaining it was my address, they sent me to a link that told me I need to use a new card. Its just very frustdrating. I gave it two stars because the drivers are always awesome and the prices are fair.",

Dishonest, unreliable, do not use if your ride is a necessity. Unbelievable. 0 stars if I could"

            "I've played this for about a year. It's very addictive. Only reason I will not give 5 stars is because of the adverts. Although this game does not thrust adverts at you after every level like some games do, you can optionally watch an advert to get a boost. Only problem is with some adverts they start forcing you to install another app/game, or sometimes the adverts freeze, or sometimes they cause the game to restart, they have even caused the phone to reboot. This is not good.",
            "Been playing this game for a couple of years now. I like how the daily rewards don't reset if you miss a day. I love that there is always something to do. Standard mines, event mines and the mainland. It would be nice if the prestige for the standard mines wasn't so expensive. I've only managed to prestige 2 mines in 2 years although I do spend most of my time on the event mines to be fair. Nice game to spend some time on. I like how you can upgrade your miners too.",
            "The game is fun enough, but I gave it 1 star for two main reasons. The game has recently started asking me to rate it at _least_ once a day. This is incredibly annoying, but here's your review. The other reason is that I was just offered the \"no-ads\" offer for $15, and coincidentally the game now freezes nearly every time I click on an ad for a boost. I keep having to exit the game, try to watch an ad again and hope maybe it works. I feel like maybe the two things are related. ETA: I did email.",
            "great little clicker, perfect for when you have a few minutes to spare, fast user interface and heaps of things to do, lots of freebies and a steady (if not a little slow) way to make premium credits however some of the in game purchases are fairly expensive, but honestly they're not necessary to progress in the game.",
            "The game is designed to kill time, it does that. Puzzles are my favorite, but when I'm on hold and still have to pay attention to my world this kills the time. Don't expect to be grabbed by how in depth or awesome this game isn't. Just click to fidget. Do I love it, no. Does it work as planned, yup."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "My favorite game, I literally deleted my other games because this is the only one I play now, I love it so much. Everything from how positive it is, to the perfectly fitting audio that plays. I love how simple and easy going this game is and I love how this games helps you succeed. The levels where you can locate items are super fun as well, recommending this game to everyone I know literally!!",
            "Caution. This game is really nicely crafted, very visually rich, and enjoyable to play from levels 1-10. After this, things start to go absolutely mental. There is pop-up after pop-up, harassing you about another new feature. You quickly get to a point where you're bamboozled - everything on the screen is shouting at you. This appears to be by design, hyper confusion and attention hijacking to nurture addiction. This app is nefarious and should be enjoyed only with huge restraint.",
            "Never log into Facebook. It causes you to lose the prizes from any contest you won. I had tons of things coming from a dots race and they vanished the second it connected to Facebook. Also, the game freezes and crashes a lot when watching videos to get a bonus box. You have to be patient when you open the app. It can take over five minutes to come up.",
            "Honestly was obsessed with this game for awhile, but they made a bunch of updates and now every time you view the map about four or five different windows pop up to tell you about the different games. It used to just be the daily bonus. Tired of exiting out of a bunch of stupid notifications just to be able to click on the game I want. They ruined a good thing.",
            "You get to a certain point and you can't win anything without spending money. With prices on everything else in life steadily increasing the last thing I wanna spend money on is a silly phone game. If you could just spend money once or twice, maybe no big deal. But you have to constantly spend money to get perks to help you thru the levels and clearly this is by design. It's a really cool game, and very disappointing to have to delete, but I'm just not up for money hungry games like this."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like \"Download print issue\" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
            "I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
            "Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
            "App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
            "Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless."

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "This game is insanely good!! I have an underaged account, which is very annoying because it blocks some features, but it is still the BEST game I have ever played!! The graphics are very good and the gameplay is even better! All these people that say that it is PTP (Pay To Play) are WRONG!! I am at the max level and am very good, I have never payed anything! Hope anybody who plays this game enjoys it! Thank you very much EA for making such an amazing game!",
            "I love this game. I don't spend and still enjoy it, although it is a grind, so don't expect any quick progression without spending. My one suggestion would be to have a randomized pull in the beginning that gives you a random but guaranteed character. Doesn't have to be anyone amazing. 1 or 2 star character that then makes your experience of the game unique. I know you can try and pull from a chromium card but no guarantees and gems are too valuable as f2p.",
            "The game goes out of its way to ensure you're not making any decent progress without spending huge amounts. In the first 3 1/2 years of the game, new content and characters were frequent, though in the past year or so this has seen a rapid decline. Game modes have grown stale and repetitive. Any new characters have ridiculous requirements to obtain them, we are talking 6 month to a year to unlock. The game lacks balance, leveling up/gearing characters is an endless grind with little reward.",
            "Collect Star wars characters, what more can I say. Have had the game over 2 years now and don't see myself leaving anytime soon. The game has its ups and downs, and of course there is a pay to win element, but it's in no way essential. Metas change fairly regularly and all eras of star wars are given their fair share of attention. The game also offers a great variety of game modes: Single player PVE, guild based PVE, single player PVP and guild based PVP. A fan of star wars must have this game.",
            "STAR WARS: GALAXY OF RIP OFFS. Just ok. Starts out fun, but then the game becomes total pay for play. The prices they ask are ridiculous. Supply drops r a joke since 99% of what you get, is fairly useless. No really special stuff gets dropped and updating characters & ships, unless you're willing to drop serious coin - isn't happening. The new characters are impossible to get without $. Don't bother trying to contact the developers - you'll never get an answer."

But if go in it again it works. Number 2, im kinda sad that the part-time-workers from beggar life are not there :( But otherwise everythings amazing!",
            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",
            "Amazing idle game. It's like other idle games except it has buildings to purchase. A city you can go into with multiple things to do. And not filled with a ton of ads like Alot of other games. I personally love this game and the people who made it. Well that's all. Great game.",

Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",
            "Some ads are just a picture with 0 seconds and the game thinks I did not watch an ad, so I get 0 mana (failed to view ad) Please fix! I am really enjoying the game. I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. üòÇ The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. üòÇ",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. üëç",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

            "Its... OK. The whole reason it's 2 stars instead of 3 or 4 is because of the ads. There's always ads all the time, but when you really need the ads to access the puzzles, there's always \"no ads\". And then there's the fact that you NEED to watch ads to even move forward. I mean, you can't even remove the ads. Edit: Well, you CAN, but you need to buy premium for that. And who would pay real money for this kind of game?",
            "Fun game concept but horribly overbearing monetization. Within the first 18 levels 2 require you to pay either a subscription fee or a flat 30$ for the full game. Other levels require you to watch 30 second ads to play. I figured I'd just skip these but levels are put into groups and you have to finish a set amount to unlock the next group which forces you to watch all the ads if you wish to progress \"for free\". It's just a basic phone game demanding way more money than it's worth. Just awful.",
            "I hate this game! There are levels in which we can't play them and we are forced to watch an ad to complete it for free!!!! Why can't we play those levels!!!!!!! And when I clicked on those level it showed video unavailable!!! And because of these I can't go to the another level!!!!!!! Please deal with that üò†üò†üò†üòíüòí",
            "It is a little tricky but is fun that way I read it you are for but I would make you some a little more easier for new Bergen is does like me is easy to do the the on pencil and stuff but it to watched a lot like a glitch a lot um I don't know the not to say no to say but is a fun game to play and super super super super fun thank you For the game by super friend thank you for game again",
            "I love this game vut there is just to many ads. The ads are not contatible for me so, pls remove all of the ads. Every apps always needs to pay to remove the ads. But also its quite fun andits relaxing after all. Pls downloed this app but do not downlied this app."

            "It is ok but I don't like the way you have to do a puzzle as without them you would be able to enjoy the game more. Some people do like puzzles but there should be a choice button. Also we should press on things and change it without doing puzzles not just the first few.",
            "This was actually enjoyable (too many stuffed animals for it to feel like you were designing for real), but the thing that kills it is non-consensual ads. It would be very easy for them to up the bonuses that you get for watching ads, but they decided not to go that way.",

            "I Really Like The Game. But I would change a couple of things. I would like to be able to decline picking some furniture. I don't like rugs and paintings. We picked beautiful flooring and walls and then have to cover them up. Also sometimes we pick a color scheme such as pink or lavender and then a furnishing is not the same colors. Maybe a choice of the color scheme at the beginning with the cleaning etc"

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

            "I straight up didn't install this app. I've never used it or opened it either but it was taking up lots of my battery (about 1% which is a lot for an app that I have literally never opened). I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",
            "Complete Battery Hog. I have to disable the web protection settings or it chews up my battery life in a matter of hours. According to my battery usage stats, Verizon's \"anti-virus scanner\" uses up more battery than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Mobile Games. On some days, Combined. Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "I have been a subscriber with VERIZON for about 14 yrs. I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",

Cause of this happening to people much in proving is needed to correct the problems with this app here????? Unknown if app window problem location/link & intternet problem double check from your end.",
            "Since the app was installed i cannot access my printer to print emails from my phone. This app sucks. I originally thought it was my printer now I am finding out it is my phone. I have been a Verizon customer for years. I am considering a switch to another company."

            "The Game is frequently updated to force players to spend money - alot of money - if they want to be competitive! Otherwise progress is painfully slow. With frequent updates glitches are generated which destroys enjoyment of the game. Slow the update rate down, and give the smaller castles (with little spare cash) time to catch up with the 'big boys'. If not more players will leave in droves and the kingdoms will become more stagnant than they currently are! You must prove the game environment!",
            "The game can be fun, but do not play unless you want to spend money. It requires a lot to be able to play with any kind of semblance of a chance. There are people who spend so much money that you can never ever ever ever keep up and that means you will always be dead in the water no matter what. Edit: Typical response by developer which does not address the issue which is that they encourage this behavior with the way they do updates and game play is implemented. Docked one more star.",
            "Not really a fair game for new players. Peace shields are limited and don't last long enough. Kill events literally end your passion for this game. They need to enable a join feature not an FFA. I cannot beat a kingdom of 30 when I just joined 1 week ago and am at 10. As soon as I pop shield, homophobic and racial slurs blasts the announcements. TL;DR new players gets CC'd and if you don't let others attack you, you get abused with controversial slurs. More work needed.",
            "It is absolutely awful that I've been forced to tap and follow some stupid hard to follow \"tutorial\" that isn't teaching me ANYTHING because of its poor design literally dozens of times FORCED TO TAP WHAT YOU WANT and STILL can't turn that God awful \"music\" off or the sound for that matter. This is extremely horrible and the \"story\" isn't even going at a pace or way I feel remotely like I care to be forced to tap through either. It's terrible. Really terrible.",
            "Been playing since the beginning and this game is a dumpster fire now. Constant updates that make it more more expensive and introduce more bugs than fixes. Also they like to reset major aspects of the game so they can charge you for features that you already had. And if you contact customer service they will tell you whatever is broken is supposed to be like that. Don't waste your money"

And watching a bunch of ads to try and get gems no thanks.",
            "The app is good for casual play, I usually have a couple of books going at the one time to build up diamonds. The only criticism is things cost too much diamonds and sometimes the videos for free keys and diamonds don't work.",
            "For how expensive this game is, you would think that they would update their stories. It has been two months since some of the stories received a new chapter. Choices are normally 20+ gems EACH and you're not even given that many through the free options they keep mentioning. It will take days to reach that amount using the free gem options. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor and saving yourself a load of disappointment, frustration and regret.",
            "Fun game, but it's completely ridiculous just how expensive it is. You need a TON of diamonds to play, and there is no way of collecting nearly enough for free. You need to buy and even with that, they go so quickly it's not worth it. It's not a choice game when there are 2 options and the one you want costs you at least 20 diamonds, almost every single time. Clothing changes also cost 20 to 25 diamonds. I would be willing to pay a reasonable monthly unlimited amount to play, but this is insane.",

            "There is a bug where I would watch an ad to get a free spin, but it would load forever after watching, and I wouldn't get another spin. Hopefully this gets fixed, but the game is really fun otherwise, but thats a pretty big bug.",
            "Very well designed App. Good food for brain. But lots lots of Ads. Once ¬Ω of levels are completed more Ads (we can skip after 5 secs) will be pushed in between the levels. After completing ¬æ levels, App hangs after playing AD (these are 30secs Ads). For designing, complexity this App deserves 5 stars, but for Ads that are being pushed 2 stars is more than enough. Ads are killing the interest.",
            "Good game I have fun playing during downtime when I go to school but way to many ads after 1 round theres a ad and when you skip it, it gets stuck loading and I have to close the game over and over again.",
            "Best mind relaxing game ever. Whenever I fell bored I always one option to play which is this one. The creator has made it upon the mind of an artiststic person because every artist wants some interesting thing to do as this game.",
            "Very fun game and the ads aren't terrible. But it keeps freezing (loading forever) after almost every ad watched, requiring me to close and report the game. So, when I try to earn extra spins by watching an ad, I get screwed every time."

            "I loved the app until it started draining my battery. And when I did a maintenance to make it stop draining the battery, the app stopped working altogether. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling in order to make the app work. Then it starts draining my battery again. That sucks! First edition that I installed prior to this new one did not do that.",
            "Ive been using this app for years. This app used to open the screen automatically with the \"STOP\" button at the bottom when the alarm went off. Now the alarm goes off and nothing comes up on the screen anymore, I have to open the app and wade through the ads before I can open the alarm itself and turn it off. About 30 to 45 seconds of the alarm bells ringing before silence. Not feeling this at 0500 anymore. Please fix this issue. Im about to switch apps.",
            "A good app, I am considering buying the full version when I have a decent phone. The only thing I would add/change is the 'Fade in' time; it would be ideal to have an option to adjust the 'fade in' time. Personally, I prefer to have the alarm 'fade in' period set at 5 minutes: the current 'fade in' setting does not give me enough time to switch off the alarm calm and collected, instead I fumble and create a noise waking everyone up. Having said that, it is still a good app.",
            "It works really great as an alarm clock and it's the only one that can wake me up but it's super glitchy. Like sometimes alarms won't go off and sometimes alarms will go off at random times. Sometimes alarms will go off at the wrong time so my experience it works well as an alarm clock and it can wake you up amazingly but is super glitchy.",
            "Pretty intuitive. Only cons - lots of ads & notifications drop bar says wrong day (for the alarm) sometimes. Ex: I set an alarm last night, for the following morning; woke up prior to the alarm going off and in the pull down, the alarm says: \"next alarm set for tomorrow at 7:45.\" (When in actuality, it is only hours away, not over 24 hours away..)"

The game is overrun with cheaters who stand outside the maps and kill everyone. Turrets still fire through walls. Every other game is filled with players who stand still but you can't shoot them but they shoot you. This game is unplayable and the european staff responsible should be fired. Scum, just scum.",

            "Game is quite good but so many ads! I got to level 17 and uninstalled, only because after every two levels you are being forced to watch an ad. Considering that the first levels are very easy and only take 2-3 seconds to solve each of them, basically after 10-15 seconds of playing you have to watch 30-35 seconds ads, and you can't skip or go back to the home menu, unless you quit the game. I understand that it is a free game and you rely on ads for your income, but man! Let us play a little bit!",
            "I'm getting use to it and I really do love the game that I will keep playing it. You better fix the bug in this game I get to playing then it comes up with a white circle that goes around and I half to turn my Phone off to star it again so please fix it. Thankyou",
            "An absolute fun puzzle game!This game is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played,plus I don't have to worry about ads because i could just turn off my wifi on my tablet!Absolutely love it!",
            "I got hooked as soon as I started playing! I love the style, the puzzles are progressively more challenging but in a gradual way. I wish the developers spent more time optimizing the game for modern screens, the hole-punch cutout on my screen makes the game render with a large black bar instead of a simple fill around the hole. Also, since I've paid for an ad-free experience, I would expect the notification in the corner to watch an ad go away, but they're still there",
            "more ad than game. continual ads. ads on the screen when you play, ads between each puzzle, ads, ads, ads. neat concept, but experience is ruining by continual ads EVERYWHERE."

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

            "I really liked this game! At one point I was upset from the losing messages, but then they started to be funny! This isn't a game I would play all day but when I only have a couple of minutes it's fun to blow up a pinata!",
            "Fun and interesting game design which can easily be addictive. The downside is the constant ads. For example when you finish a level you get an ad and after that you get asked to watch an ad for additional rewards.",
            "I like it its a fun wacky game but just add more weapons and make everything more in reach and add like different modes other than that its a great game!",
            "So far so so, game is slow at responding at doesn't add points properly game lacks the variety I would expect from this kind of game. Will play a while and repost. At a later time...tony",
            "This game is very funny üòÇ and relaxing but I don't like how you need to restart everything to get diamonds 4/5"

Lately, when trying to locate another phone on our plan, it can only tell me the county that the phone is in - which is absolutely useless information. Other times, it can't locate the phone at all. AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

Horny sounding and looking animated girls narrate the game progress. Whatever floats one's boat...",

After deducting the above amount, it simply says it cannot be done due to some kind of boundries.

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",

The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

I understand that app developers want money, but not everyone can afford to put money out on a game. That being said, I do enjoy playing the app and reading the stories.",
            "Honestly this game is really fun and addicting. The biggest downside would be just how expensive everything is. It's weird that you have to use gems for outfits the he apparently bought for you. You have to use diomands to flirt, have sex, go on a date; pretty much anything to make the storyline interesting will cost you diamonds, a lot of diomands!",
            "The game is fascinating I like it so much. But there is one problem that's making me to hate it.The app keeps on clashing when I open it. I've updated the app today & I've not played since morning bcoz of the problem I've spoken of . So plz help me fix it up so that I can at least play it tomorrow or the day after plz! Plz! Fix it up I don't want to end up deleting the app",
            "I would like to complain that I cant get to read Painted Soldiers (a romantic story). I have used the key to unlock but it take time to download the content. Since I'm using my house WiFi and it's speed but from today it has problems. If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",
            "I understand the world is just slowly starting to develop an open mind. But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "Directional pad isn't very good. Try to move straight forward and can only go slightly left or right of straight, so I just move forward in a bit of a zig zag motion. Got to the first big enemy and hit it once. After that, I could not move (directional pad disappeared completely), nor could I attack. I just stood there while the ogre attacked me repeatedly. Reloaded 5 times with the same result. Too bad, it looks like a pretty good game.",
            "Linear, not open. Colorful, but no real decision making. Couldn't even start the tutorial without encountering begging ads. Pretty lousy intro to a game, but typical of low quality, greedy game makers. Especially ones from China or non US game makers. This game is Korean, so all glitz, nothing original or deep. As we all expect I recieved the standard, insincere, automated reply from the game developer. It always the lie that shows the greed which dominates the gaming business.",
            "Went here to tell something. I did enjoy this game BUT I have this very annoying scenario when i get to duel or team pvp with players who are high ranked per se and it really sucks because it tends me, my character to lag or freeze or *my connection's poor or whatever even though I got a good internet service. Can we do something about that? I don't have other problems encountered with the game other than that.",
            "Gameplay is excellent and customisation options are great. Only one thing mars the whole experience, and that is the constant begging to spend money, the same offer came up 8 times in the space of three minutes. Surely the programming can be changed so it realises that once you have rejected an offer, you don't want it. IF I decide to keep playing I may decide to take up on some offers, but until then I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 3 star review.",
            "This game is good, but there are major problems. 1) Most PVP is pay to win I say most because if you manage properly you don't have to buy anything. But it really comes down to who is willing to buy more. They do try and counter this by giving beginners chances to get S rank gear. But fighting in campaign with S rank gear becomes a chore when clearing stages instead of fun and challenging. 2) Their team matching system is pretty wack. High lvs get put with low lvs which causes imbalance."

            "This is one of the best games Gameloft has created and entertained the world. MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos üéÆüì±then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!üôÇüôè REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüëçüëçüí´üëå‚ú®",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I absolutely LOVE this game. The only criticism is that some pieces dont fit into the puzzles and when it's part of a timed event, it can get a little frustrating. Otherwise, the puzzles are really fun and the graphics are pretty good. I really like the events, and find myself playing this game every day. If you like Puzz-3D you'll LOVE this game. I enjoy learning about all of the different places created, and that new places are a available every week. I hope it is supported for a long time.",
            "I wish there were more room to describe in painful detail how much this game relies on ads. I like ad-based games. Do NOT get me wrong. But when you need to play a 30sec ad to start AND finish a level and to move from screen to screen and to play in the timed events, it takes away from the greatness of the game. My major prob is with being given a choice: ad at the end of a lvl to get more coins or no ad for fewer coins. Easy, right? Except you get an ad either way. This app is dreadful.",
            "The puzzles are fun but the ads are pretty insufferable in the free version. Even when clicking on a puzzle without the ad sign next to it you will have to watch an ad. When closing a puzzle you will have to watch an ad. I'd give it 5 stars if only there were fewer or less irritating ads.",
            "I love this. I don't even care about the adds. I LOVE THIS !!!!! I just wish that I could update more often. Thats how much I play. It says \" bug fixed \". Sometimes it will say that it updated when it didn't. I do play it ALOT, PLEASE FIX THE UPDATE BUTTON. I am addictive to these puzzles. I also learn alot about the places that i did not know. Keep giving me more. CAN I GET AN UPDATE PLEASE DAMN.",
            "I love this game it is amazing how it challenges your brain to fix the puzzle. There is one problem though. The events are hard to do as the cost in game money. And to usually get that is to do puzzles or to get the amount to do the event is real life money. That is all that needs fixed don't make events to expensive. All in all great game."

I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "This game is awful. So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this pleaseüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse üòë we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please üôè fix your game üòî"

            "I couldn't get past the menu. I tried restarting the app a few times and it still wouldn't work. When the logbook menu loaded, the screen started flickering like crazy. If I was epileptic I probably would've had a seizure. The game keeps crashing, even on my other device. It's been nearly 2 hrs and I still cant play. But game looks good, so I'll rate it 3 stars at least.",
            "This game is a great resource/idle type game. The ads aren't intrusive, the art design and sound are great. This is a perfect pick up and play type of game, with the random events and nicely tuned progression more than making up for the relative lack gameplay. The in-app purchases are fairly done as well, never feeling like you're being forced into them, but also being a great way to boost impatient players. Definitely give this game a try!",
            "This is a fun little time burner and the aesthethic is charming. Gameplay is cathartic when things are made. The character are unique and give a retro feel. However this game is a bit lacking in depth, logic, and personality. For starters the equipment system is a bit rubbish, when a character get's something new, the old piece is lost to the void. It's a bit counterintuitive when survivor's can't be wasteful. It would make more sense if the old tool broke and the option to make a new one.",

            "I used to enjoy the game. But, as you progress the levels, the fish are of no use. It seems like they deliberately go to the wrong places when you are in the final moves of any hard level. This leads to the loss of streak as well. Why are the fishies acting all weird?!!",
            "At first is a interesting game, but once you've got to hard level, became really bad and boring for that reason your lucky that i give you 1 star. ..but I won't spend my money buying, life's, this game really this game really sucks cause freeze every time once you reach higher level. ..fix the problem if you're charging all those gifts..what about golden reward? I I hate it when I get to higher level past 100 it freezes and I have to uninstal the game..",
            "Its like when you are playing the game, it wants you to use their moves, which may be way up at the top of the board., and its ludicrous to use their moves, that they are trying to make u use. Thats using up your tries. Makes no sense to use their moves suggestions. And if you don't use their suggestion, they make it difficult to try your own moves, it will get stuck until u use their moves. Almost said their dumb suggestions, because they want you to fail. I earned 13 gold bars, r gone. ."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT üëçüëçüëçüëç",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 üíé and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ‚ô°"

            "Its really nice because it challenges you to build it better and better. The only 2 problems i have encountered with this game is that it goes from easy to super hard too fast! There should be more intermediate levels and slowly introducing inclines, jumps, obstacles and free standing bridges. The camera angle, OMG! This is such a headache. If you want to see where the stress is at, you have yo change it to 2D which is almost 8bit MarioBros 1 style! Its ridiculous! Still great tho!",
            "too many ads,a game that is literally pay to win,ripoff of polybridge,honestly this game is just the poopy mobile version for polybridge,and stolen textures,those who left five stars either 1:never heard of polybridge2:think this games better because it is free and not all people can install polybridge,and i heard one person talking about how polybridge is a ripoff of this and they said \"polybridge was made:2018 and this game was made: 2017 so dont believe that dont Confuse this for polybridge",
            "The developer of this game does not respect your time. This might be the first time in like 10 years Ive written a review complaining about ads but this is ridiculous. Random 30 second ads when you lose, when you win, when you start a level, and literally being forced to watch ads to get enough \"coins\" to unlock a level.. & its legit 2 and a half minutes of ads to unlock the level. Its pure greed, its outrageous and ruins the game. It's fun tho if you dont mind watching ads more than playing it",
            "I think I downloaded the Screen Saver version, because apparently, when I open the app, it NEVER gets to the main menu, or not even a loading screen. It just shows 2 islands, a \"Build a Bridge\" logo on the bottom left corner with some clouds passing by in the sky. I kept my phone on, charging, for the next few hours to see what would happen, and nothing. Still a screen saver. Tried uninstalling, formatting, restarting, but nothing.",
            "I really like this game but since I'm young I don't have money and can't get the extra worlds and I beat this game fast. I ran out of levels to play because of the expense of the extra levels so can you possibly replace the payment with ads or make us beat each world to move on to the next one? Thanks in advance!"

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

There should also be an option to communicate with our teammates in team matches. The time for loading takes more than that of most of the matches. There should be an equality in the teams in multiplayer, it takes off the fun - getting shot as soon as respawned, always.",

I ask that you consider updating the game, add more modes and events. Add more skins and guns and cores. Maybe more missions. I know for a fact that thousands (if not millions) of people enjoy this game as much as I do. Please do not shut down the game. #SaveNovaLegacy",
            "Great game. Now this is for upper end/newer devices and the loading times can be awful, but it is worth it, great gameplay that is hard but fair. This is not a ripoff of halo as I originally feared, with MUCH different gameplay, and none of the ads are forced apon you, they are a decision. Edit: dont give this game a 1 star review because it \"doesn't work on my phone\" because like I said it is for HIGH END DEVICES, which are either brand new or very strong.",
            "This is a really wonderful action packed rpg game with rich gameplay. Well......it would be great if you do something about the vast number of hackers in this game. Yes, there are even youtube videos on how to hack n.o.v.a. legacy. This is a huge problem for normal players like us who want to play the game legally and fair. Please fix this problem üôè.",
            "My tablet is a really old one so the game file is a little bit too heavy, sometimes it'll close itself while I'm in the middle of a gaming session... a few glitches here and there every now and then like doors staying locked even when i've already killed all the spawns or unlocked the doors. But... yea love this game still."

            "Literally, BLOWN AWAY!!! I have never experienced a game like this. Deer Hunter is so basic about hunting in such a beautifully detailed environment. And the Events are just amazing! Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",
            "It's an awesome game. It's like real hunting just on the go!!! Its a really fun game, nothing to complain. ITS AWESOME!!! Its still awesome in 2020!!! 5 star city!!! Huntsman101 level 7 region 2 in about 15 min"

Everytime I upgrade drastically, magically when I join another arena match, everyone else doubles and triples my might. I literally took all my gear off and my might was 35k and everyone in that room were 100 to 300k, I waited for rounds to end and equipped my gear which had me at 326K and then everyone was 550k to 725k. Complete bs. Yep, definitely a money grab game.",

If money is no object you will enjoy. Support services are the worst. Robots with no helpful info...just scripted responses. . I lowered my review for the lame scripted response you added to my comment. It doesnt work.",
            "1. The game glitches way too much 2. The game crashes every 20 - 30 minutes while playing it 3. Its a pay to win game 4. Its so slow loading and loading 5. The game sucks U should have a 2builders from the start and the limit of 5builders, And have a competetive fight only your level can fight you, because i play it then i challenge some raids, after it resets there is a 1.5m powered guy And I only have 200k power, how am i supossed to beat that?!",
            "Mobile Crusader kings meets building combat games like SoS. The gameplay is a mix of those two, really grindy and very much aimed toward wallet warriors. Can still progress f2p but really slowly. My game experience is hindered by long loading times and lag, didn't matter if I used my phone or gaming rig with bluestacks was still slow. Takes forever to load in and any pvp. Frequently, my commands aren't even done due to lag."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",

It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",

App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!ü¶â‚ô•Ô∏èüåû‚òÑ‚ö°üíöüíôüíúüí• P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over ¬£10 for an entire year!)"

            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",
            "Still kinda on the fence with this app since switching over from a very corrupt AT&T. I can say that because I've been with them for over 20 years. They went bad about 4 years ago. Thank you Verizon.",

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",
            "Slows down tablets and crashes constantly. So much lagg and crashes it starting to get old fast. About to uninstall this game after 3 days of trying to play."

Thinking it was an issue with my phone I uninstalled and reinstalled apps, lost all my boosters, silver coins etc the only thing that saved was the level I was at. Instead of being a relaxing game it's now really frustrating to play.",
            "It's a fun game but you have to admit you cheat. How do I get all but 1 pet off the board and you don't drop pets or the color blocks. If my booster is able to be used you cannot bc it kicks you out of the game. Why do you have us fill the piggy bank and then want us to pay for get the gold bars? They should be free. Why is there no way to win tickets to the circus? This game needs to be tweaked a lil bit and the cheating should stop. Just my opinion though.",

I have played it on several devices since 2013.. at first the game was fun & enjoyable...how ever over the past 18 months..it has Had sooooo! Many flaws...cheats...unresponsive ! constantly lags. If you notify the team.. u simply get A very automated! Sorry & ur told to sign in & out of Facebook. .this will solve the issues... well it dose NOT! Solve the constant issues & nor dose it help. üò°",

            "This app is great. Lots of options. However, it irritates the friggin piss outta me that even though the app has been around for years and they're mostly known for their TV shows, they still don't have a Skip Intro option! If I'm binge watching a show, I don't wanna have to watch the intro every single freakin time! Disney+ has it and they haven't even been out for a year yet! Like why hasn't that been added yet!?",
            "Commercials commercialscommercials Maybe it is deliberate to drive you to buy the ad-free option. It just makes me despise Hulu. It makes even Netflix seem like a good app. If you want to rewind, it triggers commercials. Fast-forward? Commercials. Not infrequently, you get to see the same set of commercials. Sometimes, you get to watch them three times in a row. Over and over and over. Yay. (It's maddening.) And avoidable. And inept programming.",
            "I've never had an issue with this program in all the years I've used it, however, NOW I DO and I need to uninstall and reinstall, but there is NO way that I found to do that, yet.... What a serious pain and it shouldn't be. This is my home computer, and this shouldn't be a national secret how to do this! I'm soooo damn annoyed. The program loads just fine, but soon as I click a play arrow it freezes everything. I looked at the tools/inspect page, it clear shows the play path has been altered somehow. I don't do computer coding or maybe I could fix this myself, but it should be a simple fix to uninstall and reinstall like you would on your phone. I'm 65 years old, I am running Windows 7 because I like it. This really shouldn't be happening.",
            "Very convenient for listening to my news programs on ABC while out of town or otherwise away from home. But \"watching\" my shows on the Hulu app mean I can't multi-task on my phone. It would be nice to adjust settings so it continued to play while my phone is locked or if I go to another app. Like I do with audiobooks. And when I put my unlocked phone in my pocket with the app running, it always seems to bounce to another show on my \"next up\" list before the show I am interested ends.",
            "I love Hulu I will always have it on my phone! I usually never have a problem and if i do, the app some how fixes its self. If i disconnect i just reload and its fixed. I have never had a issue that prevented me from watching my favorite adult cartoons. The price is good the content is awesome! I can always find something to watch for what ever situation. Hulu is doing everything right in my book!"

Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",

It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ‚úîmark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great ‚Äî the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash ‚Äî even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

And the reason why i didnt give it 5 stars its becouse of their delivery amount, its too expensive .",
            "Very easy to use and so far the clothing quality has been pretty good. I have 4 stars because I think more work should be done on the website interface to make it adapt to pc better. It's very difficult using Shein on my laptop. Additionally, I would love if the Taiwan site can add an option to change the language (although billing and clothing descriptions and searches are in english), the headings are in chinese. The sizing is sometimes wayy off. Always use reviews to try to gauge your size.",

If you love shopping for things that are inexpensive bit still great quality, this is the app for you.",

When I look up dresses it gives me an option for modest dresses, what a great feature! I'm a mom and proud of it, so there is no need to flaunt too much chest or super high cut dresses, thanks Shein! Everything I've ordered through this app has been great quality and even better prices! Highly recommend!",
            "Pretty good! So genuinely this app is really good. Definitely WAY better then Forever 21. There are so many good deals and cute clothing! The clothing looks like the pictures on the app! I've seen only good reviews. I haven't ordered anything yet, but definitely get this app!! ‚ù§‚ù§"

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.üëà",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Honestly, I feel like this is the peak of infinite runners. The ads are inexistent, unless you deliberately watch them for rewards. The gameplay is great, and there's tons of events being held all the time + one marzillion collectibles. Does it have flaws? Of course. Sometimes the game is almost unfair in patterns, and unforgiving as well. Past 4000m is impossible, sans vehicles. All in all, one of the best games on the Google Play Store. Heck, on any app store.",
            "Okay normally I don't do this but I feel it's necessary here. I first played the game when it first came out. Since then I've reinstalled it every few years. Sadly there always seems to be a new problem whenever I do. I have had both my Jetpack and gadgets lock onto the current setting most recently it simply failed to save my progress. That said the game is still fun and you can play as much as you want and the\"game\" part works just fine. Just be wary if you try to customize at all",
            "I love this game. Iv loved this game for years. It's been a while since iv consistently played it but I started it up again today. Iv had several good games but the last time I opened it, it was almost like I started over. Most of my coins are gone (I had almost 30,000), the last jetpack I bought is no longer purchased and when I pause the game, I can no longer quit or leave the game. I can only resume. Plus the latest upgrade I purchased is also no longer purchased.",
            "This is probably the most original mobile game ever. Yes, it COULD be called an endless runner, but this game is it's own style of endless runner. The items, all the way down to how the \"endless runner\" graphics look. If I could I would rate it a 10 out of 5 stars. Love your games! Keep it up!",
            "I love this game.Also it has got an update the update is very nice. Everyone should install this game. But today when I played this game it was full glitches. I thought to reset my mobile but when I clicked the app it took hours to load the game. The game did not stop loading and I got mad and uninstall the game. Sorry."

The music is relaxing as well. Keep doing what you're doing Noodlecake studios!! 5/5",
            "Another beautiful adventure with Alto & friends, don't miss out on this amazing fun game, challenging slip & glide fast ride down slops scoring high points along the way by pulling off a few flips & tricks!! Love the beautiful scenes backdropped behind with a wonderful soundtrack, super chill, wicked game, I love Alto characters, this game rocks!!",
            "Really fun, it's the same, just running but the challenges can be difficult so it's not bad at all. I always play it on the bus to school because I don't have mobile data so I can only use non Internet stuff. This is really good and you should install it.",
            "Developers, I really love your game but i have some ideas that may do this game better. I think it's a good idea to add all the features of Zen mode in a main mode because the combo score and another numerals distract you sometime and this beautiful musical composition from Zen mode deserves to be heard in a simple mode. And the second idea is to add kilometres score in Zen",
            "The ads ruin it! Clicking X still opens the ads!!! FIX IT! The game itself is nice and fun, ads finance it, makes sense. But these ads are too often (debatable) and when they are done, clicking the X to get back to the game opens them in the browser. This is borderline harassment! A second click after. going back to the game app, clicking the X closes it. So it is intended by the developers to get more money as your click is now also triggering their website. FIX IT, this is cheap!"

            "Very confusing. Every time I try to login I have to change my password. Takes me forever to accomplish anything with ATT. I uninstalled this app, could not get it to let me in. Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!üò†üò†üò°üò§ OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

            "Good graphics (mouth movements need some help.), good storyline, some inconsistencies, but, not too bad. EXPENSIVE! Unless you have A LOT of patience and timing. The 8 hour conversations, that take 30+ energy to complete 1/5 of it. Ridiculous. And , forbid, you can't make it back in time to finish it..... all that time and energy wasted. I spent some money in the game and regret it. It really isn't worth it. Do the math.",
            "I love this game! The storyline, characters mini games and more. However I do have a minor issue with the energy. It runs out really quickly and takes quite a long time to recharge again. Another small thing with the energy is sometimes if I'm over the energy limit, the excess energy I collect does not count and sometimes I lose a bit of energy because of this. However amazing game! Definitely worth downloading :)",
            "Frustrating at times, when it comes to events. You either have to be willing to put in real money or accept the fact you aren't going to win. Dueling spell chances are overpowering against you, only getting 1 stun in three matches (which is often)! While the opponent can get it one every 2-3 spells to maximum effect. The story is good and thrilling, good character relationships and lore. I've been playing since day one but you can see where the money grab is, which I have fallen into?",
            "New review: I've been playing this a lot since lockdown, and am contantly impressed with the creativity and new stuff the devs come up with, for what is essentially a free game. Yes, they do push real money transactions, but if you don't mind spending more time on it, you get everything anyway. This game has an interesting story, lots of side quests, animals to interact with and loads of options to customise your character and dorm. And all of it in Hogwarts! :)",
            "The game can be fun sometimes so I put 2 stars. However, its really just a scheme to make as much money from the players as possible. While the idea is a free to play concept, the amount of time it takes to recharge energy is actually ridiculous. They are constantly releasing time sensitive events that give the players less than 5 days to complete which on the surface is fine and kind of fun. But it is literally impossible to complete all of the tasks with the limited energy = pay to win game."

            "its okay, but you need so many gems to get the stuff and like you got to wait THREE HOURS, to get only TWO ticket things to play again. Also when you finish a thing it only gives you ONE gem. Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",
            "I like how many stories there are and that you can choose where the path takes you but I do not like that all the more well thought out stories have so many choices that are gems. Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

(Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over ¬£40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

I did one piercing and I am uninstalling!! If I could rate this game lower than one star, TRUST ME!! This would have a negative 1000 star rating! Never again!",
            "This game is an absolute joke. To many ads, and even if you pass on the upgrades it will still play at least one ad after every level some times more. You spend more time watching ads then you do playing the game. I've only done 3 piercings and I will be deleting this game. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",
            "This was a huge disappointment the game itself is a great design but after doing 2 people the game wigs out and makes it where you cant see anything so you have to close the app and reopen it , and not to mention when you're in the middle of doing something and then an add pops up not before or after no in the middle. Needs alot of work",
            "Everything is very far off from where your finger actually is on the screen. You have to watch ads to do literally anything in the game, and, on top of those ads you have to watch to progress, you also get random ones too. I get that they need ads to make money, but this is ridiculous. Why have games come to this?",
            "Yeah everybody's right about this game is way too many ads nobody should get this game cuz there's so much else you can't even play the game I got past the first episode then there's that and then I couldn't afford that because the video was so long and then I had to watch another ad before I picked it a different ear piercing and another add another another"

        "comments": [
            "The newer versions have a lot of glitches and is extremely slow. For example, sometimes I add items to my cart and then they all disappear. Sometimes the app will suddenly have every item listed as out of stock and you have to restart. When you add items and hit + to increase the number of items it takes forever. Hopefully they fix these issues.",
            "This new update is buggy and I can't check out. It took me an hour to fill my cart due to all the bugs and when I finally clicked check out of course that failed too and I lost the last pick-up slot of the day and have to go grocery shopping in the snow now... I have a Samsung Galaxy. The bugs were: search wouldn't work, browse by category wouldn't work, the app kept crashing and removing most of the items in my cart, and when I clicked check out it said \"failed to fetch payment.\"",
            "This app gets slower everytime I use it. It's more like a glitch generator, and an anger creator. But, compared to going inside of that level of hell, there's really no difference, other than not dealing with the public clowns and Karen's. I continue to use this app though. Am I a glutton for punishment, or a slave of this corporate world that is left no other options?......yes.",
            "This ap is FRUSTRATING and is getting worse! The screen constantly freezes, it won't allow you to side swipe when you are supposed to be able to and right in the middle of looking at something the screen will go blank to \"update\" the page and sometimes it will come back up to the page you were on and sometimes take you all the way to the very beginning of opening the ap. And it's not my internet because it's very reliable and the ap does this no matter what service I'm using.",
            "I thought it was me!! I literally bought a new phone to see if it would fix the issues. When uninstalling and reinstalling the app I just happened to take a look at the reviews, lo and behold every single person in the world has the same problem I do since they combined the websites,hece it completely sucks. I like everyone on here I'm going to have to use a different online shopping app for a different store because this app is useless."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "I like the new layout and look. However, I would give 5 stars if I didn't have to search for what comes through on the alert notifications. Example, \"there's a special loan offer\", where?! I have search for it, when the app should go right to the information that is on alert notification, and not just the home page. Many alerts I just ignore, because I become frustrated trying to find them. Just open directly to them once pressed, otherwise I'm just wasting time seeing the same information.",
            "I really love this app and the website. It's convenient and easy to use. My only complaint right now it that no matter how many times I click on \"Recommendations\" and scroll through it, it ALWAYS says there is 1 waiting. It's been going on for a while and it's on both desktop and mobile, so I know it's not just this latest update to the app. I don't like the advertising of the credit cards all the time but I get it, to keep the app free you need to have ads, no problem. Recommend me stuff all the time, I don't care, just register that I've seen it once I have.",
            "Great app, I mean ausome app, in less than a year, this app has helped me get all three of my credit scores boosted. They were all between 510-530 and now, only a year later all three range from 622-643. So this app has done wonders. After a year of doing what the app said I went from having no credit to having 3 credit cards and owning a house. SO CREDIT KARMA GETS A 10 STAR RATING FROM ME. I USED TO SPEND MONEY AS FAST AS IT HIT MY POCKET NOW I HAVE OVER 10,000 IN SAVINGS AND I'M A PACK RAT.",
            "Good app, but this latest update sucks. I don't like the new UI, and it feels slower now. And one thing that's been bugging me forever, when you open the app and it displays where you enter your pin, raise all the numbers up. It's way too low. But the in app UI sucks now. Change it back please. It was easier on the eyes before and easier to read",
            "I've been monitoring my credit for a couple years now with Credit Karma, but this is thee worst update they've done! Not to mention, your score in the app will never be what a lender pulls. So I just use it to monitor credit card usage and any collections. Other than that, the app is garbage. Edit to include CK's response: I already know that. I am informing others, because clearly your formula isn't accurate. And if it's not accurate... it's not useful."

            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant üòÅüòâ",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

The adverts & rewards were many & selectable & I watched them but now, every couple of minutes a 5 second ad shows, then a popup ad, then another.... just spoils the game. I constantly viewed the ads to get the rewards but now it's just plain infuriatingly irritating. Still a great game but latest update bombards you with so many ads it completely spoils the gameplay and flow of the game. Sorry, I'm out.",
            "The best of its kind! Thank you for the support and fast response to your community. In the new arena mode how you can earn more points? What's the concept? First time got 22k high score and after that I can reach only 15k",
            "I actually like the game. It's a good shooter. My problem was that I bought gems didn't receive them. Contacted the developer twice and did get an acknowledgement let alone a response.. in the end had to seek a refund from Google. Thanks Google üëç but shame on the developer üëé",
            "Retro vertical space shmup. If you're a fan, you might like this one. I'd recommend it as the ads haven't been oppressive and it's pretty straightforward.",
            "Love the game. It is way better and much less glitchier sluggish like some other one which I wouldnt recommend. One setting that they also remembered with these type of games with lots of flying and enemies and exploding etc, is the the one to give you a choice if you want to play with High, medium or low graphic settings. That gives you a 1 in 3 chance to play the game and not like others force you too and then its sluggish and glitchy. Well done devs. Great game."

            "Used to love this game. Hadn't played in a little while and wanted to play again. Saying the ads are excessive is being kind. The free version didn't used to be like this. It's not even playable anymore and the only way to remove the obnoxious amount of ads is to get the subscription at $2.99/wk. Sadly 'Uninstall' is the best option.",
            "This used to be one of my favorite games. Now they have added a completely excessive amount of ads. After every guess, right or wrong, I get an add. THIS WHOLE GAME HAS JUST BECOME NON-STOP ADDS. I spend more time now watching adds then playing the game. It takes me 3 seconds to make my new guess and type it...but then I get a 45 second long addü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",
            "I have been playing this a lot lately, it's good fun and addictive. Some of the levels repeat (I just got exact same picture I've had before) but good variety overall. However the addition of ads popping up after guesses is really annoying. I could put up with it for hints or at the end of a level but it's really off-putting now. My other negative would be once you advance in the game you have to scroll all the way down every time. It would be nice to have a way to jump down to where you're at.",
            "An ad after every guess?! What the hell people? I've played this game for quiet a while and have always enjoyed it. Now I'm uninstalling it because that is obnoxious that you feel the need to flood people with ads after every guess. Right or wrong. Doesn't matter. Here's an ad. Oh whats that? Another one? You sure? Its only been one word, but okay. BAM!!!! ANOTHER AD!!!!",
            "Haven't played in a long time and decided to reinstall it. Mad at my self for doing it. There is an ad after each guess making it enjoyable like it use to be. Had to uninstall. Understand having ads but that was way to much."

I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",

It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",

The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery.

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not üòä); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a ¬£iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",

I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

            "This game is really good for using time when you have nothing to do and is generally a very fun game. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because, I was saving up 15 dollars (in game) to buy the coin rain and once I got the 15 needed it stopped me from buying it.",
            "This is a pretty good idle game. You can play it entirely without an internet connection and it doesn't shove microtransactions in your face every 5 seconds. I definitely recommend this game if you like idle games.",
            "I don't have all the badges in the game but it is pretty good not going to lie I got all the factories and I got to the millions of the Mondays and I got a couple robots I got like 18 and right now I got the trophy my first Trophy and recent at the game I'll see you later guys now time for me to work doing this"

            "This app deserves 6 STARS!!!! I love the fact that it gives you the option to list apps from most recent to oldest. I usually share apps using wifi direct between my samsung phones, and this app has never let me down. Does not affect battery life on none of my phone, which was my primary concern. An app that doesn't consume (much) battery isn't certainly doing any background activity. It's a free app, and a good one too; therefore the least I can do is to write this sort of lengthy review, lol.",
            "This is a very good app. There is a SELECT ALL but it's not obvious, long press any single apk, then tap select all context menu. It's also a little odd that there is no save option only share but that's not too much of a problem since you can share to your a file explorer with the added advantage that you can save to any location that you choose at the time rather than a default folder. Overall a very good app.",
            "I'm always skeptical about these kind of apps because they keep promising things and don't deliver. I tried other apps and no luck but this app worked instantly, I'm actually amazed. I transferred an app to my tablet from my phone via WiFi direct and it worked. Now I'm using the app on my tablet. Thank you app developers for making a genuinely easy app to use and that works what it was intended for. I had to write this to let others know. Thank you once again.",
            "I hate it.when i use this app and the transfer finished the other device need to install it say \"app not installed\" and i try it again \"app not installed \"plss fix it.",

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to üëç. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "This game deserves a million stars out of five. The chance to visit another village is like visiting another planet. Mindblowing those villages are. That the game goes from night to day synchronized to the actual diurnal nocturnal quotidian circadian algorithm of natural time actually brought me to tears, in a good way. The spirit of the medieval forest is present in this smurfy app. Smurfeat emptor: October 30 2020. Paid $6.81 for lunar new year dragon and did not get it. App snapped off after.",
            "Played this game years ago and missed it, had to come back. Yes, there are glitches. Read up on how to manually save your game. The extra attention is worth it. The game is super cute, I found game support to be helpful when I had an issue. It's the only game I happily spend real money on, much to my husbands chagrin muaha! Love the development, the graphics, being able to create my village. Each day I look forward to opening up my village and working on it makes me smile.",
            "Super cute!! Look forward to playing with my favorite Smurfs everyday. Love the new updates and graphics. One issue I don't like is somethings are worth more money than the smurf huts, like how Fairy Prince Garth is normally worth $24.99. I don't think somethings will be worth the price we're paying. Other than that, the game is so worth playing or at least taking a look at.",
            "I wish i could do 0 stars. I had a huge village, including other locations like the grove etc. But It doesn't save anything after i last downloaded it. No new buildings, anything i place in a garden bed, it's just gone whenever i open the app again, even if it only been a few minutes.",
            "Excellent gameplay. You will not get bored if you play online or offline. Everytime more interesting things are coming...but for suggestion i just suggest that improve gameplay for story line and make more story thinkful and adventures."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a üåü from me."

Sometimes I put down a decoration or a statue and it disappears, the one time I went into my game and all my statues were gone! It's mainly just been decorations thats been disappearing now but I work so hard for them and it's gone. Please fix this bug and I will rate this game 5 star again. Over all, this is a very fun game, maybe fix the gauntlet spins to get better prizes, but everything else is great!",
            "Typically a fun and well working game. However, I have struggles when speeding up and watching an ad, after watching it and pressing the x to exit that ad. 6 times out of 10 I will have to exit the app due to the screen greying out and constantly changing to my home screen and the grey screen of the game. When I exit the app and re-enter, I lose the speed up. This does happen occasionally throughout the game but mostly on ads.",
            "The game is, well, decent. It is fun at times; you can train dragons, defend Berk, and unlock powerful additions to your team. The only problem I have with this game is the ads. Oh the ADS. I'm aware you need ads to keep the game running, but it gets so overly excessive. It feels like the Dragon Rider memberships is a pay-to-win system. I feel like if you could remove some things only exclusive to Dragon Riders and make them available to all players, membership or not, I'd say 5 stars.",
            "The game itself is interesting and the goals are challenging enough, the game deserves 4 stars but the customer support is negligible and a total let down. I purchased a bonus pack and did not receive my items, I tried numerous times to contact support via the in game bot and via the developer website to no avail. As a paying member I find this really disappointing. Also the dragon spins tend to just give you useless things and not the collective items.",
            "I love this Game. I've been playing for years ! They keep growing it and improving it and adding to it. My Berk is huge and I have so many dragons. Always new challenges and gauntlets and dragons. They dress it up for the seasons Berkstyle. Plus you can get costumes for your dragons. The babies are adorable. I'll never stop playing. It's good because you can do a little or a lot."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game üëå"

            "This game is really good! You can have nice endings without spending money. It would take you more time yes but in the most otome games I have played they don't give you so much opportunities to get gems (other money worth things). Thank you very much for looking out that it is enjoyable too for the once who can't or don't want to spend money! ^^",
            "The game has improved since I first played it months ago and the experience was much more enjoyable. I'm glad they added an alternative to earning rubies and even though it takes a bit of time and effort, its worth it to see the full story. So even though the story and premise is not my favorite, it's still pretty fun and I appreciate the developers actually listening to the feedback they're getting and improving their game.",
            "I love this game. The story was fantastic and so were the characters. Mo-wan is my favorite. I just wish there was more content. The ending was bittersweet because I liked it so much I didn't want it to end yet. Anyway, thank you so much for making this game! ^^ [EDIT] Omg, you added a puzzle illustration! I was craving new art from this game. And now I can finally look forward to something new when I open a fortune. Once again, thank you for making this game!",
            "Ive played several games from this company & they're all the same. The storlines are great. The problem is that getting relationship up with the characters is pretty hard without spending money, and the standard endings are awful. When im forced into a situation like that, i don't event want to try another ending, i just delete the app.",
            "I liked the plot and the character styles are amazing,overall love this game üôÇ but When I decided to download one of the apps to earn free gems And I reache the goal yet I havent recieved the prize. Maybe if I wait alittle while. But I love the game"

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ‚ù§",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

I dont know why this is happening still I close the game 3 or 4 times then it is fixed. I do this like 3 or 4 times daily. But good work in making this game.",
            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",
            "I'm not gonna lie... I love this game... It's satisfying... But some of the levels REALLY test my patience... Sometimes I think there's absolutely no way to solve certain levels... It really ticks me off... There's also a lot of ads... But i'm not as bothered by that..."

            "This game is great but the sad thing about this is that, whenever I update the app I should uninstall it first to get the updated version because if not, it won't work, all the money that I have saved are all gone. There were also some hairstyles that were removed, the short straight black and the short curled black hair, those were my favs, why'd you remove that. Also whenever I play the style challenge, the things that I already bought before have no mark if it's right for the event or not.",
            "Nice game but you get very limited options to choose from. To get more, either you buy the dresses and stuff which is quite expensive OR wactch ads. The issue is when you watch videos to earn coins the game crashes at the end of the video and you loose rewards. It happened multiple times..looks like I'm being foolish just watching ads and wasting my precious time.",
            "This is a great game it's just the new update is very weird. The update changed most of my clothes out with new ones and it doesn't tell you that this item isn't for the theme, which I dont like. Other then that it's a fabulous game and has given me a better sense of style.",
            "I love this game 100% the graphics are great and the outfits are fireüî•, BUT the problem I got is that if u don't pick what the game gives u to wear u don't get 10 out a 10 and the cost for some things are too high I would love if u could fix that.",
            "I really like the game. The biggest bummer of this app is while your progress is saved. Your wardrobe and money are not saved. So you loose all of it if you change phone or want to play in a different device. I hope it gets fixed."

            "This is my favorite truck driving game, good controls, challenging, lots of fun, the only bad thing is while you're driving the ads that pop up at the top of the screen and stay there while you're driving makes the game lag so bad you can't hardly control or play the game ,So if you could Please fix this problem, I would Definitely give 5 stars",
            "The game is okay. But there are a lot of ads. The controls are hard because they are so small. The triangles for turning are okay but they are tiny so it makes it harder. Half the time i try to hook up to a trailer the truck and trailer collide causing damage on the truck and it wont hook so i have to exit out of the game to reset it so hopefully the next time i watch 5 ads to get in it will hook to a trailer. The game iver all is fun but every time i stop to get fuel, at the scale, or to sleep",
            "When you try to hook up the load most of the time it acts like your hitting something or your truck just goes right threw the load, very frustrating!! And you can't see the red lights even when zoomed in, please fix these problems! Other than that great game, I will give 5 stars, when fixed, thanks.",
            "The gameplay is superb. But needs some improvement in graphics and make it a bit more realistic. The game also needs 6-lane roads and new places in the map. Overall this has the best handling among all the other simulators. Also, everytime I go to Nashville, I'm charged with a speed ticket, no matter how slow or how fast I am. I have been playing this since 2017 and still cant get enough. Although now a little bored with gfx and maps.",
            "Couldn't play the game for more than 15 seconds without an ad. And why would I want to pay for an ad free experience if I haven't had an opportunity to try the game. Also, the game requests access to contacts, and wants permission to make and manage phone calls which seems odd for a game like this."

            "Fun game...longest I have ever kept a game on my phone. LOVE that I don't have to sit through commercials in order to play or anything!! A few years, when I first started playing, I had the ability to win time...I miss that. Made it more fun to win an hour (up to 24 hrs) of free play time. Guess they lost too much $$ on people not buying items to help them pass a level. Oh well.",
            "I love this game. Great way to pass the time. I do have a couple of things. What if for every 100 levels you get one of each boost and 25 coins? Maybe bring back challenge of unlimited lives for a 24 hours? Sometimes it sucks when it takes 3 days to complete one level, it gets frustrating and boring. I have spent many hours playing this game and spent some money and do really enjoy it.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until it got to the higher levels (im on level 3564) I have spent plenty of money on this game because once you only get 5 free lives and when your out it takes 20 minutes to get another life. I understand the levels will get harder but I think its ridiculous to only get a new life every 20 minutes. I don't want to have to delete this app but I can't continue to spend $1.99-$12.99 just to be able to play continuously.",
            "I actually really love this game. there's no ads (!!!!!!) and there's really no need to spend money if u are patient. it's pretty much entirely luck based so as long as u are patient and keep trying u can pass any level. my only complaint is some of the levels seem unnecessarily hard which can get very frustrating but other than that I would highly recommend this game",
            "Play game all the time my only problem is that you have to continuesly have to update after doing 50 levels beyond 4000, and my Facebook friends dissappeared. Hey Doodle Bob I am a real person playing this game and yes I passed level 4000. I can honestly say, I have NOT spent any money on this game and do not plan on it. Just wait for lives to add up and continue to play."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5‚≠ê",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including ‚Ä¢ More materials ‚Ä¢ More space ‚Ä¢ And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ‚ù§ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "Terrible app, please don't ask me to comment again I've made my point!!! Worst app ever!!! I'm not sure if I'm paying for it, but the developer needs to Improve this app before I give it 5 Stars!!! Every time I login, I get message, not available, very frustrating!!!",

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! ü§òüòé",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "Bunch of ads and a terrible energy system, which basically let's you start a one puzzle per day, unless you pay or watch even more ads (if there weren't enough already). One puzzle takes around 10 minutes to complete, so there you have it - play for 19 minutes, wait 24 hrs, play for 10 minutes again, wait another 24 hrs etc. Honestly you can find much better games out there and I hope you do. I'm not saying this particular game is bad, but its monetization is just terrible. ... Please fix.",
            "In my initial review, I talked about the long ads between each group. Since then there is a way to shorten the ad after only 3-5 seconds. So my update is to say that this is a really fun take on a crossword puzzle and the fact that the developers listened and worked out a solution gives the game a solid 5 stars. Thank you for responding and for working to find a solution!",
            "I have a Samsung Note9 but this game uses too much battery and makes my phone hot. I love, love, love this game so these facts make me sad. UPDATE: some of the ads (which I do not mind watching since they let me play for free, I can't afford to pay) but some of the ads are freezing the game. Please fix these issues. I do not want to delete. Have a blessed day",
            "I like this game, but there are too many ads. Each game takes 2 tokens and there aren't enough ways to gain tokens. It would be best to find ways to motivate people to play the game. Do fun games where they can win more tokens. Way too many ads!! Before you can play. After you play. Its crazy and a waste of time. Otherwise I really like this game and would probably keep playing of the ad situation can be made better.",
            "I love this game.Awsome,wonderful,amazing,superbüòäüòäüòòüòòüòö.This might be the best game among all crossword games.There are even powerups to help if we are unable to find the word for a question.Very nice wonderful game.But the only thing is ,it works so slow if my data pack is over.I wish it to be work fast though my data pack is over .Hence i gave 4 stars. Apart from this ,it a awesome game .Loved it.ü§óü§ó"

            "Band has been fantastic! I've been using it for the last 3 years since I became cheer director for our local youth league. It keeps me organized and everything in one spot. Its so helpful with parents. You can add everyone to your band and set things how you want them. They even have a live streaming option, polls, attendance and sooo much more. I will always use band for any group stuff I may have.",
            "I love the original Band App. It works so well from. My team at work and our daughters softball team to communicate with the parents. I recently downloaded the BAND FOR KIDS for my daughter to talk to her teammates, it hasn't worked yet. I have paid 2 different times, $.50 and I still can't make it work.",
            "Great app--has essentially transformed our group's communication. Feature request: Please allow toggling the visibility of calendars within a Band. If we have multiple calendars created for different purposes, it would be nice to be able to declutter the agenda view by hiding events from irrelevant calendars. Also, please let us specify an individual calendar (when there are multiple) from a specific band when we are creating a widget. Thank you, developers!",
            "This is a excellent app. I was able to listen enjoy and be a part of a church service that was active. Thank you Pastor Rodrick Reeve of New Creation family worship center. Also the staff and congregation. Love the way it works. I will tell others how good it is. Thanks.ü§©",
            "Perhaps the best application to manage a sports team activities and keep everyone coordinated and on the same page. Same is true for the recording project, as it is a platform to have all the materials shared and updated between the participants."

            "I really like this app when it works, but it's got some bugs that make biofeedback mode unusable sometimes, and that makes me question it's accuracy all of the time. Sometimes when it detects my heart rate, it seems accurate, but sometimes the HR it reports is WAY OFF. Example: it says my HR is fluctuating between 40 and 55 but it's really closer to 80. Simple mode is great.",
            "This is great. Love the ambient sound options, but I would like it much more if I could choose to listen to the beat of my heart instead of the breathing rate. My breathe makes its own sound and the ball can bounce silently. I'd like a simple peaceful sounding heart beat to meditate with or the possibility of listening to both breathe and heartbeat.",
            "It is a great app and premiss, but I got it with the hope of using the heartrate monitor feature in conjunction with the breathing tool, but the flashlight kept burning my finger and so I couldn't use it for more than 30 seconds at time like I'd wanted. If you guys debug that aspect of it, I would defiantly give it a try again.",
            "The problem is that the biofeedback mode is utterly useless because the heart rate measurements via the camera are so unreliable and noisy. Other apps manage to do it perfectly fine so I can only conclude that the developers are either incompetent or just don't care. Either way, a waste of my money.",

            "Great game. Superb quality and excellent graphics. The only thing is when you run out of balls and you are sent back to the home screen you cannot continue without the premium bonus. There should at least be 1 more free gamemode or it will get boring. If it gets boring you loose players. If you loose players it will run downhill quickly. Please improve this. If it gets improved I will rate 5. For now its 4",
            "I love this game! It's really good,time eating and fun! The graphics is just out of this world! I just don't like 2 things: 1.the fact that you have to restart the game every time from the beginning (if you don't want to buy premium) 2.when you miss only ONE crystal you lose all multiballs!(and the steps). That 2 facts are the reason I gave this game 4 stars. I would recommend this though!",
            "It's really fun and helps me focus, the music in the background and the sounds of breaking glass is also very relaxing, but one thing i noticed is when they tell you \"checkpoint saved\", sometimes it doesnt let you click on the screen or doesn't detect your fingers on the screen, if you could fix that, that would be great!üëåüíñ",
            "It's a really nice game . N I really liked it just the thing is that u have to take a look at ur balls otherwise it does not take time to be finished üòÇ Leaving this the game is perfect. If u r bored u can absolutely play it. It's the best way to time pass. If u r out u will definitely play the other But u will never b full of this game.üòÅ Play and enjoy the game.",
            "I love this game! The only thing i have a problem with is there's not enough levels. I passed every level, then it goes to endless mode i think it's called. Other than that it's an awesome game, very well made. Side note: i did purchase the premium version, because of how much i love this game!"

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

            "Started playing it, thought it would be 3D or as advertised but it isn't, never mind that, game is too much for my device, way too many things happening. Plus the tutorial is so long, I ended up just building and upgrading things I don't know. In fact all the building made me want to play Sim city, if they designed it that way it be enjoyable.",
            "The only reason I am not giving this game 5 stars is that there is no reward for those who don' t spend a lot of money. All events pull you in to spending money - its a choice, I know but can't some events reward perseverance, loyalty and time? It is impossible to be ranked in anything without spending. The difference in players is obscene. In our kingdom (798) it is impossible to survive without being shielded 24/7, which costs. Saying all that, it's bloody fantastic!",
            "Great Game but only way to Play is to PAY !!! If your short on money this game is definitely not for YOU !!! You can play the game without spending but it will take you forever to build. And you will be constantly being farmed by larger opponents healing your troops and losing your resources. Better to Play a one shooter game or download solitary.",
            "There are several issues with this game. First when tapping the bar to increase resource amount then it maxes it out. This caused me to loss all resource I have gotten so to attack because there is no real good way to get shields that I have determined. Alot of stuff to build that really does not help you at low levels. They say it is used as you get higher level but is very inconvenient at times as it feels like you are missing something. When you are killed you very little resource back even",
            "I really liked this game at first until y'all decided to start charging more and more for everything. Honor pass used to be 2 bucks, then 3 now you want 5 for it. You charge people to get the items just to try and play some of your activities but then you don't even give them enough. And the glitches and bugs? I've had millions of resources removed from my account, I've had issue with claiming on prize packs in my messages. It's ridiculous because no new players are added to our kingdoms ever."

            "challenging & interesting game. Certain levels are too challenging for the simple minded like me! Tempted to give up many times as it's too time consuming! üò¢Don't understand why the gold bars are not available for use even though the piggy bank has been full many times. Getting too difficult to complete a level, impossible in fact for hours on end. Very tempted to give up all together & try other games. Getting to a stage where it's too time consuming to complete a level. Losing interest.",
            "This game is fun sometimes, until you have one left and you lose. This game is rigged. Cause they can give you what you need if there is only one left, but they want you to spend money, and when you do spend a little money, you would expect to get cheaper prizes and better prizes. Y'all need to do something about it because im getting annoyed when that happens after I've spent $30 or $40, im expecting better results with my spending",
            "Been Playing for 10 years and I'm obsessed with this game. I love the animals and the challenges, I have gotten all of the animals in the game w/o really putting 5$ in and playing on/off for so many years. So Its a great game with great side games you can play for hours. To the Developers I would like to see more of the level streak boost. For every level you pass you get boosters on your next like the candy crush sagas have. Thank You if you made it here!",
            "Great game until you reach the pay wall level. Move the sheep to the hay.. yeah when the game decides that you're allowed to. No information provided on how to move the sheep, thought I'd got the last sheep to the hay with my last move but NOOOO.. game decides that the same move I'd made with the previous sheep was not allowed. 100% designed like this so you spend money. Well not me. Deleted. As with candy crush take your game and SHOVE IT!!!!",
            "fun till it started cheatingüò°When it starts cheating again I will uninstall it again. It is ok for awhile then it cheats. Funny that the cheating starts when a player reaches higher levels. I am not going to pay for gold bars I have \"WON.\" A lot of time is wasted on ads and other nonsense. I spend mote time watching dumb ads than playing...boo!"

            "Only 3 stars because I quite enjoy the game, there are alot of ads which I can deal with however you dont get enough lives so you're basically waiting and hoping that the other player hasnt put their phone down so you can play for longer than 5 minutes. My suggestion is either add more lives, or cut down the time to wait for lives. If its going to be a half hour wait to get 1 life, it's not worth my time when I use all 3 in 5-10 minutes.",
            "This is a super great innovative game. I love it. I have always loved the paper version, but to find an app version, this is great. Thank you developers and all who worked hard to make this app possible- From the little guys who are hardly recognized to the CEO or whatever you call your top people.",
            "The game itself is fun! It would be great to have a way to leave comments to your opponent. Some people leave hilarious answers. But the ads are offensive and obnoxious. I understand the need to have ads to support the business, and that I could just pay $3 to remove them. Just beware if your kids want to download it, some of the ads are Rated R.",
            "I REALLY love this game. It's super fast paced, makes me think and I really enjoy the premise of it. However the ads are absolutely terrible. They are constant and long and I know I will soon stop playing the game because of it",
            "The game is fun but very repetitive but it's whatever. I hate how many ads there are and the amount of time they need to run before you can exit out from them."
