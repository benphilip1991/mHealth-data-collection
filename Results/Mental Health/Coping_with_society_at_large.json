            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 üåü is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

Lately, when trying to locate another phone on our plan, it can only tell me the county that the phone is in - which is absolutely useless information. Other times, it can't locate the phone at all. AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

            "This app does not work. I called AT&T three times and it still not working. Keep getting the same error message \" The system is currenrly unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "You'll hear this a lot. Game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ready to spend time to build your own little city you can do it without any diamonds, premium currency. Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

It's weird that you have to use gems for outfits the he apparently bought for you. You have to use diomands to flirt, have sex, go on a date; pretty much anything to make the storyline interesting will cost you diamonds, a lot of diomands!",

I've updated the app today & I've not played since morning bcoz of the problem I've spoken of . So plz help me fix it up so that I can at least play it tomorrow or the day after plz! Plz!

Since I'm using my house WiFi and it's speed but from today it has problems. If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",

But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

            "I loved the app until it started draining my battery. And when I did a maintenance to make it stop draining the battery, the app stopped working altogether. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling in order to make the app work. Then it starts draining my battery again. That sucks! First edition that I installed prior to this new one did not do that.",
            "Ive been using this app for years. This app used to open the screen automatically with the \"STOP\" button at the bottom when the alarm went off. Now the alarm goes off and nothing comes up on the screen anymore, I have to open the app and wade through the ads before I can open the alarm itself and turn it off. About 30 to 45 seconds of the alarm bells ringing before silence. Not feeling this at 0500 anymore. Please fix this issue. Im about to switch apps.",
            "A good app, I am considering buying the full version when I have a decent phone. The only thing I would add/change is the 'Fade in' time; it would be ideal to have an option to adjust the 'fade in' time. Personally, I prefer to have the alarm 'fade in' period set at 5 minutes: the current 'fade in' setting does not give me enough time to switch off the alarm calm and collected, instead I fumble and create a noise waking everyone up. Having said that, it is still a good app.",
            "It works really great as an alarm clock and it's the only one that can wake me up but it's super glitchy. Like sometimes alarms won't go off and sometimes alarms will go off at random times. Sometimes alarms will go off at the wrong time so my experience it works well as an alarm clock and it can wake you up amazingly but is super glitchy.",
            "Pretty intuitive. Only cons - lots of ads & notifications drop bar says wrong day (for the alarm) sometimes. Ex: I set an alarm last night, for the following morning; woke up prior to the alarm going off and in the pull down, the alarm says: \"next alarm set for tomorrow at 7:45.\" (When in actuality, it is only hours away, not over 24 hours away..)"

            "Very confusing. Every time I try to login I have to change my password. Takes me forever to accomplish anything with ATT. I uninstalled this app, could not get it to let me in. Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!üò†üò†üò°üò§ OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. üôÑ",
            "After the latest updates seems they changed the format like where now you can't randomly choose a particular search area and for another instance you cannot unlike any of your ( likes) unless you're a paid member or unless only the person you had liked)pops up when you open the app,, then and only then you can choose to unlike the person or pay membership fee.."

If you want to do a subscription service, just do a subscription service. Don't tell people it's free when it's not. Even the worst freemium apps give you some time, but this app hits you with a paywall within 30 mins of signing up. The other dating apps are bad, but this is the worst of the lot.",

It takes now takes an inordinate amount of time to go from Alerts to Carousel, and from writing a message back to a picture. Writing a message does not show up in a timely manner. More errors exist but you get the idea. Do yourselves a favor, reissue the previous version!",

            "The game was amazing. But when I hit level 12 it did not let me go to the next level. I played level 12 about 5 times. It only let me play levels 1-12. Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",
            "At first this game was really fun, but then when i finished level 12 it asked me to rate it and there was no \"later\" option as there usually is so i rated the game and when i got back to the game to continue playing, i had to do the level all over again, so i did, and then the same thing happened after i finished the level for the second time. I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",
            "I love this game. Because of quarantine I have a lot of free time and this game helps m kill that time. I love that the ads are somewhat limited. The only thing I don't like is that is makes you watch an ad when you got the help buttun. Would definitely recommend üòâ",
            "Really good game. Excellent puzzles to solve 'em swiftly. So many details, so many colors and numbers. That's fine. Grafphic is 4/5, can be better, but that's ok. It is really funny to solve so many puzzles. But actually, there' re too less rooms, only 12. Am waiting for the next upd.",
            "This is game is fun! Why? -because you can use your minds to solve many things and can play this game offline! What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw! You must download this app !"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse?

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

They make u go thru 4-5 pages & u have to fill out your information & number & keep asking over & over for extra confirmation to cancel the free trial. That's so aggravating.

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened üòî. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",

            "Crashing and stuck in a loop. Asked for verification although was already verified. Had to do it hundreds of times for it to finally accept, but now it's asking for a password reset, but I log in through Facebook so it's automatic, tried changing Facebook password too....nope! Still not allowing me in! Have emailed the one given on this page and no response.",
            "Crashes a lot, Closes all the time and cannot receive messages unless you delete app and download again. Update: I keep getting red flagged and keep getting asked to verify over and over again even though I had several times. This is so stupid. Update again: they won't let me come back in! Saying I need to change passwords but they won't let me! Horrible site. I'm deleting forever and telling others to never use this site.",
            "Extremely disappointed with this app. For whatever I have been flagged twice in a week. Third time within a month. I have already proved I'm one hundred percent real but this time I am trying to verify no matter what I do it's not letting me. I don't want to lose my account because I have many people I talk with. Ridiculous. The biometric is stupid and should be updated.",
            "I was having a great time on the app. I've had it for a few years now and have gotten a few good dates off of it. Now the verification process won't let me back into my account though. I've been asked to verify twice in one week. The most recent time I was verified by picture then it asked me to change my password. Problem is I signed up with Facebook and therefore do not use a password to log in. I emailed a few times trying to resolve this issue and still am locked out.",
            "Crashes constantly when microphone or camera permissions are denied. Randomly opens these video feeds in the corner of the screen, not sure if they're some kind of ad or someone's live stream since there's no explanation for them, but not fond of them randomly opening like that if they are live feeds, especially if it is opening up my camera and mic when it does it, but again, there's no explanation, so I've just been closing them."

            "It's a fun game, however I frequently get ripped off when I hit jackpots. It doesn't always give them even if you get them. Also, my boyfriend signed in as a guest and he gets an option to watch videos for coins. I signed in through Facebook and I don't have that option. He gets 17 million per video. Why is this not an option for me? I want to continue playing but if the payout doesn't get better I'll have no choice but to delete.",
            "This is a pretty good game I bought points a few times but usually I can win enough to stay playing as long as I'd like. I think that every app should have a real jackpot or sweepstake, something monterrey . It not something thats challenging, not rocket science. So I feel like its robbing my time. They certainly want to sell. Just give nothing back. Its a scam, really we are the idiots. LOL. Michelle Grace",
            "The best game out there. Just like every game I try, I was skeptical at 1st. They give you videos to watch where your coin awards increase as you level up. Those rewards become very genereous. I havent found any game that comes close. You have other rewards such as slot cards where you get coins for completing albums and use your duplicate slot cards for the wheel of stars which gives you more coins and daily dashes and more free rewards. Their slot games are fun and engaging. Give it a try.",
            "When I first started playing the game it was GREAT, you win some and you lose some. Now they have put a fix on the game to get you to spend more money because it jumps a lot from wins and it's like something was changed. I have played for hours and only won Big 2-3 times."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers ü§ò‚úåüòé",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."

            "Its a really good game, the two reasons I chose 4 stars is well.... lets just get right to it, number 1, when i get on the loading screen it kicks me out and thats happened all the time. But if go in it again it works. Number 2, im kinda sad that the part-time-workers from beggar life are not there :( But otherwise everythings amazing!",
            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",
            "Amazing idle game. It's like other idle games except it has buildings to purchase. A city you can go into with multiple things to do. And not filled with a ton of ads like Alot of other games. I personally love this game and the people who made it. Well that's all. Great game.",
            "Dev replied with game requiring \"minimum rights\". Here is what they want from you when you start the game. Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",
            "Some ads are just a picture with 0 seconds and the game thinks I did not watch an ad, so I get 0 mana (failed to view ad) Please fix! I am really enjoying the game. I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

            "Not the best game play. Gets boring quick. You get 3 swords per day which are necessary to clear land. Game play is limited to clicking on items on the beach which have various time limits or growing crops which also have time limits. No way to increase your number of workers unless you stumble upon one clearing land. All in all it could be better with some work from the programmers.",
            "Money or nothing. I normally just uninstall a game and find another if I dislike it, but this game is just too awful. From the very start, unless you spend real money, you will get nowhere in this game. You need machetes to do pretty much anything. However, you have to buy them. Ads for them are annoying and pop up often. I have spent hours trying to get them for free. Nothing. Well, I found ONE. So, if you want to play this game, have your money ready.",
            "this game could be an awsome game, BUT it is consistently freezing up or just stops playing, and then you loss so many swords trying to get back the quests that you've done and lost, and gold, thens there's the constant reboot of the same queats you already have . now I do understand this for those that have missed them to beable to do them, but come on , with those of us that have them can't we bypass them ( instead of wasting swords and gold ) . and there more , but I only have limitedtime",
            "Played for about a month. Game is quite unstable. Characters travel too slowly between tasks. Too many popups at game initiation. Popup saying everyone is busy you have to physically close is wholly unnecessary. Someone is always \"tinkering with the server\" making game unavailable for many hours, as long as an entire day.",
            "I installed it only to find that they want to be able to make and manage phone calls to even start the game. Why do you need to make phone calls? This is my tablet and I don't want you managing anything like that! That dialog box also hides why you need my email and device ID. I just saw your response! I am so impressed a human being answered and that it was a clear answer! I don't invite friends, and I really think that there should be an option to not give that information. Thx!"

            "Water plots takes too long to get. You can only get ropes, anchors, and hooks from trailor park Nick. He mostly gives you ropes. So I gave up on that. Also it takes 8 hours to get one freaking shovel !! Also the pad locks, shovels, and nails should not be included in the barn items. They take up too much room. If you can't sell it then it shouldn't be in there. Store it somewhere else.",
            "I have played this game for a long time. I can't tell if you are trying to get players or loose players. Every event, animal add on, and ect; you ask for 6 or more of the same thing, constantly repeating, everything requesting the same material to finish the product. The problem has got so bad you are loosing players because they can't get ahead or finish anything and no help from co-op, they're in the same boat. Please understand you are loosing players not gaining players.",
            "This was a great game until, it started freezing, before this whenever I started the game it used to freeze for 5 sec and the game ran properly thereafter. But now it keeps on freezing many a times. And even I updated the game thinking that, this was happening cuz I didn't update for a long time, but I was wrong. I don't know why this is happening, otherwise I loved playing this game, particularly.",
            "It would have had a higher rate but since the wild animal farm showed up i can't play my game, it freezes in one spot and I have tried Uninstalling it and reloading the game, i have tried to contact support and it won't let me get through to support. I am not happy and in the past I loved playing this game. PLEASE FIX or i will no longer play the game.",
            "Game play is slow, difficult to water plants and feed livestock, the button doesn't respond or work. I've already submitted a report but it has not been addressed or fixed yet. This game has a lot of bugs that makes playing such a chore and taking the fun out of it. What happened to you guys? Update: Two updates were added 10/09/20. Only lasted a full minute before returning to its slow-mo pace. Can you recommend another alternate game, until you get your stuff together? Just saying..ü§∑"

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user ü•≤",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "Don't get me wrong for rating the app with one star, I do love this app but, the problems are the ads, and when I tried to subscribe, it said I can't do it at the moment, so when I checked the app store for the apps that are (subscribed) the only one that showed up was viki. And guess what? I still have got few weeks until the subscribtion expires but still all the shows and movies are locked, so please tell me what is going on and what is the problem here",
            "Im unable to fastforward drama or backward it,each time i leave the app to do something when I'm back i have to start the same episode from the begining pls fix this,i appreciate your efforts on this app but still needs to do better,it is really annoying.",
            "I really like this app! My main concern is the advertisements. Okay, I'm actually not too bothered by how frequent they are, I'm a patient person and I understand that's how the app is able to run, but sometimes the ad has trouble loading and freezes. A 30 second ad will have me wait two minutes bc it takes so long to load. And I know I can get vikiplus to avoid ads but I'm poor. Besides that, the quality of the dramas are clear and the captions are well made!",
            "It's really wonderful application .it's help to find lots of drama here. Am satisfied with this.but the problem is with resolution because we can't adjust what we want, sometimes network can't help to watch in that time we only can help with adjust the resolution but here there is no adjustments in this application!. can you fix with that others wise it's a good appüëç"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

Ads only happen if you want to make a bit of in-game cash. I would like to know what an upgrade will get me. \"Improved performance\" and \"more crafting options\" doesn't shed much light on what higher level buildings can do. Haven't found uranium yet.",
            "This game is calm and way different from all those moneysucking mobile games. No annoying ads unless you want some extra currency or speed up some progress. It's amazing how much you can do. There's always something new to explore etc. Its only downside is that the gameplay is extremely slow, but it also has its charms: it gives a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of the road. Dear developer, if you see this, just know that i love your work and can't wait to see what comes next.",
            "The game is a work in progress and so it has a few bugs and minor issues which do not affect the overall gameplay experience. This game is not marred by paywalls intrusive pop up ads. All of the content in the game can be enjoyed by players regardless of their budget. It is a difficut game to get the hang of and so a discord group has been created by the developer to assist players in progressing through the game and allowing them to socialize with other players.",
            "Lots of bugs. Lacks instruction. I have everything that is says for Hydroponics (something needed for the game) yet fails to let me make it. Do I need to research something fails to tell me in the game. There is no close button when you open menus in the game. Pressing on top where close button should be works. Fun game too bad it's so clunky. Five out of five if you fix the issues...",
            "It's a fun game and I like the idea but the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the UI. It jitters when you switch outposts and doesn't register half my taps, meaning you have to press the button twice for it to do something. Developers, if you're reading this, please improve the UI! Make it less jiterry and clunky and I'll up my review to 5 stars."

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great ‚Äî the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash ‚Äî even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Worst texting app for many reasons, first of all I earn credits but it uses them if I receive messages, but worst of all it makes bots to text you to use up all your credits, I've had over 60 credits and now all gone because they put bots to take your credits for receiving messages. You sometimes dont even get your messages on time at all. The offers never work. Worst texting app and if you wanted to text or call you might as well pay for a carrier service. Dont install or waste your time....",
            "This app is really great if you know your email password. But, I finally found mine, and used it, and this app is great! You can call and text. obviously. But you just watch videos to get credits, and watchibg videos to talk to people isn't bad compared to paying each month. This app os great. LOVE IT!!!!",
            "Typical Wifi texting App, filled with Ads nonstop and left to right. I forgot when I re-downloaded this you have to have \"credits\" that expire every 48 hours to text anything or call anyone which is so stupid. To get more credits you have to, you guessed it sit through 15 second to 1 minute adds for half a credit to 1 full credit each. I would've skipped the download button and tried remembering which other App is the REAL free one and doesn't use credits. Don't download, find other free one.",
            "I accidentally un install the apps, I tried to install again and log in my email address but I can't log in even if I click the forgot pass word. Please help me. This is my second time, before you don't take an action about my problem on this apps. All my credit I didn't use it. Waste of time.. grrrr. I will rate your apps if you fix my problem.",
            "I'm only giving 4stars easy to understand and set up, but I haven't tried calling with it, and have not received any calls yet, I'll be sure to edit the rating for you, ü§û,ok I have had this app for a while now and I absolutely love it, clear calling, easy to use and understand, I have shared with many friends and family, keep up the good work and THANK YOU üòâüòâ"

It shows people online while they aren't. 3 of my female friends haven't use the app for 2 weeks and shows them online. Sending messages on its own. I received messages from people and when i talk to them they have no idea",

Spammed with click bait that takes you to dubious porn site, you receive messages from members who haven't been online in months/years, fake profiles, blah blah you have pretty much every flaw you can expect from free to join apps. Ruins your faith in the app so much, that unless you got money to burn, it's pointless to throw them free money. Think I'm exaggerating? Download the app yourself and see how many days it takes you to uninstall! I lasted a week",

Even if you've sent them a message, want to like them, eager to meet: Nope you took 0.3 seconds longer than allowed to write your message they are gone! With no profile data at all it is purely swiping on a single photo. Also populated with bots and professionals selling themselves"

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

Also give a feature to add our own domain in the free plan, because it will show the app's ad and also the domain. Why ??? Also add a feature to share PDFs and documents in the groups...Please add this feature and I am sure for a 5-star review...",
            "This app is horrible, avoid it like the plague. I know they meant good but it is a mess will just waste your MBs. 1) I can't find or access my sites.it just asks me to create a new one. 2) Takes ages to just load the help page. 3) Their solution to fixing the problem is them just telling you that you logged in with the wrong email address. I think adding an \"Import/Re-import your site(s)\" button would be a better solution.",
            "This app is terrible... it takes an hour to add 1 product. Maybe. The amount of time I waste taking photos, retaking photos, upload failed repeatedly, close app, start over, etc. Is infuriating!!! As a small maker business, I have a ton of one of a kind items I just cannot list. Because I cannot get them listed! Most of my stuff is on etsy because I don't have any other choice. And to top it all off, I have to start my listings at the computer then try to upload the photos on my phone.",
            "It's a little intimidating at first to start, but once you begin toggling with the settings and features it starts to slowly form. I honestly should watch some tips and tricks videos to see how to make my website just how I want it. I honestly have been trying to get a friend to get interested in me, but no takers yet! I have used Wix programming since 2010 for high school studio art.",
            "Started using WIX to build websites using a computer because the online website builder is one of the best I've come across. But as many of our club members only use a smartphone, not a computer, I thought the WIX mobile app would make life easier. NOT SO! When a member builds his profile on a computer, it automatically shows up on the app version. But not the other way around. If you add a photo to your profile on the app, it doesn't appear on the website version. This needs fixing!"

I sent a report to you guys and never got a response. I would give 0 stars. Horrible non-existent customer service",

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ‚ù§ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT üëçüëçüëçüëç",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 üíé and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ‚ô°"

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "This game deserves a million stars out of five. The chance to visit another village is like visiting another planet. Mindblowing those villages are. That the game goes from night to day synchronized to the actual diurnal nocturnal quotidian circadian algorithm of natural time actually brought me to tears, in a good way. The spirit of the medieval forest is present in this smurfy app. Smurfeat emptor: October 30 2020. Paid $6.81 for lunar new year dragon and did not get it. App snapped off after.",
            "Played this game years ago and missed it, had to come back. Yes, there are glitches. Read up on how to manually save your game. The extra attention is worth it. The game is super cute, I found game support to be helpful when I had an issue. It's the only game I happily spend real money on, much to my husbands chagrin muaha! Love the development, the graphics, being able to create my village. Each day I look forward to opening up my village and working on it makes me smile.",
            "Super cute!! Look forward to playing with my favorite Smurfs everyday. Love the new updates and graphics. One issue I don't like is somethings are worth more money than the smurf huts, like how Fairy Prince Garth is normally worth $24.99. I don't think somethings will be worth the price we're paying. Other than that, the game is so worth playing or at least taking a look at.",
            "I wish i could do 0 stars. I had a huge village, including other locations like the grove etc. But It doesn't save anything after i last downloaded it. No new buildings, anything i place in a garden bed, it's just gone whenever i open the app again, even if it only been a few minutes.",
            "Excellent gameplay. You will not get bored if you play online or offline. Everytime more interesting things are coming...but for suggestion i just suggest that improve gameplay for story line and make more story thinkful and adventures."

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",

            "Loved this game at first, but when you get to the higher levels the tasks are too complex, takes along time to gather resources that you need and why is it whenever you need a particular item, it is NEVER available in the market... I know, so we have to spend (actual) money to progress in the game. Good game, but designed so you have to purchase to further your game. Uninstalling...",
            "I've been playing for 4 years and playing city wars. Now I'm not because there's too much items to make of too many varieties that takes hours to produce. It will make a player lose interest real fast especially in wars. A lot of time for little payoff. You have to make too many items to receive war items and get out of shield. I'm level 50 and have 335 storage. So this is more of a complaint than anything I guess. Just chasing the dragon. Good game but extremely time consuming. Extremely!",
            "The game is pretty fun, once you get the city hall and trade depot you can get simoleons faster. One problem I have is that it keep asking me to sing in to my Google play games account Everytime I enter the game. I don't know why this is a think but I would love some help with this problem. But to you new players out there, remember not to build residential too fast or you might run out of things like power and water. So make sure you built power plants and water plants.",
            "The game goads you into building more than you can afford before you realize you can't afford it, and then you have to wait for money to come in ‚Äì very slowly ‚Äì before you can build things you didn't know you needed at the time. And you can't scrap everything and start all over, unless you haven't connected the game with your Google account or Facebook. The only way to start over in that case is to demolish everything in the existing City. If they could fix those things, the game would be great.",
            "This game is a very exciting game I enjoyed it in the past few years to the extent that I reached level 62. But I'm sorry for not given you guys 5 stars because my storage on my phone became low so I had to delete some apps and files on my phone. But I did it because I knew that when I install it again my progress would be restored but it did not happen that way. Because I didn't understand I always saved my progress. But without any doubt this game is an interesting game and uses a lot of time"

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",

I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "Bring your wallet 50 million rubies to play outers ridiculous and absurd to keep my comments civil. Been playing for 3 years .your going to lose a lot of dedicated players. Good luck \"good game\" you might want to change your name to rich people game. The latest update fixed this problem still a buyerd game . Unless u get with a good alliance like mine.",
            "GG not nice about counts expiring unless you financially support them. Went through period of no access. Finally resolved with full deletion and reinstall of game. Finally after multiple months of updates not fixing issue. When game runs it is a pleasure. Good time passer. Always something to do",

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

Its so helpful with parents. You can add everyone to your band and set things how you want them. They even have a live streaming option, polls, attendance and sooo much more. I will always use band for any group stuff I may have.",
            "I love the original Band App. It works so well from. My team at work and our daughters softball team to communicate with the parents. I recently downloaded the BAND FOR KIDS for my daughter to talk to her teammates, it hasn't worked yet. I have paid 2 different times, $.50 and I still can't make it work.",
            "Great app--has essentially transformed our group's communication. Feature request: Please allow toggling the visibility of calendars within a Band. If we have multiple calendars created for different purposes, it would be nice to be able to declutter the agenda view by hiding events from irrelevant calendars. Also, please let us specify an individual calendar (when there are multiple) from a specific band when we are creating a widget. Thank you, developers!",

This could be a great app if you would FIX the problems. Seems like everyone has the same issues. I've been with metro for about 10yrs.",

Tried getting them to fix the problem three times but they don't know how to do it!!! Will probably have to uninstall the app, lose all of my archived messages and pic's and reinstall to see what happens. Also, NEVER set your permissions to ALL! Doing so will let messenger change your contact list, phone call information, distributes private info also!!",

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",
            "I've been playing ALL the Bubble Witches for years now and I COMPLETELY fell in love with all of them! ü•∞ I have a panic disorder and these games help so much to soothe my anxieties and let me focus on the fun! I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldronsüíû EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL üí´üîÆ",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to üëç. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "It's a great app. But it has a serious problem that some of their screen types do not rotate on Arduino devices, including on Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e and S6 that I'm using, or on the A71 and S20. It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",
            "Update: Previous issues have been resolved, thanks! I'm having a few other problems though - when adding new items to the board I can't subscribe other members to this item (I can do this on my computer so I have the permissions), also tags not activating on updates, and I can't find the option to edit updates. Thank you!",
            "Just when I was setting up the boards and telling my team to download this amazing app. Barely 30 mins in, it decides to delete my board and stop working. All my work down the drain.",
            "By far the best project/team management app I've used. The way it integrates the columns together and the ability to switch between different views are excellent features I have yet to see on any other platform.",
            "The inability to customise the date format is very frustrating and leads to confusion as the ROTW uses dd/mm/yyyy but the app is locked into American style. Please add this feature, it's available on the desktop."

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",

I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "I loved the game at first I even made it to level 50. However, after months of playing the game investing my time and money it rebooted and made me start over from level 1. They took away my home and Sims family. I was so disappointed. They have since fixed this problem and returned my level and items. I love this game.",
            "Ok. I like this game. But one thing that i really don't like is that they don't notify us of new updates in the game. I would have to go to playstore everytime i suspect there's new updates. Sometimes i would have missed more than a week during an event before i update and i miss good products. So I really hope they would change that and notify us within the game. Otherwise i love it.",
            "I love the game but some things are still quite annoying in it, like the challenges, some are impossible to get unless you make use of real money to purchase sim cash. It think they should make the challenges quite easier to win reward becos some people can't always afford that. I am also hoping to see pets and cars in the game. By the way nice one EA and Maxis",
            "Quite good mobile adaptation of The Sims game. Enjoyable. -- Problem though: My Sim is female but Izzy designed male clothes for me on the first try, and still male on the second try. My starter Fashion Gems all wasted since females can't wear male clothes. Suggestions: 1) make Izzy able to detect the current Sim's gender or allow us to choose. 2) State the requirements of player's name so that we don't have to keep guessing why it gets rejected.",
            "Have all sims in collection. All great only complaint in this game is the loading and the none selling of items in storage.Be good if could add more sims. Over all great game. Am enjoying it. If the situations were resolved i would give a 5 stars. cheers.."

            "Enjoying playing the game. It's so addicting I'm going to have to set a timer. I really like the game but I continually get a network error then the game reloads. With the help of Emma's Adventures tech I no longer have problems. I unplugged my router for about three minutes then plugged it back in. After getting back online, everything is running smoothly. In the future, I'll unplug and see if thar fixes the problem before driving the tech crazy with all my messages to them for help.",
            "I like the challenges and how you build up your town the way you want it . I have been playing this game for a while now and still like it but 2 major issues . The ships that come in you should have the same option as the train to let it go even if you haven't filled it . The guild is not great most of the time its too hard to help people compared to other games such as township in that game being part of a guild is what makes the game fantastic. a few changes would make it fun and enjoyable.",
            "So far the best game I have played from play store. I have not spent any money. I am level 53. They always add more content to keep playing. Not everyone will like this game because we are all different. Most people will find it just fine. It is not a pay to play game but if you like it...you can support the developers by buying things if you wish to. I have received no compensation for this review nor do I want it. This is a great game!",
            "Very slow. Not able to advance as quick as I would like to. Stuck on home, going around the crops and animals, since started. Unable to go to other areas without getting stuck. !!!!! Has improved a lot. / Hate it when it goes off while playing at a good moment..... One problem is as I am working on this game, it switches off. So frustrating üò° . How long will I have to put up with this?",
            "I really like this game but the further you progress in the game, the more energy points it takes to do anything. You spend all your time filling orders just to kill time until you have enough energy to actually play the levels. And then you only have enough energy to clear a bush or two and then wait for an hour. Clear a bush, wait an hour. It becomes far too tedious to want to continue."

            "While I have always backed up my photos on Google Drive, it's nice to have the Amazon Photos complete backup as a failsafe. However, Google's photo software is not usable, and Amazon Photos has a couple of features that are outstanding. The user can place selected photos into any number of albums. An album can be selected as your tv screen saver. More importantly, it can be sent in an email, allowing the receiver to view all the photos in the album, hundreds if desired, with a single email.",
            "I love how everything syncs to one place. Amazon photos puts different people in their own little album, so its really convenient if you are needing a picture of a certain someone all you have to do is go to their album and any picture you've ever taken and they are in it (even way in the background) it'll be in their. My boys looked identical as babies and we were so surprised amazon could recognize which one was who. Its also nice to have memories pop up from the same day 1-5years ago.",
            "Since my Kindle HDX DIED with years of photos I couldn't print on it., This Amazing Amazon Photos APP helped me reconnect with the Majority most of the photos that were backed up.. This APP actually helped me reconnect with some photos I hadn't seen in years, because I hadn't realized that my photos were being Backed up each time I plugged it in to recharge the battery. So grateful for that. THANKS AMAZON üê∏üíñSTILL accurate information. I can STILL can go back to pictures I took 5+ years ago. A",
            "I was invited by a friend to share pictures on this app. I thought what a cool idea. I HATE that this app copies all the pictures on my phone, and stores them. Now every picture i take goes to three apps: Gallery, Google Photos, and to Amazon Prime Photos! I also HATE that there is NO left navigational plane foe me to get into the trash can",
            "Amazon photos is not only easy, it is convenient, take a photo and it instantly comes up on my Echo Show, it's like having a moving picture frame!! Also can watch on the TV and my Amazon tablet besides the Echo Show. Paid for additional photo and video storage, compared to having them printed!!"

            "This app has gotten so much worse than before. $45 for 1 month of Basic? It was at least 3 times cheaper than that barely a few months ago? And you only get to match like 8 people before you have to wait 16 hours versus the like 30 something people you used to be able to match. I won't be using this app until it is back to normal.",
            "I have been using this app for 5 years. I met most interesting people of my life here. But unfortunately lately it seems there is an active force to strip down OKCUPID from its beautiful and distinctive features. So the changes are often to make the application worse. Examples: sweep culture. Mixing all the questions which used to be separate groups. Now blending matches in so called \"your turn, their turn\"",
            "Read the reviews. This app is a money pit. When you first register, you'd be barraged with so many LIKES that you start thinking it just might work. The next thing you know, you're subscribed. Suddenly there aren't any more LIKES and the only ones you get are from places you specified you didn't want. What gives? Their 'match' algorithm is definitely off too and it would seem a lot of people are inactive users. Bottom line, don't download. Not worth the time or money.",
            "OKcupid used to be the best app to meet new people, for romance or friendship. However it regressed during the years into another boring swipe centred app. I used to be able to meet people which I had interests in common with, now you are locked into the 15 recommended profiles which you have to swipe if you want to get more, while before you could check out hundreds. Very disappointed in it. At least they should make the old layout available.",
            "It's ok, but not as good as it use to be, because now you can't browse, it's all swiping which is not what humans should be doing. It's turning into Tinder! Some of the questions are idiotic and totally unnecessary. App has bugs, you have to keep closing and clearing Ram for it to work properly, and the preferences don't work at all. It shows me women not in my age range or even distance, so it's pointless using the app. I have now deleted as it's not worth the time."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",
            "Yelp has gotten worse then GOOGLE search when it comes to searching for the nearest business you search for. Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",

One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ‚ù§Ô∏è I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap üòâ ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

Over time it got more and more bloated, plastered with ads and no longer being able to select the sources. I think this last update is the straw that breaks the camel's back. I do not like the new look at all. I have used this app since it came out but I'm off to find greener pastures, the app has lost everything that made it stand out from any other news portal.",
            "Keeps going downhill. This used to be the best news app out there. Now all the forced adds you can't close until timer runs down, make it almost unusable. You already mix adds in with articles then force MORE ADDS on top of that..RIDICULOUS! Suggestion you wanted: Don't add a timers to adds. That just pisses people off. Don't act like this is an acceptable alternative to a subscription fee. Good luck trying to charge one to view other news source's articles.",
            "Love this app. Absolutely hate the new format of the top news tab.Originally I took off just 2 stars, but it just bugs.me so much I hate it. Wish they would put it back the way it was or have the option. ******EDIT****** Rating from 1 to 5 stars. the top news tab had changed so that pictures for each story were large and I could only have 1 headline on screen at a time.So I had to scroll a lot just to scim through.They have put it back to they way it was before! Mostly. Ads are big but thats OK",
            "The ads are minimal (make your money, booboo) But I originally downloaded the app because I thought it cast a wide net of views, but it feels like its just giving me more of what I regularly click on. Still, I get enough to feel tired of the world, which is really all I want from a news app anyway. Good job, persons.",
            "Seems to be excellent... Since my original review, some of the news options come out of left field (crazy). Also when reviewing articles, nonsense symbols show up in the body of text, sometimes making it unreadable. e.g. \"eadquarters√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTrump Store,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ\" So, lose a star on the rating scale."

            "As the old saying goes \"don't fix it if it ain't broke\". Previously, users were able to choose where to save an article, now the article is automatically saved to the list \"Saved\". Now, if users want to circumvent such automatic saving, you added the options \"Add to another...\", \"Move from...\" and \"Remove from...\" --- problem with that is that these options COULD ALL BE TRIVIALIZED if the previous system was still in place.",
            "After using wikipedia app for about 2 years, I've been encountered some problem,first when you want to read the article that has been saved,sometimes it doesn't load at all,and tell me that i do not connected to the internet even though i already downloaded it,two when it successfully load the page there are some photos that's not loaded,so i don't really know the context of the description of the pictures",
            "Love this app, love wikipedia. Far better than searching Wikipedia articles in a browser on mobile. It's easy to use and the in-page seach function is particularly useful, as well as the quick introduction pieces you would normally only be able to access by hovering over a link on a PC or laptop. The quick edits are pretty good, if I'm bored I might steamroller through a couple of image captions or article descriptions. I also enjoy reading the main page in the morning.",
            "Five stars when the many bugs in the latest version (as of 2020-10-29) are corrected. A pleasure to browse, when working! For now, though: üî∏ I've tested on several devices. The 'loading' animation is endless, and the first paragraph or more is missing. Also, it's now hard to get to History.",
            "Wikipedia is the best thing on the internet. Keep this app on your phone and you will benifit from it. App layout is very nice and clean. Articles can be saved offline and synched across devices. You can customize font size, page color and change language of article."

            "Used to be perfect. Everything was working fine until the updates came. All of a sudden I am unable to connect my phone to PC. Both devices are on the same network. Disabled my firewall just to see if it was the one causing the problem to no avail. Reinstalled both on my PC and phone, still didn't work. Even tried relogging into my Microsoft account on both devices, still didn't work. This was the same for the Microsoft Launcher. Stay away. Both software are unusable unless the bugs are fixed.",
            "Awful, it doesn't work 90% of the time. It disconnects for no reason, says that you aren't on the same network when you are, etc. I found a fix for this by restarting the app on pc but now that doesn't work anymore because I can't even open the app. Everytime I try to open it(on pc) it starts with the normal loading screen but then it just minimizes itself and I can't open it again. I've tried restarting, different wifis, redownloading and checked for updates. Nothing works. Terrible app!",
            "Just like many other reviews. Used to be perfect. Everything was working fine until the updates came. All of a sudden I am unable to connect my phone to PC. Both devices are on the same network. Reinstalled both applications on my PC and phone. On the OPC side it seemed to hang at 60% on my my phone it said select send notification, this will send the final permission to your phone but, because the PC was stuck at 60% I could never select this option.",
            "The app regularly decides not to communicate with the laptop. The \"advice\" is worthless. When it works, I love it. I cannot depend on it at all. I have updated, reinstalled, opened settings and turned things off and back on again. It still randomly disconnects and refuses to reconnect. Then one day, it works again. Don't rely on this app.",
            "Went through the setup process fine, but it's never successfully connected since. Both devices are on the same network. Tried to look up the error code on the Microsoft support page, but the page keeps auto-appending \"Your Phone app\" onto the search terms I enter and giving me useless results. I don't normally take the time to review apps, but this one is a terrible experience the whole way through. Seeing \"Rate us 5 stars\" at the top of the system menu was what pushed me to it."

I asked my friends and they told me it also occurs with them. I can't even order. Plus the attendance is the worse. I lost one account because I lost my old phone and the number was gone as well, then I couldn't recover it, I asked for help and the support never came. iFood never did that to me.",
            "I pay for the monthly pass... And I am pissed off because it won't connect. And yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've turned my phone one and off.... I needed up using Doordash with no problems only it cost me more money because I don't have a pass there. I'd like my 10 bucks back at this point. Uber needs help and no matter who I email I never hear anything back.",
            "After half a year, the app didn't improve. Application is full of bugs. Even cannot register in the system. A Year ago it didn't accept my email address, half a year ago it did, but didn't show the keyboard for the first name/last name fields. Half a year later (oct 2020) still the same issue. Guys, how is it possible to create such a bad app? Shame",
            "Worst app. Doesn't even run properly. App tries to connect to server but can't. After half an hour finally connects and asks for address and looks for food and bang no response. Just the same screen with address option. Looks like it is searching for food in Mars that's why there is no food around me. And the same process repeat again and again.",

Otherwise I get the same message \"try again\" and no matter how many times you click it , it won't open the app. I have a brand new S20 Ultra and it hasn't worked on my previous android wither."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

If you are lookn' for an app, that will work with any printer, that you use at home and maybe, for your work, this app from Mopria, will work for you! 100% for most printers from Brother‚ôæEpson‚ôæHP‚ôæEtc...So, if you cannot find the right plugin or app, try Mopria! It will work, for you!",
            "I love this app it always find my printer when my actual printer name with his brothers black and white printer and and sometimes it won't find it but mopia print all always locate my brother's black and white printer I love this app is great it deserves more than a five star in my opinion I have no problem with it and it's so easy to use thank you very much. I'm very satisfied user,",
            "Only 5 minutes ago (12.40 hrs) I downloaded this app, because my new Huawei p20 Pro was not printing, but I was able to print the same item using my laptop. I have the HP 5520 all in one printer, I printed off the test page which printed BLANK! GOOD START. I have just tried another 2 different prints, both blank pages.. That's from 9/10/18, not used the printer for a while 6 months at least, same bloody thing, no printer, yet it's on your listing, rint page = chuck out blank pages , uninstalled",
            "Used to be awesome Update killed my canon mf240. Support only offered a canned response. Thought it was the phone, tried a brand new phone with the same result... It was fine till the update, nothing wrong on my end. It will connect and recognize the printer over WiFi and direct-connection but when you get to the print screen the icon to start print (blue printer icon) is gone!! Checked print services, cleared cache, all should be well and it's not!! Please fix!!!",
            "Been using this app both on my fire tablet and for the last few days on my Moto G5. It appears to be working VERY well on both devices. Does everything that I want. 5*. Update: Some months later. This app is still working well and has caused no problems at all. Thoroughly recommend."

            "After the new update I can't get into multiplayer! WELL THANKS FOR NOTHING. At first I could stay for a minute or 2. And then I get lagged and it says connection lost when my WiFi is working well. There is nothing wrong with the connection or WiFi it's the game. So I just want to tell you all pls don't update this. Or you will regret it like me. I used to be a multiplayer addict, well I still am. And I'm so sad rn. Please fix this bug. And the report button doesn't even work. ~Thank you",
            "This game deserved 5 stars if there were not too many glitches, lags and bugs but in my opinion if they fixes these bugs than this would totally get 5 stars from me. If we talk about good sites this game is amazing and I love it. It's the best replacement for Minecraft and if you don't have enough money to buy Minecraft or your parents don't allow to than this game is made for you. Personally I play this game whole day and I bet you will love it if you ignore bugs.",
            "It's a good game, but it needs a report button or something to give certain players a warning so that they can be kicked off the server or something bc there's some people who just spam, I lowered one more star because it keeps logging me off the server even though I have absolutely no internet problem with anything else.",
            "Great game played this before tnx for making a game like minecraft because minecraft has to be paid for but i can download minecraft for free i like free games better and most especially Among Us by Innersloth LCC but i also like sandbox games like this too! Love from The Philippines!",

            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",

I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

            "I love the Kindle app! Never thought I would read e-books because I prefer to read a physical copy, but with covid and recently down sizing e-books are so much easier to read, and store! They take up no space. Best of all with the free Kindle app you can read books for free. Other books do cost but you do not have to buy anything to be able to read! Book lovers need this app!",
            "This app is well done as expected from Amazon. However, my biggest frustration is that highlighting is based on whole words and not characters. There are times where I will need to highlight one word and the current highlighting system makes it impossible without highlighting other objects around it. There are apps that allow for character based highlighting. Please change this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",
            "Bug-ridden garbage. Latest update 28/1/19 just marked all my books as new & unread when most of them should be partially or wholly read. So much for \"bug fixes\"! October 2020. There's an expression, \"If it ain't bust, don't fix it.\" Doesn't apply in this case. Definitely bust. Oh, and you'll need a magnifier to see the new Aa menu.",
            "The Kindle icon recently disappeared from my screen, so I reinstalled the app. The icon has re-appeared, but when I try to open any book from my library I get a message saying that Kindle has closed. Kindle no longer works on my device (Google Nexus). Does this have anything to do with the upgrade on 15th October ? If this isn't fixed soon I'm going to be asking for a refund for all the Kindle books in my library. Not happy.",
            "App itself is ok, latest update is hot garbage. Honestly I'm amazed they haven't hotfixed it yet, considering all the people who can't use the store at all right now. Pretty tired of getting push notifications, only to select them and get an error when it tries to display a store page. My other major annoyance at the moment - they decided to default to autoscroll instead of page flip, even when you've previously turned it off. How hard is it to just set it according to what the user specified?"

            "This is the absolute best slots game, that I have ever played. The graphics, in the games are unique and the wins play better than all so far. I find myself playing for hours when I have the coins to do so. When you win a large jackpot it makes it harder to put down. Still playing for hour's on my favorite game. I recently deleted 4 other games, because they don't compare.",
            "Fun and addictive. But you run out of free coins really fast!!! It would be nice if they would offer more ways to earn them. Once you run out of free spins, which is REALLY fast, you have to buy coins to play!!! It sux!!! And if you're like me, you know that to win more you HAVE to do a MAX BET!!! That is where they get you!!! You use up all of your free spins this way!! THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE SPINS!!! DONT GET SUCKED IN LIKE I DID!!! IT ISN'T WORTH IT!!!!",
            "Played for months, spent probably around $1,000 on packages...having fun. I understand it is a play-to-win game and so I had no problem making the occasional purchase - but recently their greed has just gotten to be too much. The way the game is programmed to purposely work against you to force more purchases has taken any fun or sense of the excitement out of the game. They aren't even coy about it; it's just blatant and irritating. I won't be spending another penny on any Playtika games.",
            "Here we go again with the app doing more cool features which causes loading issues that go on for months. Always the same advice to uninstall and reinstall which does nothing. It seems this always happens close to tournaments ending so you can't reach the grand prize. Also too many contests going on at the same time, so you are being forced to play. Just what are these \"cool features?\"",
            "Everything in this online casino is about trying to get you to spend money on air. Everytime you switch games you have to navigate through 6 ads begging for money. Enough is enough. One ad is ok two is tollerable but so many ads begging for money is insane. If I was to spend money at an online casino it would be one where I have a chance to win real money. Sorry ceasers but your online casino is well below par in my view."

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

            "Edit. This is a fantastic game, good story, excellent graphics. But. If you are after a game that you can play free more than a few mins a day avoid. I have spent money on gems, a significant amount and they don't progress you though even one level as you get further in the game. If you have massive patience then this game will suit you. If you have unlimited money to spend on germs this game will suit you. Otherwise, avoid. The gem cost increased recently too.",
            "It costs too much (takes too much energy) to complete a task.. when you have a limit or time frame to get certain things done you have to wait until your energy fills back up because to chop a tree takes most of your energy and you can't finish the challenges in enough time I used to love this game until it became more of a job to do everything on time..",
            "I think the concept of the game at least varies somewhat compared to many simulated games around. The issue I have is the payment walls, early on and throughout. I understand this is a business however people need to get into this game before they pay anything if they choose. I feel your payment walls are fast and frequent. The game itself I would give 4 1/2 stars. The payment walls are frustrating, thanks....",
            "I used to love this game, but since the last update, it crashes every time I try to load it. It was fine when I was on the home screen, but once I tried to reach the new map area, and it installed the new update, it crashed and won't load since. There is no way to contact support that I can find, so I guess after a year of playing every day, it seems I'm done.",
            "Its been good so far. The cap for energy is way too low. You can basically only clear one thing before you have to wait for more energy and if its something big you have to wait for energy to hit it 2 or 3 times. After the latest update its taking an hour just for the game to load!! Im about to delete it and find something better. How am i supposed to contact you through the game if i cant get in the game?"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!ü¶â‚ô•Ô∏èüåû‚òÑ‚ö°üíöüíôüíúüí• P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over ¬£10 for an entire year!)"

There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",
            "Bestest ever... Amazing app with ennumber of filters & effects. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it! my all time favorite app. Easy to use and very impressive and the great part is that its almost add free. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like \"Download print issue\" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
            "I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
            "Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
            "App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
            "Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless."

Sometimes the app will suddenly have every item listed as out of stock and you have to restart. When you add items and hit + to increase the number of items it takes forever. Hopefully they fix these issues.",

It took me an hour to fill my cart due to all the bugs and when I finally clicked check out of course that failed too and I lost the last pick-up slot of the day and have to go grocery shopping in the snow now... I have a Samsung Galaxy. The bugs were: search wouldn't work, browse by category wouldn't work, the app kept crashing and removing most of the items in my cart, and when I clicked check out it said \"failed to fetch payment.\"",
            "This app gets slower everytime I use it. It's more like a glitch generator, and an anger creator. But, compared to going inside of that level of hell, there's really no difference, other than not dealing with the public clowns and Karen's. I continue to use this app though. Am I a glutton for punishment, or a slave of this corporate world that is left no other options?......yes.",
            "This ap is FRUSTRATING and is getting worse! The screen constantly freezes, it won't allow you to side swipe when you are supposed to be able to and right in the middle of looking at something the screen will go blank to \"update\" the page and sometimes it will come back up to the page you were on and sometimes take you all the way to the very beginning of opening the ap. And it's not my internet because it's very reliable and the ap does this no matter what service I'm using.",
            "I thought it was me!! I literally bought a new phone to see if it would fix the issues. When uninstalling and reinstalling the app I just happened to take a look at the reviews, lo and behold every single person in the world has the same problem I do since they combined the websites,hece it completely sucks. I like everyone on here I'm going to have to use a different online shopping app for a different store because this app is useless."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

My odt files do not look or format the same on Chromebook (this app) as they do on desktop Open Office, but that might be result of lack of fonts on app. However, advanced users, who pay for full version, can probably make use of this app. Also, if you just need a word processor/office suite on Android for basic documents, this app is perfect.

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",

Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

I typed it in right. It pretty frustrating when you need a ride and can't even access your lyft account for a ride. This has been going of for 2 years now.",
            "Up until tonight Ive loved the app, but as of tonight it charges me for the ride but after I go and order it it just goes back to the select destination screen it doesn't look for a car then it tells me I found a car and be ready in 18 minutes but there's no trace of it inside the app I don't know what's going on right now, I'm very disappointed and kind of stranded not because of this possibly unless this guy just shows up mysteriously in 18 minutes I have no clue if he's going to or not",
            "I have had an account for years but have not used it since 2015. I moved to a new state recently and had re-download lyft and tried to attach my payment methods. I tried to attach every option that is offered and the app wouldn't let me. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. There's is no proper customer service set up. I finally found a number that would keep me on hold then eventually hang up. This is why I prefer uber, I never have these problems with them.",
            "Changed my address a week before downloading. My card didnt match my new address when adding it yet. Understandable. But now that my address is up to date, i still have to use a completely different card. I contacted support who told me my card wasnt working or they dont accept it _. I tried explaining it was my address, they sent me to a link that told me I need to use a new card. Its just very frustdrating. I gave it two stars because the drivers are always awesome and the prices are fair.",
            "Terrible. Added my credit card a day prior and thought it was set to go. Now I request a ride and they want a second credit card that has matching address, provided this unnecessary info and rejected because could not validate, your problem not mine. Dishonest, unreliable, do not use if your ride is a necessity. Unbelievable. 0 stars if I could"

            "I don't review apps, but this one's special. I didn't and don't know anything about editing videos, but this made it super simple to learn... Step by step instructions and a tonne of features even without the pro version. This and the GoPro video editing apps are the best I've found for mobile. Going to buy pro... I think they deserve the revenue. I'm using it a lot with zero issues... Very happy. Thank you very very muchüôè",
            "I really love this editor, it's simple enough to work with, and yet sophisticated enough to make awesome videos. Other editors have their watermark on the free version but this app doesn't and it's light enough for older phones to edit long full HD videos. It perfect for simple videos for YouTube/Facebook. Only thing missing is adding a fading effect at the end of the video, maybe it's only in the pro version? but it would be nice to have in the free version as well.. well deserved 5 stars..",
            "This is absolutely extraordinary. I have tried many other video-editing apps such as \"Kinemaster\" and \"VivaVideo\" but this is by far the best. The others contain alot of ads, glitches and are generally messed up. However this app has no video ads, (only small ones that are rare) it is very neat organised with the icons so that you can easily access and find your needed edit, I have been using it for a long time now and yet I have found no bugs or pay to win problems. I highly recommend this app.",
            "Great app but I already paid the one time fee and it just made me pay it again. When I tried to restore my premium it just kept giving me a fail error. I didn't even uninstall the app. Welp, now I realized I paid 12.99 for nothing because every time I open a photo or video I get an error message 4106 failed to open file?!? Now I can't even use this app.",
            "It's great. But sometimes It can be a pain to fix the mistake. But so far it has not done anything to me. Plus on top of that there is no watermark and you can fade the music in and out. Which would be perfect. Even though we may lost a few file.....it does not go well. Anyway I prefer this app to help me some few edit."

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "I understand that the refund is under process and will probably take 14 days to reflect into my account. I will wait for 14 days and check with the bank. However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important.

            "I absolutely LOVE this game. The only criticism is that some pieces dont fit into the puzzles and when it's part of a timed event, it can get a little frustrating. Otherwise, the puzzles are really fun and the graphics are pretty good. I really like the events, and find myself playing this game every day. If you like Puzz-3D you'll LOVE this game. I enjoy learning about all of the different places created, and that new places are a available every week. I hope it is supported for a long time.",
            "I wish there were more room to describe in painful detail how much this game relies on ads. I like ad-based games. Do NOT get me wrong. But when you need to play a 30sec ad to start AND finish a level and to move from screen to screen and to play in the timed events, it takes away from the greatness of the game. My major prob is with being given a choice: ad at the end of a lvl to get more coins or no ad for fewer coins. Easy, right? Except you get an ad either way. This app is dreadful.",
            "The puzzles are fun but the ads are pretty insufferable in the free version. Even when clicking on a puzzle without the ad sign next to it you will have to watch an ad. When closing a puzzle you will have to watch an ad. I'd give it 5 stars if only there were fewer or less irritating ads.",
            "I love this. I don't even care about the adds. I LOVE THIS !!!!! I just wish that I could update more often. Thats how much I play. It says \" bug fixed \". Sometimes it will say that it updated when it didn't. I do play it ALOT, PLEASE FIX THE UPDATE BUTTON. I am addictive to these puzzles. I also learn alot about the places that i did not know. Keep giving me more. CAN I GET AN UPDATE PLEASE DAMN.",
            "I love this game it is amazing how it challenges your brain to fix the puzzle. There is one problem though. The events are hard to do as the cost in game money. And to usually get that is to do puzzles or to get the amount to do the event is real life money. That is all that needs fixed don't make events to expensive. All in all great game."

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

            "I was working perfectly until yesterday. I opened it this morning to send some stuff but the message still isn't delivered. It doesn't work on both devices i used it on. I tried everything, deleting and reinstalling, updating, restarting my phone, logged out and in. Still doesn't work. My wifi is also perfectly fine with other apps and webs.",
            "This works ok. I been getting annoyed because I don't always get a notification that I got a message. For example ill randomly open it and than it will tell me I got a message a few hours back im like WTH it's supposed to tell me when I get it. You guys need to fix that issue it happens too often",
            "It works most of the time, what irritates me is the lack of fluidity of the performance given by the app when using it even on the highest-end devices. Other third-party apps on my phone works fine, smooth like butter except LINE, it stutters frequently without any explanations or whatsoever. I hope this can be fixed in the future. And I also hope that it will be more optimized for tablets because, I cant use the app on landscape mode except in chats....which is.... odd.",
            "Please fix the verification problem. When I log in on my laptop, the phone won't show box to put in the number. Used to work regularly until yesterday. Perhaps it's because I chance my email and it's a bug? QR code log in is fine but I don't like to do it every time I turn on my laptop. Please fix this and I will rate back to 5 stars. Thank you.",
            "The reason why i gv 3 stars,it becoz when we login in other device all chat disappear. Line gv an option to save the chat to google drive,unfortunately every time I try to sv in drive,its not works. Eventhough if it works sv in drive,still faces an isssue which is we cant open it,or its not appear directly like in other apps did. It would be great if Line can make all chat not dissapear,like messenger on FB did,which is the chat appear same like when the last time i see in other device. Thanks!"

            "Love the game. I'm only giving it a mid rating is because of the ads. Recently there is a repetitive ad for weight loss that looks sketchy, people talk but there's no dialogue, just an annoying soundtrack. There's no product name. I think it's a phishing scam. There used to be a small icon with an ! that gave you the option to hide an ad that was either repetitive or irrelevant, but that has disappeared. Instead now you have to actually close the app and restart it to get rid of the ad.",
            "The game is top notch! A couple of major detractors though. 1. Advertising is way out of hand. Most ads now require two dismissals before going away. The advertisers are also working very hard to disguise the dismissals for the sole reason of keeping their page up as long as possible. And, sorry Mobilityware, there are many instances in which the ad cannot be dismissed after 5 seconds, such as Disney and Purina. 2. The daily goals needs to have a 'turn-off' feature. The speed penalty is too hi",
            "I truly love playing this strategic game!!! It really makes you think outside the BOX!! Not only that, it relaxes your entire mind, body, and soul!! It's a comparative game; in which, it gives you a GREAT!! Brain- Work-out, knowing that you can actually select the RIGHT- COMBINATION OF MOVES and go from one level to the next. I relax with this strategic game daily. Carolyn Reese Atlanta, Georgia OCTOBER 14, 2020",
            "Like game not the ads. I have been playing for over a year. You needs the ads for revenue, I got that. However, pictures of a women's ass in tight clothes is not what I am looking for. If I wanted that I would go to a different site. So select less explicit ads or I go elsewhere. PS children play these games. So you are contributing to the delinquency of minors.",
            "Another great app ruined by ads and greed... I'd happily pay to remove the stupid ads but they're greedy, they want a subscription! üòÜ just charge a one time charge like everyone else. I'm not paying for a subscription that's just nuts.. I've been playing for years and now I'm leaving, plenty of other solitary apps. Also notice all the people complaining about the ads and the developers done NOTHING."

            "My favorite game, I literally deleted my other games because this is the only one I play now, I love it so much. Everything from how positive it is, to the perfectly fitting audio that plays. I love how simple and easy going this game is and I love how this games helps you succeed. The levels where you can locate items are super fun as well, recommending this game to everyone I know literally!!",
            "Caution. This game is really nicely crafted, very visually rich, and enjoyable to play from levels 1-10. After this, things start to go absolutely mental. There is pop-up after pop-up, harassing you about another new feature. You quickly get to a point where you're bamboozled - everything on the screen is shouting at you. This appears to be by design, hyper confusion and attention hijacking to nurture addiction. This app is nefarious and should be enjoyed only with huge restraint.",
            "Never log into Facebook. It causes you to lose the prizes from any contest you won. I had tons of things coming from a dots race and they vanished the second it connected to Facebook. Also, the game freezes and crashes a lot when watching videos to get a bonus box. You have to be patient when you open the app. It can take over five minutes to come up.",
            "Honestly was obsessed with this game for awhile, but they made a bunch of updates and now every time you view the map about four or five different windows pop up to tell you about the different games. It used to just be the daily bonus. Tired of exiting out of a bunch of stupid notifications just to be able to click on the game I want. They ruined a good thing.",
            "You get to a certain point and you can't win anything without spending money. With prices on everything else in life steadily increasing the last thing I wanna spend money on is a silly phone game. If you could just spend money once or twice, maybe no big deal. But you have to constantly spend money to get perks to help you thru the levels and clearly this is by design. It's a really cool game, and very disappointing to have to delete, but I'm just not up for money hungry games like this."

            "Updated 10/31/20: The app is totally unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but I can't hit a single button on it. Completely useless. Original Review: Used to work great, but lately it has all kinds of bugs whether it suddenly decides it won't accept my payment method anymore or errors out when I try to place an order. It freezes and often forgets to clear my order bag after I've successfully picked up an order. So many headaches lately, I don't know what went wrong. Ued to love this app.",
            "Constantly buggy and glitches. I've used it successfully but it typically requires constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app or religiously clearing your cache. The deals screen often says you've already used a deal and have to wait an hour even when you haven't ordered in weeks. Overall, a frustrating experience for something that should be a convenience.",
            "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
            "Fantastic app, works every time. Orders being automatically submitted and requiring \"reopening\" every time I switch apps is annoying but no big deal. One of the best developed fast food pre-order apps. The restaurants, maybe 1.5 star. They must be hiring illiterates, or they glance at the screen and throw in guesses for anything forgotten. The \"hot&spicy\" chicken patty isn't very spicy going down but DON'T LET IT BACK UP. Seems it turns into the fire of hades in your guts. Omg I cried, no joke.",
            "Well, a couple years later, new phone, different Android version, still freezing on the opening screen. so unreliable (CLEARING CACHE DOES NOTHING!) - your food isn't that great that your app should be so problematic. Business 101 - don't make it difficult for people to do business with you. BK works great EVERY time - BYE!"

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ‚ù§",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.üëçüëçüëç",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "challenging & interesting game. Certain levels are too challenging for the simple minded like me! Tempted to give up many times as it's too time consuming! üò¢Don't understand why the gold bars are not available for use even though the piggy bank has been full many times. Getting too difficult to complete a level, impossible in fact for hours on end. Very tempted to give up all together & try other games. Getting to a stage where it's too time consuming to complete a level. Losing interest.",
            "This game is fun sometimes, until you have one left and you lose. This game is rigged. Cause they can give you what you need if there is only one left, but they want you to spend money, and when you do spend a little money, you would expect to get cheaper prizes and better prizes. Y'all need to do something about it because im getting annoyed when that happens after I've spent $30 or $40, im expecting better results with my spending",
            "Been Playing for 10 years and I'm obsessed with this game. I love the animals and the challenges, I have gotten all of the animals in the game w/o really putting 5$ in and playing on/off for so many years. So Its a great game with great side games you can play for hours. To the Developers I would like to see more of the level streak boost. For every level you pass you get boosters on your next like the candy crush sagas have. Thank You if you made it here!",
            "Great game until you reach the pay wall level. Move the sheep to the hay.. yeah when the game decides that you're allowed to. No information provided on how to move the sheep, thought I'd got the last sheep to the hay with my last move but NOOOO.. game decides that the same move I'd made with the previous sheep was not allowed. 100% designed like this so you spend money. Well not me. Deleted. As with candy crush take your game and SHOVE IT!!!!",
            "fun till it started cheatingüò°When it starts cheating again I will uninstall it again. It is ok for awhile then it cheats. Funny that the cheating starts when a player reaches higher levels. I am not going to pay for gold bars I have \"WON.\" A lot of time is wasted on ads and other nonsense. I spend mote time watching dumb ads than playing...boo!"

            "This app used to be good. I tried to add another bank account to use to send money and it did not accept my amount to verified. I never had problems sending money before. Then I tried the original bank account to send money. It keep saying cannot process try later. It's been three days and still now working. What a shame. I loved this app before, now I dont. Have to find another way to send money.",
            "There isno feedback on payments and I had to exit and re-open the app to see my payment was sent. The settings suck, if something is on and you want it off, the app starts linking your accounts instead of being an off or on option. Whatever you do, don't accidentally break their rules or they will ban you for life and not give you an appeal option. The parent company will persecute you of you treat anyone the way they treat their customers.",
            "I have had venmo since they started. I have not had any issues, I use it to accept payments. It makes budgeting easier for me as I use my venmo to make misc purchases that I don't want to use for my main account. No issues for me ever. I found venmo because originally I was with cash app. Someone hacked my acct and cash app penalized me and closed my account with no option to open again. Venmo saved the day! i love this app, my favorite part is the emojis!",
            "App keeps freezing and crashing out of nowhere. It still runs fine, but at least 2 or 3 times now I've sent money to someone and the app freezes while the money is sending. Only way to escape is by exiting the app through task manager. The money always goes through to the other person but this shouldn't happen. Also often the app will just freeze while I'm scrolling through transactions. Sometimes it resolves itself, sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise, I would rate this app 5 stars.",
            "The app keeps freezing randomly all the time, while navigating through it. It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it could be scrolling, tapping on something, etc., I have to restart the app each time. I also don't get notifications until I manually open the app. After which I keep getting the same notification again after I've closed the app!"

            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. üëé",

They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue.

            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",

            "I got so many memories in this. Before my mother had new phone in 2020. Go back to 2019 or 2018 I do not remember. At that time Iwas going to play Exploration Lite, then (Because I was a kid and this was new for me) when I opened Exploration Lite, it's Kiloblocks Lite and I am scared becsuse it is not Exploration Lite anymore. Then I played dis and it is so fun. I like this and played, so many new blocks and dis game does know what it needs and not. I build so many. Thank you forso many memories",
            "Alright, I'm rating this 5 stars for giving me so many memories. I remember asking for my moms phone to play \"Exploration Lite\". If you didn't, this game used to be called that. But I remember different terrain and more blocks to use. I don't really know why they removed these features. It made the game fun when you don't have the real Minecraft. But seriously, this game has given me so much nostalgia just by playing it. Thank you for the fun memories.",
            "I love this game! It does need to update it. There should be a save button. I should not worry about closing the tab by accident and my build being gone. They also need to have more inventory to build with. This game would also be really fun if you could play with others, for example put in a code and your friend could join.. Overall it is a good game but PLEASE ADD A SAVE BUTTON AND A FRIENDS MODE!",
            "The game brings back memories back when this game was called Exploration Lite. I remember the time I made a big square house and then I pressed recent tab and all my progress was gone lol. I loved this game... Still do. This was when Google Play was called Play Store - The good times. I had a lot of games - Moshi monsters, glow hockey, Temple Run 1, 2 and every OG game. Now Google Play is riddled with good games that are ruined because of in-game ads and marketing ads. (99% fail etc)",
            "When I was scrolling down my library page on my phone I found this and just gave me a wave of nostalgia this was the Minecraft when you can't afford it I remember building a wal mart and it was so satisfying when I completed it but it didn't have a save feature so it didn't last for very long anyways it was a good game."

Whatever \"improvements\" have been made to this app have been horrible, & have made it much slower & much worse than it used to be.

It's annoying to have to constantly adjust the volume level for every video and ad! This app has been getting worse with every update!! The other weather apps are much better and more detailed. Sorry Weather Channel but I think I will be uninstalling your app now and I don't recommend it to anyone.",
            "Wish I had never updated this app. My old weather channel app was so much better. Every time I try to shrink the map, there's very little to no response. I have to tap the screen and then try to shrink the map so I can see a broader View, but almost every time I do that, the app has to restart. The old map showing national weather would respond very well to the touch of my fingers. Not so anymore."

            "I hate that ads are automatically placed at the top of my email every time I open the app. Then, when Im scrolling down through my emails, there is this wierd break in the list to show me yet another advertisement in the background. Also, deleting large amounts of email is tedious and takes forever. Half the time, it crashes before deleting anything. That being said, apart from the advertising forced on me, the app looks good and I like that I can change to color of the bar at the top.",
            "This app is harder to use after I updated. The files no longer display a constant subfolder. I have to select from the main folder every time. Also, it takes longer to move from one folder to another. It still has the issue of not allowing me to move a subfolder, so I have to create a new subfolder, move contents from one to another, then delete the old one. The improvements have not improved it. I am a bit sorry I updated.",
            "Really bummed after recent updates. Before, when you wanted to move a number of emails to the same folder and opened up the folders list, it displayed the folder you were using. Now, whenever you open the folders list, you're at the beginning of the list and the first folder. So each time you have to repeatedly scroll to the proper folder. I also don't like the links to similar emails that appear at the top of each email. You have to scroll down to see the email message. Put em at the bottom.",
            "What's happened with this app? It constantly freezes up. I have to keep closing and opening it in an attempt to read my mail. I've used this app for a long time with no problems but lately it is just a horrible experience. I am using a Samsung S2 tablet. I've had similar problems on my S9 phone. My Internet is fine. I have no issues with anything else. What's up?",
            "Nothing but problems since having to reload app on the 20th of October. Been a loyal subscriber for 20 years, but will change if improvement isnt seen in the next day or so. App is taking forever to update and replicate on Samsung S2 Tablet. Never had this issue on the 'old' application. The S20 phone doesn't seem to have a problem other than continually trying to load. It's is not a network or wifi issue."

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do soüòâ)."

I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over ¬£200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

We update every week, so keep checking this space for new features and other nifty stuff. <br>  <br>New and Not-so Noticeable:  <br>- Many bug fixes, plus performance and stability improvements. ",
        "comments": [
            "Ever since the update it made it worse. It rings again, that's good. Problem is, people can't hear me but I can hear them. I have to use LINE for the time being until it gets fixed. Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. üëç",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

Have been playing for a long time! I've made it past over 300 levels but this entire time it's kind of been a lackluster game compared to some of 'your' others",
            "Its always challenging to figure out how to defeat a level. The only levels I really dont enjoy are the ones where there are chains over the buckets and you have to hit a matching color \"face\" thing to open it and the \"face\" changes color and changes which bucket it opens.That one is too confusing trying to figure out the pattern without wasting pears to shoot.",
            "Simple and fun,but there are some REALLY hard levels that can take even days to beat,such a simple and long game shouldn't have such hard levels. There should be an option to skip levels for free if,for example,you fail to beat it in 10 - 15 lives or maybe even less.",
            "I click the little circle on the top right corner and it says to put my fb information and when I do , says invalid token access .. what does that mean? why can't I see which level my friends are on ? Please fix",
            "It's an entertaining and addictive game, but it has some major cons. You only get 5 lives and you have to wait a certain amount of time before they regenerate, even though this game is clearly designed to make you constantly fail and replay levels. 5 lives is not enough, a game like this shouldn't even be using the \"lives\" format, it just ruins the experience and makes me stop playing since I have no more lives. This game is all about luck, not skill, which is extremely annoying and lazy."

            "I have used the app with the same bank and information for over a year only changing my phone number. Initially I had no issues. Three last the months however, I haven't been able to use the app for anything as it can't seem to verify my information. I am unable to receive payments, send payments, add money or cash out money that's in my cash app account. I've reached out to support numerous times with no response. I love there convenience of the app and the boosts I was getting but not anymore.",
            "I hate this app! It's useless. Can't do anything like you're suppose to be able to. Linking cards and accounts never works like it should or even like it did one time before. I had to replace my card, same card and company just a new numbers but it won't link the new information?! The card is allowed and supported but now I can't load money. Hate using this app unless it's completely my last resort!",
            "This app is a scam to me now unlike before that it's working well. When you download it it will be asking for your SSN. Its really frustrating. Some guys are patronizing themselves as customer care representatives all they do is hack your bank accounts and all your hard earned money is gone. The money sent to me can't be accessed too for the past 2 weeks. I don't encourage anyone to download this app",
            "Cashapp is GREAT! That is, until you have ANY problem with your account! Support is useless! I've sent FIFTEEN (15) emails in the last 2 days because I had to order a new card and I've been sent TWO (2) that don't match the new card info on my account, with only 2 responses, neither of which got the problem fixed, and nothing further from them. CASHAPP DOES NOT HAVE RELIABLE SUPPORT. IF YOU NEED TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE, I WILL APPLY FOR THE JOB AND SHOW YOU HOW TO MANAGE A BUSINESS AND KEEP FANS!",
            "This app is horrible in scanning id. There is no button to use when taking a picture of front and back of id. The front i had to click on flash sign, the back side i had to close app and reopen to even see a flash sign and then when i clicked for back side, the functions changed ot just lit up id. The app took a picture on its own of back side as i was moving my id arpund for 30 min annoyed. And then it only took when i put super close, taking only an 8th of whole back side, twice!"

            "This app seems to be littered with dozens, if not, hundreds of ads that have been up for, in some cases, over 2 years. I sent one a message asking if it was available, and didn't receive a reply. After seeing that the ad was still posted, I also noticed that it was posted 2 years ago. I saw a few other listings that had the same story. I liked how LetGo didn't leave listings over a couple months old without asking the lister if it was still relevant.",
            "This app is far less usable than Letgo was. The second I click on one thing to see what it is, I am immediately bombarded with listings of similar items from ebay. If I wanted to look on ebay, I would use that app. Don't assume I need to see 20 of that item. Prices aren't listed in the browse page so I have to click to find them. And when something sells, it doesn't disappear. It just stays with the other listings and says \"Sold\". I dont need to see all the things I cannot buy.",
            "Over 70% of the messages you will get will be fraudulent scams (they are quite obvious, but it's annoying to deal with). There is not much support for when you have issues with the app and I kept getting my posts removed for items being \"intangible\", which was not true, had photos and descriptions of actual items and there was nothing I could do about it, so it just became pointless and frustrating to use. Stick with FB marketplace or CL or other platforms",
            "Titles, descriptions, and prices of items are not shown in search results, leading me to click a bunch of images only to see that the item is not what I want or out of my price range. PLEASE add titles and prices to search results page. Also the gallery of pictures that are not in any order or in one grid make it confusing to look through listings. I don't get what the intent is... To have me looking through the app forever and never finding what I am looking to buy???? Please fix the UX.",
            "The app already sucked, but now it's worse. Why would you combine 2 apps and not take the good from the other app? To many old listings, nothing expires. Messaging is a joke, you're better off talking to the wall. An speaking of messages, how can I sell something if I dont get notified? To many times I've had to open the app just to see multiple messages, days old, and the buyer long gone, thanks offer up. I remember when this app came out, that was its prime, now it's just garbage."

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. üòÄ",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ‚ù§"

            "Love the game. 30 sec ads after each and every single play is frustrating. Found a way around it. Use it every time. Terminate the game as soon as the ad starts. Starting the game back up only takes 16 seconds! Many games are 15 seconds. Wish the newest similar game was not a constant ad at the top of the list of opponents to play. Tried the new one, did not like it at all! Maybe it is good for the new generations. Came back to this original version even though all kinds of stuff added.",
            "Full page ad after every single move. Every.single.move. Also, there is nothing to keep the screen from going dark during gameplay. You have to manually set it yourself and then reset it when you are done. Also, person with most points doesn't win, so I don't see the need for points at all. First person out of letters wins. So it's really just a game of who can use all their letters first.",
            "Used to be fun and my favorite time passer. Now it's just so overwhelming buggy and full of ads. The developers obviously care nothing about the game play and have become nothing more than money grabbers. I know it's stupid but my own protest is to specifically go out of my way to never buy anything I see in one of these ads here.",
            "The ads freeze so the game must be closed and reopened. This happens after every turn and your version of ad-free is a $10/mo subscription? If there's a cheap, one-time, ad-free purchase....I'm not seeing it. Fix this please. I'd be more than willing to pay a very small one-time fee to just remove ads.",
            "I cannot view the ads to gain more coins, BUT am over run with ads after each move. Some dont finish, so close game. Have repeatedly complained to no effect. Will not buy coins for power ups! People complain about creeps lurking - don't answer them, then when finished game, block them. Turn volume off to block loud music or noise."

I keep force stopping and deleting the cache but these messages don't load for hours. I don't use the standard call-in voicemail and haven't had a password set up for years. Really frustrating because obviously voicemails tend to be time-sensitive.",

That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",

Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",

I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it.

Build, expand, plan your strategy -- the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don't stop there! Recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny peaceful town to a big bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don't forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (there's something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top of the tourist destinations list.\r\n\r\nMeet Your New Family\r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice!

            "*TOO MUCH ADS ON GAMEPLAY* I was playing around 1 hour and game showed mo than 10 ads, it was displayed on banners when you tap on a factory or a store, ad videos showed every 3 minutes and makes this game unplayable. I didn't like this game, i thought it will be a nice game, but no, it doesn't. Guys don't download the app, it's just a waste of time. Sometimes, graphics quality get down, and i don't know why.",
            "Fun game but some items are quite expensive (especially Bizzies). I've been trying to save up enough game bucks to get certain ones, too, but unfortunately have lost a few hundred due to accidentally tapping on a button which causes instant production a number of times. There should be a warning asking to confirm when you're about to spend a lot of bucks. I'd be willing to spend some actual money in this game if things weren't so ridiculously overpriced. $100 for a robot Bizzie? Ha!",
            "Great game, but how I wish the creator make this offline after downloading 300 plus mb in the game, the 300mb is enough to sustain the game but making it online after that will increase the the use of data . And also the game is so aggressive in some minor internet problem, that's why really I recommend to just make the game offline after downloading the resource.",
            "This game is absolutely incredible..the graphics are awesome and the ameplay is amazing! The only bad thing is you need SOO much money to actual buy a new person in your city and I don't really have digital money because I'm 12 and I know you guys are trying to profit off this game..but please make it easier to get new people",
            "I love this pixlated city building game. But this game needs a airport, cargo ship port and the futuristic building like omega build. Also what would be good is to have upgradable streets. City mania is the best city building game that I play. City mania would be amazing if these thing would be added to this game. Thanks."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

I use this for music, capturing dreams when I wake up, recording important conversations, and sorting out ideas. I've downloaded this on multiple phones, I just wish there was an apple version of it.",
            "It's Great! Does what it says it'll do and so far and especially with as much as I use it, no crashes, glitches or stall outs, (which used to happen a couple of years ago with older version of both app and phone). I've always re-downloaded this app specifically because of its definitive reliability for all that I need it for. It's also a definite 'must have' for interviews, appointments, sessions, and lectures whenever needed. (Only thing I might ask is for more updates playback options) Thanks",
            "Great, simple app that opens quickly, is easy to navigate, and does exactly what it proposes to do and nothing more. When a native recorder was added to Android recently I considered switching to it, but it has a fatal flaw: it's difficult to get your recordings out of it. This app records things to a well-known place that it shows you via its settings.",
            "I've been using this app for a few years now to record song ideas and stuff and they finally asked me to rate it so I decided hell yeah why not this app is a free high-quality recorder and has helped me out immensely and they don't constantly bombard with ads and and ask you to rate all the time I noticed this was the first time they asked maybe they just do that now but anyway I said \"let's do it.\" Hope u like that sentence. üòé This is my primary recording app and I prefer it over the others.",
            "Why all the high ratings for this I just ran the app and tested the recording quality of talking with my phone locked and my phone was directly next to me and all I got was muffled inaudible garbage. Perhaps it is good for speaking directly into the mic recording but if you need to record a class or something with your phone closed it seems this isn't the app for it. I had high hopes for this app back to the drawing board."

Thinking it was an issue with my phone I uninstalled and reinstalled apps, lost all my boosters, silver coins etc the only thing that saved was the level I was at. Instead of being a relaxing game it's now really frustrating to play.",

If my booster is able to be used you cannot bc it kicks you out of the game. Why do you have us fill the piggy bank and then want us to pay for get the gold bars? They should be free. Why is there no way to win tickets to the circus? This game needs to be tweaked a lil bit and the cheating should stop. Just my opinion though.",

I have played it on several devices since 2013.. at first the game was fun & enjoyable...how ever over the past 18 months..it has Had sooooo! Many flaws...cheats...unresponsive ! constantly lags.

            "A safe option for rides at reasonable prices. The problem is that it has difficulties finding user's location, which means you have to wait longer until the app finds you, and it won't let you choose your address manually as in other similar apps or simply write it. I haven't been able to use it lately, because it doesn't find my location and while waiting for it, it uses a lot of your data. Please fix it!",
            "The app is safe and great most of the times. But sometimes, in the peak hours, looks like the app assign a service without the authorization of the car driver, when I had called those call drivers to ask why are they moving in other direction, they said they didn't accepted the service and the app assigned it. This makes the person to lose time waiting for a car that is not going to arrive.",
            "I tried to use the app to get a ride home on New Year's Eve and it kept on closing on me. Now I'm trying to change to a new credit card but no matter what I do it won't let me confirm the new card. Prior to this it worked fine, but not much use now if I can't even get the app to work."

            "I love this game! They send free credits throughout the day. Of course using premium level and 4 cards is the best. But I've gotten bingos off of one card. Really have to try this one ü•∞ 10/29/29 Grumpy Cat is the best ever room. You definintly have to try it. Win clothing items, dress him up, take pics I share them in my FB story. GRUMPY always makes me smile. Seriously give him a try you'll be glad you did!!",
            "I loved this game, play it everyday sometimes 2 or 3 times but after the update its always crashing on me. I had over 100 chips this morning and every game I tried to play it let me buy the game, start playing then freeze until it comes up game over. Im not playing again till this is fixed - a shame as it would have been a 5 star review last week ‚òπ",
            "Wonderful game. Tired of having credits taken away every single day lately without the benefit of actually getting to play. Frustrated! Looking for new favorite game if support can't fix this issue. ü§¨ I reach out to support and all I get is information on how the game works. No refund whatsoever on my credits. What a joke.",
            "Great game for bingo lovers, I play every morning with my cup of coffee and some Bingo Bash, love the game but getting annoyed with the gifts every night it comes thru get your gift and you hit the icon and no free surprise its been going on for weeks now, i play every day and do spend a good bit of money on chips, please tske a look or fix or I'll have to lower from 5 stars, i do love the game but very annoying",
            "I find it boring now. I love playing mini games as Rapid bingo or Grand tour. I always loose all my chips in rapid bingo. Very few times I won otherwise always loose chips.From last 6 months playing Grand tour but not won 300 chips reward. So stop playing that also. I find your team is only interested who put money. Those who play with free chips, your team don't bother. Now I feel depressed while playing this game, while loosing the chips. Earlier this game was my favorite."

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

Is there anyway to clear the numbers in the activity sectipn? I have a list that goes back over 8/9 months. I use it often however still have the same problem with the ph. nbrs. Is there a way to delete some of the old nbrs?",

The game sucks U should have a 2builders from the start and the limit of 5builders, And have a competetive fight only your level can fight you, because i play it then i challenge some raids, after it resets there is a 1.5m powered guy And I only have 200k power, how am i supossed to beat that?!",

Can still progress f2p but really slowly. My game experience is hindered by long loading times and lag, didn't matter if I used my phone or gaming rig with bluestacks was still slow. Takes forever to load in and any pvp. Frequently, my commands aren't even done due to lag."

            "This game is a random game, I like it for the fact that it makes you think but as an offset it drops stuff you can not think about. If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Used Groupon at launch, when it was actually a bargain site. Nowadays I hardly use it. If you search for goods on eBay/Amazon, 9/10 times they'll be ¬£3-4 cheaper. I only use the app. Was offered 20% off next order, no code, link, or details. Pressed accept and it said it would be applied at checkout, it wasn't. Spoke to four agents on chat, all copy/paste template replies. When I started complaining, all four pretended they couldn't see my replies and that I'd gone idle and disconnected me.",
            "I absolutely LOVE GROUPON! It is the only app I use for my great deals! I get on there atleast 3 times a day sometimes more! The notifications are awesome! && I love how is a variety of things. The up to 97% off some things blows my mind! Such great deals. If you don't have this app its an amazing app and a great way to save money",
            "There should not be this many daily notifications for the little amount of content on this app. The search is garbage. It routinely shows \"deals\" in my area, amd o then find out my area is apparently two states away. Very few business use this anymore. While these are strange times, this was still the case last year. No worthwhile deals. All the goods sold herr are also pretty garbage deals. They can regularly be had on amazon on elsewhere for the same price as their sale price on groupon.",
            "Total waste of time. First, there were not many deals in my area. Then when we traveled with it, there was not much savings. Then it started charging my card when I did not authorize the charge for a \"groupon select\" there is no customer service to call, only email and online chats. I contacted them for the last year telling them to unsubscribe me, each time I was told it went thru. Is an act of God to get them to answer email or the online chats. They are like a bad case of the herpes.",
            "Some good deals, but not all what they seem and customer service is a joke. I paid $21 for 3 days of airport parking and was charged another $40 when I left. According to the Groupon, regular price would've been $30, so I paid twice as much as I would have without the \"deal\". I tried to chat with customer service twice and got no help, then disconnected in less than 1 min while I was typing a short reply, clearly because they didn't want to be bothered, and this is just one example of MANY."

            "Really disappointed, I used to use this all the time driving but recently it has stopped working properly. The route line marker would have odd gaps. Only the parts of the map that was previously loaded would appear. Locations that were never encountered prevously would not load map data, so I'd be driving on a regional highway and suddenly loose the map with no idea where to stop and change to google maps. I thought reinstalling the app would fix my problems but now there is no map at all.",
            "Why does after the recent updates..Gps is always difficult to detect? Always took very long to show the navigation route. After many times force close the app..then only will the navigation route line appear. Works so fine in the past..just open the app..enter the address..navigation route appears..then off u go. Now..so frustrating. Is it bug or something? Pls do something to make it as effective and effecient as before.",
            "This used to be my go to app for driving but it stopped working properly a few months back. I keep checking in on it to see if things have changed and they haven't. Uninstalled and reinstalled, still not working correctly. It shows me driving down the road sideways and the map glitches.",
            "Love this app. It's fairly easy to use and once your whole route is loaded In you can turn off data to save it and save battery. If I had one complaint that it would be it runs in the background when your done using it, if there is a way to turn this off please let me know.",
            "I was going to give this app three stars because it is better than google maps but I have to type while I drive every time it forces me to use Google Voice recognition Instead of their own voice recognition, but now I can only give it one star because it decided to get in my face about voting; something that has nothing to do with navigation."

            "My experience has been awful. After the 1 month free premium trial I tried to cancel my subscription it would not let me. Day 6 of trying to get a refund, countless hours spent on the 'live chat' feature which kicks you off every 3 minutes. Emailed them with link below. Haven't heard anything yet. This is incredibky disappointing and shows that I cannot support this company with my money as it seems impossible to speak to someone or get an issue resolved. Utterly disappointing customer service.",
            "For a professional tool, there are way too many bugs. For instance, when someone sends us a connection request, we can't click to see their picture. It simply doesn't open. Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

The app usually says my email is not registered with the app. When I attempt to \"register\" the the app says the email already exists. I dont understand what is going on. Even with trying to get through to the help centre I have to \"log in\" but I cant coz I keep being kicked out",

That notification bar is a nuisance, I have turned it off 10times and it keeps coming back. the notifications bar just doesn't stay hidden it just keeps taking up real estate on my screen for nothing. How do you delete your account?",
            "Ok this is my example of how things work they post an add off an amplifier pricing it from 100-1000 ! But whenever you try to buy ! Its always $1,000 most sellers lie on the add and some are rude after you question the ! Plus app doesnt work ! I cant open it keeps telling me to go to a desktop ! Useless app.",
            "I am do tired of uninstalling this app (6 times so far this week), it is worse than a virus. I never asked for it, dont want it and cant apparently get rid of it. So my advice - avoid it like the plague. If I could find a good way tp complain about this unwanted invasion of my phone I would. Another 2 uninstalls later. Google should ban this app.",
            "Messenger doesn't work after the last update, keeps giving \"sign in failed\" error. I have to use my laptop browser to access the website instead, which is frustrating. 29/10/2020 we are back to the \"sign in failed\" issue again. Works ok on browser but app is still having problems."

            "Really good game, I been playing it for two days already and I love it. But something happened: it lagged in my home and it's seems I can't move. The screen moves, I can craft and destroy blocks but I can't move. I made a new world and it works just fine, I'm kind of sad that I'm losing everything from the first one, since I made a lot of progress and I had a lot of things. I will try to play again in the new world but if the problem happens again I will rate it lower",
            "I FOUND THE GAME FINALLY. This game was my whole childhood. When I couldn't afford Minecraft, I would play this, and I remember spending hours building things. If for some reason you can't spare 10 bucks to get Minecraft, this is definitely one of the better rip-offs out there. If I could recommend one thing however, maybe implement a feature that would allow you to transfer worlds? I would be very curious as to what the world I spent hours making looks like.",
            "Very good game, good graphics. D game is cool cuz u can go to other dimension its so cool like this is d best game ever. But am rating it a 4 star bcuz in other mine crafts u can fly but this one u can't fix that and also make a setting to on/off d zombies and creepy things so u won't be scared when playing. If ur reading this download d game cuz its cool download u won't regret it.",
            "Excellent Game . But there are some problems- 1. The blocks are disappearing whenever i am visiting the snow fields 2. Today i have brought a empty milk bottle from the shop at day and went to get some milk from cow , but after going a distance from my house the game had automatically cutted ‚ùåüö™ when i again start the game it is night ,I was in my house and there is no bottle with me ! Please let me know why it is happeningüôèüôè",
            "Old Minecraft gamer- Needs auto filling in the chests so you don't get left with 5 things that can go in one stack, the bow is pretty useless even if you get amethyst bow... It doesn't shoot far enough and takes too long/awkward to draw. Other than that it's pretty awesome, although a world map would be very very useful along with having the compass."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

Otherwise it has been great, I'm really enjoying the app! Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",
            "The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great. Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
            "Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days.",
            "I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

            "Great game but guild chat is lacking and not linear. It should be obvious and on top of that, the game does not support landscape view, which is a bummer. I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",

The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend ¬£95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend ¬£95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . üëç",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

            "Used to really love this game! Animals are so cute! I cant log in to my original game since it freezes up. It made me start from beginning and now the only game it lets me log in to is the one where it started me back at the beginning to level 4. I was at level 12 or higher with Facebook login and that game is completely gone! My original account login is with a different email. So i decided to install with this account but still freezes up! Really disappointed! Uninstalling again!",
            "I loved this game until I tried connecting to Facebook. This is the 2nd game from a different company I tried connecting to Facebook and have been unable to play ever since. I can't disconnect the app from Facebook now because the game tries to bring up the screen that says \"continue with so and so\" and then it goes away and then it comes back up and so on and doesn't give me enough time to hit the x to cancel it. I'd give it 5 stars if it worked properly.",
            "So far so good. I like the game very much; so far no real money spent(I appreciate that). I do like it enough to spend a little bit of money on it. Some production times are a bit too long, but you, can purchase those things in the market. I really enjoy this game it's relaxing. Good job Gameloft",
            "I think its a good game but when I try the login feature for Facebook, it shows the logging into facebook screen and keeps and disappearing. That is the only issue",

            "For being one of the largest television providers, your app is hot garbage. Not easy to navigate or find what you're looking for. But the DVR functionality is the worst. The whole point of the app is to be able to watch what I pay for on the go, and be able to access my DVR. The app syncs to my box but as soon as I leave my wifi I can no longer access my DVR shows. Fix this immediately!",
            "1. Difficulty logging on! 2. While watching a TV program. A commercial comes on. After the commercial the program puts me back to the beginning of the show. Then you have to toggle and try to find where you were. If you don't hit the right spot you go to another commercial and you have to wait again or go back to the beginning of the program. 3. The toggle to forward or reverse your position in a TV show is very sensitive and hard to use. I'm very surprised at DirecTV with such a sloppy program.",
            "Absolutely the worst app ever. Every show I try to watch restarts from the beginning after the first set on endless commercials. When I try to return to where I left off, the app either freezes, starts fast forwarding, plays picture with no sound, or sound with no picture. Rediculous! And I'm only giving 1 star because you're forcing me to before letting me post.",
            "I suppose it works to watch stuff On Demand if you missed something yesterday, same thing you can do on a computer. But, I don't comprehend how this app, for years, still has some sort of problem when watching your own DVR. It fails all the time. Today, I download an episode of a show. It finishes within 10 minutes. I open up my Downloads, it's not there. I download it again, the 10 minutes pass, again, and then it's finally marked as downloaded and ready. And yet. I click play, and it crashes.",
            "Does a lot of buffering even when connected to wifi. Drives me nuts that it doesn't keep track of where I am in previously watched shows. Then if I try to skip forward to find where I left off, I have to sit through 3 mins of commercials. No matter if I skip forward 20 mins or 2 mins. Again, this could be avoided if the app did a better job of tracking previously watched shows."

However, it irritates the friggin piss outta me that even though the app has been around for years and they're mostly known for their TV shows, they still don't have a Skip Intro option! If I'm binge watching a show, I don't wanna have to watch the intro every single freakin time! Disney+ has it and they haven't even been out for a year yet! Like why hasn't that been added yet!?",
            "Commercials commercialscommercials Maybe it is deliberate to drive you to buy the ad-free option. It just makes me despise Hulu. It makes even Netflix seem like a good app. If you want to rewind, it triggers commercials. Fast-forward? Commercials. Not infrequently, you get to see the same set of commercials. Sometimes, you get to watch them three times in a row. Over and over and over. Yay. (It's maddening.) And avoidable. And inept programming.",
            "I've never had an issue with this program in all the years I've used it, however, NOW I DO and I need to uninstall and reinstall, but there is NO way that I found to do that, yet.... What a serious pain and it shouldn't be. This is my home computer, and this shouldn't be a national secret how to do this! I'm soooo damn annoyed. The program loads just fine, but soon as I click a play arrow it freezes everything. I looked at the tools/inspect page, it clear shows the play path has been altered somehow. I don't do computer coding or maybe I could fix this myself, but it should be a simple fix to uninstall and reinstall like you would on your phone. I'm 65 years old, I am running Windows 7 because I like it. This really shouldn't be happening.",

It would be nice to adjust settings so it continued to play while my phone is locked or if I go to another app. Like I do with audiobooks. And when I put my unlocked phone in my pocket with the app running, it always seems to bounce to another show on my \"next up\" list before the show I am interested ends.",
            "I love Hulu I will always have it on my phone! I usually never have a problem and if i do, the app some how fixes its self. If i disconnect i just reload and its fixed. I have never had a issue that prevented me from watching my favorite adult cartoons. The price is good the content is awesome! I can always find something to watch for what ever situation. Hulu is doing everything right in my book!"

            "I have started to use the application in 2009. Then I liked it. In addition to this, I've decided to purchase for premium, created another account and shared my notebooks with my premium account. Then I couldn't see my shared notebooks on the web and mobile. I've been struggling with technical support for 2 weeks. They have promised for full technical support, I'm writing but they haven't returned for 5 days. Unfortunately, I'm switching back to Microsoft Onenote.",
            "After the major update to the app, the note texts are not readable anymore. Looks like Evernote messed up the text color setting in Android. My noted works fine in iPad and on PC. I always leave the text color as default and never changed it. However, in Android, text is in dark grey in Dark Mode, and light grey in Light mode. So the text color is always very close to the background color no matter which mode I choose. And this MAJOR issue has been there for at least a week!",
            "Ruined after the recent upgrade roll out: 1) Notes take ages to load up. 2) All the fonts which used to be available have now disappeared and all my notes are suddently in Sans Serif. At least it wasn't Comic Sans. 3) None of the desktop keyboard shortcuts I used to use which made this app efficient to use have disappeared. 4) It needs to be online to work - unnecessary and annoying Probably other things have gone wrong - it's only been a few hours since the upgrade. It wasn't broken - why try to fix it?? I've been a Premium subscriber for years - now considering cancelling & switching.",
            "I used to love this app and I use it a lot for work and personal info organisation. The latest update is an utter disaster for me. It requires a constant internet connection, which I - and millions of other people on this planet - don't have. I used to be able to work on notes whether I was online or offline - a helpful little red exclamation symbol would appear on the sync item when the app couldn't sync because the internet was down, so I would be careful not to change to working on the same note on a different device. Now the app insists on me reloading the note when the internet is down and wipes out my latest edits. This is useless! I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online. If this continues to be a problem I will, finally, have to relinquish my subscription and migrate to a different tool. (NB the Windows 10 app update doesn't even appear to have the option to change the sync setting at all - in fact the settings menu seems to have disappeared completely!!!)",
            "After the recent update, I've lost all my notes from the past 1 week simply because they had not automatically synced. The update was automatic btw. Pathetic experience, and quite stressful too. I was thinking of upgrading to premium but will definitely not do it now, after realizing my content can be deleted anytime without a fair warning."

When trying to register a new account it says \"Network Error: Check your network connection and try again.\" There is nothing wrong with my network connection. I've tried from my cell connection, home WiFi and Starbucks WiFi and receive the same message with each. Going to the developer's website is not helpful either (and it is very unprofessional looking).",
            "This app is supposed to be useful to make video calls for group chats, but it won't let me log back in, even if I put in the correct username and password! Also, when I try to sign in by using my Google account, and reset my password, it says to check my network connection and try again, even though it's really strong. It's not the network connection, it's the app not paying attention to it! You need to fix this immediately, or I will not install it again.",

            "Edit: After contacting support my problem was solved. Thank you, McAfee I paid $30 as a special fee for samsung users only to find out that my subscription is a trial. Then I had to subsribe for $14/monthly to upgrade it to standard membership. Would have been cheaper and easier if I had just purchased total protection from the website. I hope unlimited number of device protection is still available",
            "I'd give them ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê because the app itself generally works fine! But... there is a failure that irritates me a lot..! The MS App lock feature..! I understand that applications should be locked, if I want them to be locked. But come on... it is a bit too pesky when you have to unlock them every single time, over and over, even if they were minimised. Please, add a feature/possibility to make some apps stay unlocked in session. Thank you.",
            "I've tried the rest so I can say with experience that this is the BEST mobile security app on Google Play Store! Unlike the other apps their malicious website detection is superb. It actually detects suspicious sites before your browser can visit them & blocks you from even going there. Competitor's apps only detected 50% of malicious sites. VPN feature needs improved security & IP masking because the Plus hefty fee increase doesn't justify it.",
            "Can't access mcafee account after updating app and had no help from developer, except got redirected back to the app after which my code was regiven, only to be told by the app it wasn't valid and I payed for a year to be able to use the full app service, no other option to renew for another year was given either, what is the developer doing, give me the run around, so I give 1 star until problem is resolved. Thanks.",
            "This app is amazing. I brought a new laptop and I got a McAfee Multi Device Subscription for up to 3 devices. I loved this app because of its simple interface, real-time scanning and anti-theft. I can also backup my contacts and media in it. It improves my machine performance and provided me high security.

            "I love a quick game when I have a minute but lots of the newer ads force you to wait for 30 seconds or longer and when you try to close using the X it opens up the google play website. Not just once, but over and over again. Especially bad with 'playable' ads. I sometimes don't even bother waiting to play the game and choose another app. I can't click on your link from here, but I'm using Android 6.0.1 on an Asus tablet, if that helps.",
            "Love love love this particular Spider Solitaire! I got to the point where I had to delete the app because I was playing it too much! The ads are fun, relative and short. Not very invasive. Gives you the option to delete ads and start the game or keep watching and play when done. Fun little goals to achieve within the app, as well. This is THE BEST. I'm sad I have to stay all over cuz I was like almost a year's worth of medals and trophies etc.. Haha. Thanks",
            "Great but you've started to have ads that play sound even though my phone is on silent with media sounds off. This really should not be allowed. I can't play a game that does this as it annoys people around me. I should not have to use earbuds to avoid that. It's my phone and I choose, silence. If this continues then I delete this game.",
            "When I first downloaded this game , over a year ago, I really liked it. I enjoyed playing the daily challenge and earning a jeweled crown. My crowns started disappearing overnight. I've contacted support several times , but they couldn't tell me why this happens. They gave me some crowns back, but that's beside the point. It continues to happen. I've even uninstalled the app completely, turned off my phone, and reinstalled. That doesn't help. I think I'm done.",
            "playing 3 Mobility Ware games until recently. Had to delete free cell first. now it's spider that's glitches. Stops working, juddering, shuts down my phone. Shame. Will switch to other card apps. UPDATE Oct 2020. Reinstalled working ok. Now plagued by Asian ads you can't read so dare not click on as no idea where it will take you. Then game freezes."

            "At first I viewed the pop-ups as an annoyance, but after awhile I began to click on the Fotoscapes & Lookbooks, which have very interesting pictures and articles, and found them to be quite enjoyable. Then I started trying out all the different games available, & found I enjoy playing them. I esp appreciate having access to all those games without having to download separate apps for each one. I look forward to seeing MetroZone when I turn on my phone now.",
            "Love the stories, articles, and pictures that are available on this app. However if you hit back at the wrong time or click on another story, you have lost that great item of whatever you were looking at for that moment. . So many good stories I was looking at but lost them that way. And still haven't found them. . Is there a way to avoid this???or solution to fix this..",
            "I absolutely HATE that every time I open my phone, this is popped up. And it's almost impossible to close with the combination of lag and the home bar not being on my screen. It'll click on an article when I try to swipe up to hit the home button. Then it takes ten years to finally close out the unwanted redirection. I'm seriously considering switching services because of this god awful pop up annoyance.",
            "Some of the information is not appropriate to watch and some give too much details. Which takes too long to get to end of story. If you lose page accidentally it hard to get back to where you left off. That make you not want to open story to fine out how, what, why,and when it happens. So I find myself just reading the captions and doing the few selections of pictures. Thank you always for your variety of subject matter.",
            "I did NOT ask for this app to automatically pop up once I unlock my phone!! It is extremely agrivating because I cannot just \"uninstall this app!?!?\" It is also very agrivating & annoying to try getting off of the app to get to my homescreen. I wish I had the option to use the app or not... Why even make a shortcut to access the app when it just (automatically) pops up???"

            "Good relaxing game but a lot of the challenges are on repeat or have multiple of the same ones. Currently on advanced level and keep seeing the same puzzles over and over again with each one i do. Wish there were larger more complicated ones with more variety. Its a bit too easy and a little boring. Still helps when im having anxiety though.",
            "This game is amazing!! But there is a flaw, the ads ughh! Its really really annoying . But this game would be a perfect game without the ads l tried to turn off my internet but the game cannot play without the internet.On the another side you should try it,or tell others about this game because it is awesome,amazing and wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!BYEüíëüíÉüòªüíëüíëüíë",
            "It's cool and relaxing, but the ads can be annoying. Hopefully, it's just 1$. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz of the sound effect when you win a level. Early levels are a breeze but it gets very annoying. A relaxing game should have a relaxing sfx not an overused indie win sfx. Either that or complete silence. I like the sound of the blocks touching each other but the win? So unfitting. And you can't turn off that specific sound. It's all or nothing. Smh",
            "The ads aren't really too bad. Unless there's been changes since some of the old reviews, you're looking at 1 ad every 3-4 levels (which can be skipped after 5 seconds) The game itself is a nice, satisfying mental workout. A good time killer and a bit addicting. Controls are fluid and intuitive, the difficulties are categorized properly, the quest for optimal solves is great. This is a hidden gem.",
            "Good puzzle game . I play when I have a bit of mild anxiety and it helps me concentrate. There isn't many ads at all so I don't get annoyed with that . Overall it's a 10/10 peaceful game . For free I have no complaints at all . Thanks."

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!‚ò∫",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

            "I find that sometimes there are technical problems such as the the screen being pixelated(like a television screen type of pixalation) or the app itself not working/crashing without reason (I already checked my internet provider and it seems like it wasn't the source of the problem). I hope such issues would be resolved in the future. The design of the app is very neat and clean. Also, It's great that you've put your policies in the display.",
            "Better than YouTube? Yes. Dailymotion has alot of content, movies to watch, a very clean interface and more up to date sleek channel design look, easy to browse, search filters for searching for videos. There are things which i would like to see for Desktop and Mobile. Dailymotion needs a night mode, the explore page needs a gaming and tech section, search filters needs to have more filters, bring back the thumb's up feature, the browse more section has too much sex and nudity kissing nonsense , that has nothing to do with what you're watching. Great site, but needs more features, but i do recommend Dailymotion over YouTube.",
            "Giving this a 5 stat just because google reeeeeally wants me to delete the app. Whenever I get a notification about deleting apps to make room daily motion is always near the top of the list, despite the fact there are apps I haven't used in almost a year near the bottom. It seems if it's not owned by a big tech corporation Google thinks it's a waste of space on my phone. Couldn't possibly be that google doesn't like a YouTube competator being on my phone.",
            "This actually regards the Smart TV app. It's horrible, logging me out often & we all know how tedious TV \"keyboards\" are for text entry. I have externally created playlists that do nothing. I can move to each playlist but clicking on it doesn't open it so all playlists are unplayable. Often, recommended videos start playing their audio stream in the background & can't be stopped. Other videos can't be played because unwanted, unstoppable content is already playing. Better 2 cast from Android app",
            "Some, if not most of the videos require following a link to sign up with details. Its hard to find series that you can just watch direct. Plus not all seasons and episodes are available. But as im persistent I take my time to click many videos before I find a link free episode, then enjoy that, but it can be time consuming. Glad it's free tho!"

It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

        "comments": [
            "4 stars only because planes can back into each other, bump into each other and sometimes go through each other depending on what planes and how many planes are in que. Also, making enough money to expand or upgrade is way too slow. The more I ply, the less I like this game. Getting what you need is really based on how much time you play the game at one time. Two stars now. This game is no longer fun to play. It's a chore.",
            "This game has improved it is still slow going unless you spend real dollars but now the bonus is that every 14 days you get one game dollar so there is the chance to advance even thought it is slow, it is now possible. Bad thing for me is now I am tempted to spend real funds to get to my goals quicker.",
            "I'm glad I didn't spend any money on the game for 2 reasons. 1)it really is not necessary to spend money if you're just a little patient. It does have advertising which you can watch instead of spending on the game. 2)I've got a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which is an above average smartphone in terms of its capabilities but the game frequently glitches necessitating closing & restarting which is a problem. Worse is that the developers don't acknowledge issues when reported. It's fun & addictive tho",
            "Since the latest update I'm not able to use my own comfort classes, only the free ones in every few hours. There's no possibility to use mine outside these free times. Also hawk planes often get stuck at the end of the runway and I have to close the game to make them go away. Takes an awful long time to collect coins.",
            "I LOVE this game. It is so involved and there is so much going on that once you level up a few times and you've got say 3 ore more planes and a couple of helicopters, you can literally stay busy constantly collecting passengers, money, exp. points etc...... that you can actually \"play\" the game for hours and your eyes and fingers never leave the screen. The special collections are so cool!! The only thing I don't like about it is a cost a lot of coins to upgrade buildings, buy aircraft etc."

            "Fun game...longest I have ever kept a game on my phone. LOVE that I don't have to sit through commercials in order to play or anything!! A few years, when I first started playing, I had the ability to win time...I miss that. Made it more fun to win an hour (up to 24 hrs) of free play time. Guess they lost too much $$ on people not buying items to help them pass a level. Oh well.",
            "I love this game. Great way to pass the time. I do have a couple of things. What if for every 100 levels you get one of each boost and 25 coins? Maybe bring back challenge of unlimited lives for a 24 hours? Sometimes it sucks when it takes 3 days to complete one level, it gets frustrating and boring. I have spent many hours playing this game and spent some money and do really enjoy it.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until it got to the higher levels (im on level 3564) I have spent plenty of money on this game because once you only get 5 free lives and when your out it takes 20 minutes to get another life. I understand the levels will get harder but I think its ridiculous to only get a new life every 20 minutes. I don't want to have to delete this app but I can't continue to spend $1.99-$12.99 just to be able to play continuously.",
            "I actually really love this game. there's no ads (!!!!!!) and there's really no need to spend money if u are patient. it's pretty much entirely luck based so as long as u are patient and keep trying u can pass any level. my only complaint is some of the levels seem unnecessarily hard which can get very frustrating but other than that I would highly recommend this game",
            "Play game all the time my only problem is that you have to continuesly have to update after doing 50 levels beyond 4000, and my Facebook friends dissappeared. Hey Doodle Bob I am a real person playing this game and yes I passed level 4000. I can honestly say, I have NOT spent any money on this game and do not plan on it. Just wait for lives to add up and continue to play."

I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "Great app with lots of tools and features. The only suggestion I have is to provide more blurring options because the blurring effect is too weak in this app. But that's the only thing that I've seen that could use a little extra of. Everything else is perfect. Very deserving of 5 stars and I've used many different apps. This one is the best!! Thank you for developing such an awesome app!!",
            "Fotogenic allows the user to intuitively highlight and accentuate photographic points of interest, eliminate distracting background/foreground features, and fully customise the appearance of the form, coloration, opacity, axis orientation, size/scale, focus, shading, brightness & vividness, overall design/detail, framing, and artistic implication of any digital photograph. From a consumer perspective, I highly recommend this app to beginner and adept on-the-go editors alike.",

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 √©nergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "Last update on Google play was sept 16, and today Oct 10 I am told my app is out of date. This is a security app, not tetris. Also, won't start automatically after restart sometimes. I have to manually start it (if I notice it's not running).",
            "Hello, my phone has been spammed. I thought this app is supposed to protect against that. Now I don't know how to stop the spamming. I keep getting messages that my phone will be locked if I don't install and pay for Spam protection.",
            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",
            "Still kinda on the fence with this app since switching over from a very corrupt AT&T. I can say that because I've been with them for over 20 years. They went bad about 4 years ago. Thank you Verizon.",
            "App doesn't allow Web security. You turn on 2 seconds later the app crashes I have no idea if I'm safe browsing on the Web > latest version 9/16 Issue still a problem !!!"

Your feedback would be much appreciated.",

It is nowhere in the current version (7.92) of the app. I've checked every option available. I've searched troubleshooting articles. I attempted to reach out to the gosms feedback as listed in Google play store, however, the email bounced back stating the mailbox was full. The website doesn't work either. Time to switch!",
            "I like it so far, I like that you can design your own background, text bubbles, color etc, but one thing I noticed is when I get a notification, pull it down and try to reply, the reply button does not appear. Pics wouldn't download after several hours. Update: Pics have been coming thru recently. Please make a way to search keywords in a rext conversation.",

But they IMMEDIATELY charged me $59.99. Google Play won't refund me and the developers email is full. If they respond to this review I will update the rating. Now I need to call my bank."

            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "I have played this game now for around 2 years and loved it until last week. Every time you watch a video for extra items, lives or to play on at the end of a level the game crashes. I have completed everything they recommend and even reinstalling this and still crashes. I have now lost all my lollipop hammers (10 of each). Messaged them (King) and not willing to help or admit there is a problem which clearly there is from others comments below. Very disappointed after all this time.",
            "Sometimes you can watch a video to either have a special candy or to get a few extra moves, however quite frequently when the watch video button is clicked, it just shuts the app down completely. It would be 5 stars if it wasn't for this really annoying bug. Please fix and I'll change my rating.",
            "Game is always crashing. Sometimes I don't get rewards after watching adds. Events never work. And it's impossible to contact anyone about it. I've tried and I got a copie pasted email back. Useless. Update, a few days after writing my review I lost all my candy ( the lollipops) that I've been collecting for years. Literally Year. Gone",
            "I have been playing this for a while now, and it does get tricky every now and then, but it is very playable . However this morning, when the game loads, then the level screen, then play, then watch video, the game shuts itself off! And then back to starting the app again, has this been caused by an update, as last night it worked perfectly. Overall my impressions are good, nice graphics, pleasing sounds, some levels do get annoying, but that is all part of the game, 85/100.",
            "Great game with lots of free treats. You can get stuck for 2 or 3 days though, even on a classic level,. 7 months later I'm still playing but now it switches off when I try to download an ad. I've taken advice to switch off my tablet completely but it has not improved. Pity because it's a great game."

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zanyüëåüëåüòé",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "it's still buggy. getting worse, even. the more I use it, the more it crashes and lags. I would rather have that fixed than a new design. and now the coin purchase isn't working either, and sometimes tapping the heart to like does nothing. there was nothing wrong with the layout, please fix the bugs. I want to be able to read the comics. even now, I would like to be able to buy more coins and I literally can't",
            "Firstly, I saw many, many advertisements on instagram for this app and decided to give it a shot. And I'm in love with webtoon now. No joke. There are a lot of other web comic apps, but this one seems to be the only one without a pay wall from what I have found. You can buy coins to read ahead with a fast pass, or be patient and wait for weekly updates on many of the series. Overall good experience and lots of amazing stories.",
            "Honestly, while I do enjoy this app, I'm kind of annoyed that they removed the option to buy $20 worth of coins. That and I get they need to make money, but let's be realistic here, the whole \"one free comic a day of comics that are completed and were once entirely free to read in a day\" thing is kind of meh. You can pay to read them more often, even though the comics again were ENTIRELY FREE BEFORE. You wanna read a 70 chapter story? You have to do it over 70 days, unless you wanna pay.",
            "I love the contents of this app, but I can't ignore the constant glitches. One of the worst ones is that I have participated in 2 seperate events for free coins, and when I went to collect my reward it glitches and I lose out on the free coins. As far as I can tell there is no way to contact them when something like this happens. A Google search for support just takes you to there FAQS forum which doesn't help. I guess use the app, but don't bother with the events.",
            "I used webtoon nearly daily about 6 months ago, then my phone broke and I had to wait to get a new one. I forgot about Webtoon, but once I remembered it, I was excited. All my favorite storys must have gotten tons of new episodes. And then, the new Pass was revealed. I didn't mind fast Pass,Daily pass is stupid. Part of the charm to the comics is that you can spend 30 minutes sitting down enjoying your story chapter by chapter. Now imagine taking all of that away, to 1 chapter. Very short read."

            "I LOVE THIS APP. I've had it for about 2 years now and it works perfectly. The updates are working and I don't experience any glitches and problems. All my favourite books are written on the app and getting to know the writers and the rest of the Wattpaders is really awesome and fun. I can write my chapters properly, only problem is, I'm worried it does not save or publish properly as it gives me false information and can be confusing. But nonetheless, great reading app!! Highly recommended.",
            "Helloooo. I'm writing this to say that I like the previous version of wattpad. When I open the app, it doesn't take long for the stories to appear. Now, I still need to open the internet to see my library which is a bit of a hassle. If I may recommend, please return the previous versions. The one without the need to download offline stories, because seriously, I don't like the update. I've been on wattpad since 2011 and so far, this is the worse update for me.",
            "The app itself is good but lately, i have been experiencing a lot of events such as one time I was writing a story that was worth about 600+ words but then a warning popped up saying \"wattpad has suddenly stopped\" which as you may know, all of the things i written wasn't saved. It broke my heart because I've been wanting to finish i but I have to restart and write it again. I hope that you can fix this. If so maybe the problem is my device.",
            "I'm using wattpad since 2014. Every year I saw how it changed. I'm missing the old wattpad when there is no Ads (every chapter), you can read different stories without paying for it, and you can add many stories in your library. Idk, what are the creators are thinking, lol. I just hope that the next update will get more better (lessen the ads and remove the limit of stories you can add in your library for offline reading)",
            "I totally want the Old Wattpad back. Everything is far different of what I used to love about this app. I've been using this app for almost 10 years and I know that the creator wants to improve it and earned money from it but this is too much. I have been experiencing some moments when I can't read because I need to connect to Internet but I'm already connected and that confuse me..."

It has nothing to do with it being mosty free, which is up to you to pay, but with all the free options, I have no idea what's included with the paid version! A MUST DOWNLOAD!! ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!! Thanks so much for such an awesome Photo Editing App!! Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!",
            "besides the excessive ads and the impending fear of not being able to use the app at all (for the purpose I downloaded it for) thanks to the forceful hand of a monthly-paid membership,, this app works great. it's literally the only thing I've found where I'm able to edit moodboards the way I've been wanting to, so I thank it for that",
            "This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for like 2 years now. If you understand all the features (which are so many), you won't ever need any other photo editing app. It has no logos after making a collage or editing, great layouts , different sizes with ratios and options while making collage to crop , swap , delete , anything. You can choose the border or just have no borders. it's just awesome. Thanks for the app makers.",

            "Ive been using Pandora for three years, and lately I've been having issues. Whenever I choose a specific song on my playlist it doesnt play it and ends up playing a different song on my playlist. I updated it and everything, and it still hasnt been fixed. I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",
            "I've had continuous problems with pandora since I got it. I download songs and playlists, then when I try to play them, it says I haven't downloaded them. It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",
            "I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years now. I love no ads. Since Last update, Pandora just stops working and closes. I thought it was my phone. Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",
            "Used to work great but now it will shuffle through all songs without playing them , the songs will pop up then the next one will pop up while no music is heard or can be played. I've uninstalled multiple times and can't figure out the issue. I want my refund back because I can't use the app or listen to the song I want"

            "I like that it gives you the location you are currently located in, upon opening the application for usage. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because if you are on the AT&T network, it would make more sense to not need to have paid for a monthly subscription, and also because the basic mode, that is free of charges to utilize, but only if you do not agree to the upgrade charging your phones billing account, does not use verbally (spoken) directions, to assist the device owner, or individual using the application for navigation, to hear the directions; you must look at the device you are using to see the navigational directions in this application, which I personally feel is a contradiction to the \"It Can Wait\" campaign.",
            "this is a sleazy app. I just got off the phone with AT&t after finding out that I've had a 2-year reoccurring charge for this application. I have never used this app I only use Google maps, so when I ask for e-mail verification or some kind a verification where I would have agreed to the monthly charge they stated that sometimes it comes through text messaging so if you click on the link that is your agreement for your monthly payments. At least I got a $30 credit out the $240+ I already paid."

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",

            "It's a good app. I like what Microsoft is going with it so far, with a productivity first approach. I would like to see some more customization options though, like App folder \"Covers\" in Action Launcher. You can have quick access to one app with a tap, while keeping the rest of the folders behind a swipe (or a long press). I like to keep a clean desktop, & that'd go a long way to cleaning clutter. I look forward to further updates & features.",
            "Just seems to make sense so far after all the others that just come close but ever just get there. I've tried every one of them. They just seem to leave one particular area unattended to. This one just seems to basically cover everything. I'm sticking with it until I see something better. It's a delicate balance between form and function. It cannot be just about one or the other alone. All the others looked cool and all but, they seemed to have been uncompleted somehow.",
            "I was bored of my system launcher after using it for 3 straight years. And eventually I came across Microsoft launcher and voila I loved it very much , it's very systematic and user friendly. There are few bugs and issues like \"Your feed\" doesn't load calendar events. But apart from that , it's the best launcher in the store.",
            "Absolutely love this!! I love how we can customise literally EVERYTHING been trying to look for something like this for so long and never would've thought Microsoft has a launcher and it is this good! I downloaded it initially so I can sync the clipboard for the stuff I copied and pasted Little did I know this launcher is actually this amazing My fav is that the \"subgrid\", \"your feed\" and that I can swip vertically for my home pages Anyways 5/5 for sure!!",
            "Absolutely brilliant. Clean simple and smooth. There is one thing I would like to see in a future update and that would be for an option to change the color of the gray overlay on left screen and the opacity. I personally would like to change this to a solid black to match my dark theme. Thank you for a wonderful launcher"

            "I'm using this app for 5 years specially for picture editing, it used to be the best. But your update sucks. Hope you'll bring back the old, productive and useful interface.",
            "I used to love it, now I hardly use it. Why fix something that's not broken. I don't like that they added unnecessary things to it. I enjoyed being able to put a natural filter, maybe edit out a blemish or two (which now I cannot seem to), and straighten my picture out. It was simple, easy to navigate and use. I don't mind the added filters because they're fun but the rest is too much. Leave the excessive retouching to Facetune, I don't need to make my face smaller, adjust the size of my lips, give myself a face lift, etc. Other have also mentioned the portrait mode, and fine adjustments that we could do back then like adjust separate colors, etc.",
            "This was the only photo editing tool I needed until the update. All I had to do to get a \"perfect\" picture, was go to the facial editing section, put the smoothness to around 40, save & go. Every photo came out looking flawless and still real! Never overdone. Now, if it doesn't recognize a face, you can't even use the facial editing tools. Even if you could, the \"smoothness\" option is gone anyway. I have no use for this app anymore. I don't even know what to download instead. So disappointing.",
            "Updated: This was far better before few updates. The filters were easy to access, there were multiple grain/particle effects in Adjust menu now there's only one; the overall user interface for photo editing was one of its kind before. So, this was my only favorite. Now it's more like other apps like Youcam and Picsart. Hope to see some old features back.",
            "This app is useless. Take one photo, leave it for a few seconds, try to take another photo an dot freezes. Have to click the X 15 damn times to close it and then reopen only to have it crash again. Does the same tying on my other other, does the same thing even after I wiped out the phone three times, does the same thing no matter if I change the storage path from device to chip. The ads are annoying even when I subscribed. The popups for filters are annoying, if I want it I will select it."

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

        "comments": [
            "It's a fun game most of the time. Addictive, too. But sometimes the game seems determined to take all your coins back, and I don't know if that's on purpose to make you buy more, or what? Edited: After gaining more experience in the games, and winning quite a bit, I do appreciate the \"lifelike\" experience, but still find certain things a little frustrating, such as a challenge to get 40 Sloto Card Stars to complete my Daily Dash, and taking until 11:59 pm to be awarded enough Cards to finish.",
            "GLITCHY THEIVES! The game was fun until it started to glitch! Then the reels would spin and not stop. I updated it hoping it would be better but it just made it WORSE! I tried to turn in my stars for a spin on the Super Wheel, not only did the wheel not stop spinning but once the error message appeared my cards and stars were GONE! I didn't get any prizes for them or compensation! Like I said, GLITCHY THEIVES!!",
            "It's good that there is no ads to worry about. The game flow is fine. But if I decide to put money into this game I find no real gain from it. Game goes into immediate lockdown. It will run me right out of the coins I paid real money for. This isn't a real casino. I dont stand to win real money. If I pay for chips I expect to get a boost out of the game instead of being shutout. Not a good business model. You can change your algorithms on your game. Make it worth players time. We pay. You don't.",
            "As John Goodman says you never know what today will spin! It is an exciting game, the graphics are great and you are not constantly interrupted by ads! I count some of the people in my clan as friends, we play as a group on challenges and it is competitive fun! New games and challenges keep it fresh! Once you play Slotomania, you will not want to play other slots games. It's that good! The seasonal games and prizes are terrific! Grafics are terrific!!!",
            "I'm through buying anything in this app. Real life happens to everyone. In the last three days of NOT buying, I've received a star spin in half hours and hour spins ONCE !!! can tell you when I was buying, it was almost Everytime spin stars. They let me know how they are I'm a level 2679 !!!! I'll still play with my clan, but No More Buying !!!!!"

The coin walls pop up half way and all info dissappears off the screen like coins, level, boosts etc oh and when the coins fall off at the end.. They just stay there.. Building up in a great big pile. And you never did sort out the coin regeneration issue.. I should have well over 65 coin limit now.. But instead it's about 44.",

Was playing halloween game, everytime I tried to open it to get prizes the whole thing locked up, I finally got frustrated and uninstalled then reinstalled started from beginning lost all prizes, levels, dd and all levels, I'm not starting over I'm just going to uninstall and play coin pusher you always have plenty of coins. Very disappointed in this game very poorly designed.. bye",

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

            "Would be 5 but developer wanted feedback. Its a recording app. Only way to screw it up is to cram it with ads and push for feedback. Either way. Guess it's nice to get a pat on the back every now and then. And they do deserve it. It's a pretty good app with minimal ad interruption. So if you need to record something download the app. And to the creator. Thanks",
            "Firstly, I don't know why people give this app less than 4stars. Something is really wrong with them . This voice recorder is overall a very good app. The best feature I think it has is the voice editor. It is a blessing for me because my phone's voice recorder is just bollocks.... thats ittt !! So yes...well done.",
            "This is a great app I have enjoyed using. It provides clear recording sound, allows you to mix background sounds with the lead recording, you can trim your recordings add introduce a different voice to your original track. Your can do all these and many on a phone... It's a great thing that I recommend. If there's a PC version please send me the link to download, if there isn't then I suggest the developer should his/her way to get me one. The video recorder from you will be great too. Bravo!",
            "Love the app! Very good at picking up audio (sometimes even too good, but that can be changed in mixing). Would rate 6 stars if it had built-in filters that change the sound. But I get that this is a recording app and I shouldn't expect or even hope for that, so I will still rate 5 stars. Also, make it so the app doesn't fall asleep. I have a fingerprint phone, so it hears the vibration it makes. Again, a spectacular app. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good sound.",
            "Very easy to use. Recording and playback functions are upfront. The ability to share to email and other methods is very easy. Minimal ads and for a free to use product, it was worth it to watch a commercial here and there. Overall, I would recommend this app if you need a simple option to record a message or note or in my case a briefing that I had to do."

They seem to just be spewing out rehashes of levels and the only updates appear to be efforts to wind back rewards and get as much money as they can out out of players before they cut and run. From a good game to one of the most boring in a few updates. Got a few months free play then zip, uninstall. Don't bother, money grubbers. Not worth it.",
            "I loved this game starting out but now that I'm in the 3000 plus levels I hardly win. The earthworm challenges are almost impossible to beat. Theres some fun little challenges but unless you can beat at least 10 levels you dont get the rewards. Be ready to spend a lot of money to buy gold to be able to beat levels. I've been playing since 2017 but I haven't hardly played in the last couple weeks. Probably gonna be uninstalling it very soon. Feels like more work than fun anymore",
            "This game has become unplayable without buying gold. I'm on level 3650. You can spend hours doing one level which is boring. If they added one move each time you failed a level it wouldn't be too bad, but you have to fail numerous times before a move gets added. The league tables are a joke as well , instead of being called the \"Championship of Great Britain\" it should be called the \"Championship of Who Can Afford the Most Gold\". I used to love this game to the point of obsession, not now tho'.",
            "It's a really fun, cute puzzler and the challenge is good. However I disagree with some of the micro transaction tactics. Constantly being left at the end of a level being 1 move short due to the RNG of the blocks dropping from the top where you need them to line up is very frustrating and you are tempted to buy extra moves with real money which I disagree with. The fiend styles are pretty cool though and are maybe worth buying to support the game. Not extra moves!",
            "OMG, you keep changing how the game scores making it harder to earn points. Stop changing how points are earned. After 3 years of playing, I'm about to quit. I play games for fun and pleasure, not to be fustrated by playing a level repeatedly that can't be skipped. I'm going on a long break from this game. Hopefully you make it fun again when I come back. Also, File size is getting too big."

            "This is a fun and addictive game. However, it's really buggy lately. Customer service is a crapshoot. When I got assigned David Jarryd, he only responded every 24 hours, didn't understand English and either only partly solved the problem or not at all. I made purchases that wouldn't include all of the items. Their response on here is to contact them on FB. I tried that, too. No response. I highly recommend that you avoid this game.",
            "I love it but sometimes lose the connection. But still the best game ever. I love the events please keep them coming would love events every day and maybe make available the chance to win more rolls some how as I always run out. Love playing with my friends and family but can we get more prizes and more options to add more friends and be rewarded for having over 30. Play every day and enjoy everytime so thank you developers for creating an exciting wonderful game x",
            "This game was good. Don't bother buying anything from the store as after you do the game doesnt let you land on good tiles ever! My friend and I are on the exact same board is board appears to work fine and actually allow him to make progress. All I get is rubbish. Fix the game you money hungry fake creators",
            "To be very honest, I really love the game and its addictive too. But I don't like when the level and dice counts increases, the time doesnt decreases because of this it makes less interactive to the game. As it seems the real problem what I'm facing till now. I think you must decrease the time because it makes people uninstall more early. I feel like that but I dint want to do that. I love the game. You should think of this problem.",
            "Overall it's a cute game to play whenever. But, I'm constantly get false notification. Like while im playing every few second, saying my dice cap is full or mini games is ending soon. Literally getting these while I'm actively playing. Im always getting kicked out. I have spent more on this game than I should, I feel like you don't get much for what your buying. Even though I have bought packs, I still haven't got my last card of my album. I've been trying to get the last card for over a month."

        "comments": [
            "Love Outlook! Always have! I've used other formats & platforms over the years, when working at someone else's house or office, or using equipment not my own, but nothing has ever come close to matching the complete package that is Outlook. It's extremely user friendly & even the tech-challenged can usually sort their way through pretty much any function, with relative ease. I have always used Outlook & at 55 years old, don't imagine I'll be changing anytime soon.",
            "I use this for work. There is often an extremely long delay between getting a notification for an email and actually being able to view it. The email will be instantly available in Outlook online, but can take up to 5 minutes to load in mobile. The app sends notifications for meetings 15 minutes in advance, but clearing the notification in any way just results in the app resending the notification. Oh, it does the same thing with \"meeting has ended\" notifications. Atrocious app design.",
            "On my old Samsung phone I had the outlook app and NEVER had problems with it. I have had a new phone for 2 weeks and this app has had endless problems. It freezes, it doesn't load emails, it won't send emails and every variation in between. I have followed online suggestions to clear the cache and data and yes the problem is solved for no more than 1 day. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app and again the problem is solved for a day and then back to having the same issues. Woeful!",
            "Whilst I love the features of Ms Outlook, the app has pitfalls. I will receive a notification of a new email, click to review said email and it will be no where to be found. Refresh, refresh, nothing! However, if I go on the desktop web version I will see everything as it is to date. ... This app defeats the purpose of having a mobile service if I always have to draw for my laptop to review emails.",
            "This version of Outlook (mobile, Android) seems appropriately scaled down to suit small screen and \"keyboard\" use and appears to have been optimised for email. Most (or maybe all?) of its original functionality is there, but some features might need a bit of hunting, until you learn how to find them. . Great to be able to use full strength email via phone, with that robust corporate look & feel that Outlook is known for."

            "Been playing for awhile and got enough coins to cash out for a voucher, however everything is showing as sold out. I'm using the UK version so maybe people will have a better experience in other countries. Update I have logged in several times through the day and all show as sold out. I also do not understand the new piggy bank, how do you collect nuts and bolts?, how do you heist from other players?",
            "It was good. Then it was not so good, introduced piggy bank... A way to spend tokens in hopes of winning more. Prize was tokens and blackjack hands. New piggy is worse.. I don't even get tokens, just get jerked around by the piggy. I know I will never get the last nickel to cash out at$10, doesn't bother me, liked the gift cards. I know I will never get anything from the piggy. I just keep coming back hoping I will get one last gift card. And I cannot find your help center.",
            "Worst app ever!!!. Once you are approaching the minimum withdrawal then they won't give you any cash anymore and, I am just 0.15 away.They just let you watch a lot of advertisements over and over again. I won't recommend this app. Now they have an update to heist from some other players too. Nah it just goes on in circles over and over again.No withdrawal has been made.I have been playing it for a while. Highly won't recommend this app.",
            "Waste of time. Period. Deleting now with no regrets despite being $0.25 away from cashing out (For 1-2weeks of multi-daily check-ins to the app). My gut says I'll never see a dime and my time is better spent elsewhere on games and activities I actually enjoy. Download at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you! Edit: After that response, I'm confident that I'm right. They make vague and empty promises so they can make more money through their scam.",
            "Has been slow for cash payouts but I have gotten a few gift cards.. Now this app sucks. Doesn't pay out. You get enough tokens and all of a sudden its sold out... used to be legit. Beats paying for scratchers but man change the payout system back to what it was a year ago and I will change my rating back to 5 stars. Took a legit app and made it a SCAM or just near damn impossible to get any gift cards. Fun to pass the time but doesn't pay out anymore üôÉ"

            "Wow! I am so impressed with this App! It's very easy to use. It shows you how to do the exercises and it even counts the seconds for you!!! It's definitely motivating! Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! üôÇ",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! üëç",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high ratingüòÇ Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

            "I like this app. I really do. But I'm sorry, the watermark thing has to go. It's pointless, for what? Too much ads as well. I cant even download a pic without getting 2 or more ads. I can only download maybe like 5 pictures before my last watermark runs out. These two features are making my experience with this app lower. I understand the ads, advertising, I know. But too much ads. I just don't understand the watermark. Without the Watermark, I would've definitely rated this app 4 stars.",
            "Great app but it could be more useful if users were able to write articles with the app.",
            "Have been a user since 2014.. please stop this watermark thing no one does this it's insane I love this app but that's too much .. listen to your users. Thank you",
            "I have three suggestions: 1. Make your interface look better. It's a really early 2000s look going on and you can do better. 2. When you refresh your discover page it really does nothing but give you the same feed just with 3 or 4 new pictures at the top. I'm pretty sure you're not having a shortage of pictures or something so please improve upon this. 3. The watermark thing has to go. Period. Y'all wildin.",
            "I used to LOVE this app to the point I was a heartist for 3 years in a row, I had deleted it for a while to come back to it being a money pit; want to download so many pictures you have to buy a membership, don't want ads buy the membership, ect. its ridiculous, the app used to be a fun outlet for creativity and now half my pictures are under review and its things like plants and art, I really miss the way it used to be, dont bother getting it anymore unless you want to spend $$ over pictures üò¢"

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 secondsü•∂üò¨üò¨ Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "Always easy to use and very helpful tips and things in the app. Also very easy to contact if you need to but you can find the answer to almost anything you need right am the cricket app. Super easy to change plans and features and it gives you the option to start changes today or at next billing cycle which I love. I have loved the cricket experience so far and I've been a customer for about six months now and would recommend anyone with a contract to think about switching. Low monthly plans.",
            "EDITED Review: Initially it worked great. Five dollars off with auto pay via app. Cool, ty. Then it started saying my debit card wasnt up to date (its 2 months old) when all was correct. To pay over the phone or in person there is a \"customer service\" fee. So between the 5 I would get from auto pay savings and the fee I pay 10 additional dollars per month because of this faulty app. Essentially I have been repaying 1/3 of my bill due to their error.",
            "Data stinks and my phone slows to fast and I have access unlimited data. U can't even get a new phone. I rather go to simply mobile or metro pcs. The phone I bought was from rent a center years ago, it's a Samsung galaxy J7(2016) version. So it's not a cricket model, I haven't had a cricket phone since several years because I was having problems with every phone. Metro will let you get a free phone for Switching. I'm on a very tight budget and fixed income.",
            "Besides the fact that the app sometimes won't work. There is the issue that when you have a phone that's not working it's hard to get in contact with anyone. I've even tried the customer service line for my cell phone. But without being able to review the items that we purchase through cricket, they aren't really able to know when a company is providing crappy product. I've also had an issue with the last two devices that I've purchased not being able to connect to wifi!",
            "Their websites don't work, their app doesn't work! Made faithful payments for over four years. Missed my payment on the 1st But it wasn't due till the 2nd. Tried to make payments all day on the 2nd and couldn't get through. Then I get charged $15 because I make the payment 9 hours late the day after. When you called to complain the manager will just hang up on you! Even if you don't swear! Worst company! Most of them don't understand English!"

            "Constant download errors until update fixed the problem. Works as advertised now! Thanks for fixing.",
            "Almost unusable. My subscriptions expired, but I never received an email informing me about that. When I ran the app it never notified me about expired subscriptions. When I tried to open a magazine, it simply wouldn't open - no error message, just eternal spinning waiting icons. I only realized what the problem was when I was able to open older issues but not newer ones. I tried to purchase a new subscription, but wasn't able to find any way to accomplish the task - I could only find an option to buy an individual issue, which was NOT what I wanted. I've had it with this really crappy app. I'm switching to Readly.",
            "I have been using Zinio for quite awhile now. Magazines downloads are high quality. No problem there. The reason I am leaving Zinio is the constant barrage of offers and sales notifications. If you want to be notified when a magazine is ready for download you also get their marketing notifications. It's constant and there is no way to opt out from them.",
            "Just like everyone else, cannot log in after a factory reset, says a unexpected error has occured and check conection when conection is 100% ok. Also need the ability to store magazines on sd card as this app eventually will fill internal memory so you have to ditch previous magazines that you have paid for to read new editions. Just not good enough. The app also says that if i log out all previous magazines will be lost, WHY? We need to have the choice to SAVE with the option to save as a pdf",
            "I can redo the review as Zinio did sort out a problem that meant I could not get recent editions like several other reviewers. Unexpected error try again, network. All reviewers got the same cut & paste answer After uninstalling and re- installing 3 times over several days it finally worked again. Seeing the app version numbers my suspicion is a faulty update caused the problems. The last re install had a different app revision. Zinio could have been more upfront if this was the problem."

No option to program it not to block those numbers so I have to turn the blocking off. Also everything prompts you to go premium...I thought the last uncarrier move said this would be free? Now it just feels like a additional ploy to get money out of us...sneaky.",
            "It's been a long time coming for this app and finally its here Thank you T-mobile I no longer have to go through phone call after phone call. I would get more phone calls from scammers more than my own personal calls on a daily I never wanted to answer my phone cause I just knew it was probably a scam of some sort I can't explain how annoying that is. So thank you so very much T-mobile....",
            "**Response to developer: Scam block is already turned on, it just doesn't work very well. Make the app better instead of blaming your customers please.** Doesn't block very many calls, but has blocked calls from contacts. That can be fixed by adding them to favorites, but it's still annoying. I liked it better when the TMobile system would say \"scam likely\" which seems to have been discontinued after this app launched. It sounds good but doesn't work very well.",
            "Useless, reroutes spam callers to voicemail. Basic app notifications are locked behind paywall. Just download Google Phone cause unlike this it's free, it works, and you can mark callers as spam from the phone app immediately, unlike this where you wait hours . App has a problem where voicemail calls and unknown numbers call don't appear, so you cannot mark them as spam. The entirety of this should be free for all T-Mobile customers. Better yet opensoure it, so people can fix it.",
            "At first this worked great. I wasn't getting any calls that ever said scam likely. Until the last few weeks I have been receiving four or five calls a day from a number that has the same area code and prefix as my number. I block the number, just to get another call from the same area code and prefix. Of course I don't answer. I block, they change the last four digits in their number and call again within 10 minutes."

            "I recently switched to a Samsung phone. I'm an avid tumblr user. although the app for iPhone works perfect, so far my experience here has been terrible. I can't scroll through my feed without it glitching a hundred times! Whenever I reblog I'm pushed back all the way to the top of my feed and I lose my spot. plus anywhere you touch on the screen, it will start glitch out and do the opposite of what you want to do. I've been able to make it work, but they need to fix this immediately! üëé",
            "Laggy, blurry images, and buggy. Even for just browsing, I run into problems. Reblogging anything takes you back up to the top of the page w/endless scrolling. All images are blurry and poor quality, plus there's some serious lagin loading them at times. Posting options are extremely limited and many core functions are missing. Overall it's clunky, frustrating and disappointing.",
            "the app is basically unusable. Every time you reblog a post or even so much as open an image your dashboard will refresh and scroll all the way to the most recent post. Oh you were zooming in on a photo you wanted to reblog after 10 minutes of scrolling? Too bad it's gone now! Please for the love of god fix this, I know I'm not the only one with this issue :/",
            "Please for the love of god fix the feature that skyrockets me back to the top of my dashboard every time I click on a picture, video, notes or reblog something. If you're going to have endless scrolling then maybe make sure that it doesn't lose its place every time I try and interact with a post. Sick of starting at the top and trying to scroll down to find my place again. And while I'm at it, how about fixing the video player so I can watch a 6 second vine without it buffering 10 times.",
            "I like Tumblr as a website, but this app is terrible and has been for as long as I've had a Samsung. Each update only seems to make things worse. Less convinient, more clunky to navigate, and more glitchy. My notifications have NEVER worked properly, sometimes it just sends you back to the top of your feed, and the new tagging interface is an inconvenient pain. Please get everything working properly before adding useless interface changes we have to readjust to for no reason and LESS convenience"

            "Good. Could be better. Typical match 3 game, tho it makes you think it's a strategy game. At least if you get stuck it won't take you weeks to progress like Candy Crush. But it seems like I have completed the same room multiple times. And it costs too many coins for purchases; especially since you can only accumulate them a few at a time.",
            "Fun and exciting. U never know what's coming next. I'm about to change my mind, not so fun now. Using up all my points to greet people, pet dog, or find a key, and can't decorate the mansion. Crazy. Should not loose your points for stuff like that. Where's the decorating? Another thing, removing and adding a new sign should b on the same points.",
            "Now I'm changing my review based on a weird bug. I won unlimited lives for an hour and 20 minutes and as soon as 20 minutes was up the game froze and refused to progress for no reason. When I pushed on the button for the next puzzle the UI disappeared. So I thought maybe it was a problem with the game installation and reinstalled it. Now I have zero progress at all and lost my halloween decorations which I was almost complete with. Uninstalled until you fix it and restore my account.",
            "I love the game but some boards have taken me weeks, it's driving me crazy! But other then that it's a great game! I really like my Group!! Keep up the great work maybe make a few boards just a little easier!! I wish we could get another chance to do rooms we didn't finish!! I've been Playing this for over a Year and I still play everyday! Just a few fixes would make this Awesome! TY",
            "It's a fun game. I've just started it, but so far, I've found it gives you a fair chance to win without buying coins, plenty of challenges to win rewards and extra playing time, and it decorates much more quickly than similar games, which is satisfying. Hopefully this trend will continue as I move up levels."

            "The game is fun, but a lot of money is necessary in order to be competitive. Additionally, customer service is HORRIBLE! Because of glitches in the game, events are often dysfunctional. And even when screenshots are provided, customer service denies everything and never satisfies the customer. Additionally, when the desert oasis was \"upgraded\", I had bought a package that provided 10 additional territories, but I was only given five. I showed them multiple screenshots of their own ad, &.",
            "I have been part of the Lewz community since November 2016. There has always been a gap between money players and those just grafting for rewards. It was manageable and we had fun. However, over the last nine months the additions and changes to the game have been vast and heavily weighted towards big spenders. Not only that. Previous purchases and efforts are being devalued drastically, particularly in the desert oasis event, re gold coins. Only option: REPORT to Google Play!"

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",
            "Was running fine & progressing nicely until it tried to force me to accept a Facebook policy, I cannot accept the cookies as screen won't drag to press accept as screen size has changed, so it means I'm no longer able to send help/ items to friends or ask for help with reports at the end of each case, also feeding pets has changed to adverts only which now takes forever....really disappointed & frustrated so please change it back to 5 min timers & cut the excessive adverts for everything"

            "I absolutely love this game have been playing for a few month now but the last update has caused nothing but trouble it freezes shuts down when it wants way too many ads UPDATE much improved still the odd glitch but i can live with that big thanks to whoever fixed the bugs in the game im back to playing daily and its back to being my fav game üëçüòäüòä",
            "I love this game so much but the ads are ruining it lately. When you end a level, the game shows you what you earned. Before you can receive it, you have to watch an ad. (Wasnt a problem until recently) some ads will let you skip after a few seconds but lately if you try to skip the ad it takes you to google and then when you try to go back to the game it restarts onnect and you loose everything you earned on the previous level. Very frustrating. I love the game other than that.",
            "The game is just entertaining enough to keep going back, but the 30 second ads are ridiculous. Some other games have 5 second ads which don't interrupt the flow of the game. But this game has a 30 second ad after every puzzle which is irritating. I'm not sure the game is entertaining enough to keep putting up with the long ads.",
            "Bleh. One level the movements operate a certain way, the next level it won't move the same way. If the game is so damned moody why give it a time limit? That's kinda dumb.",
            "A very mindless game, perfect for playing while commuting, on the bus, waiting for someone or something etc. Easy play, but not unchallenging, with ads removed most times i don't need to watch commercials, unless you don't ƒèefuse the bomb! A basic match two game, but don't think it's a pushover, the concept is easy, playing it is a different matter!"

            "Good app. Finally showing room sizes in the search results. Please add room size filters to save time searching. Hotel star rating often does not match the real rating, for example many 5 stars properties are actually 4 stars or unrated. Prices can often be misleading as they do not include fees and taxes until the final step of booking, and then the final price can end up to be significantly higher. Final prices should be listed at early stages and we should be able to filter by them too.",
            "I made a booking and then I found a cheaper price though someone else at the same property. I tried to cancel the booking and have the cancellation fees waived and when it came time for me to hit the confirm the fee waiver button it went straight to cancelled for $65.00. I literally found the other price less than five minutes later and immediately cancelled the booking.......smh. Bad Business.",
            "Terrible app. Too many bugs to list, and I couldn't even write them to tell them about it because the Google Recaptcha just kept asking me to select images over and over again. Oh, and after trying 5 different times to book a flight, I got \"reservation failed\" with no explanation. One time, when I went back to reserve, the same flight I tried to book initially went up $70. Oh, and you'll have to scroll back about 420 times to enter your DOB cause you can't enter it manually. What a joke.",
            "Frankly the app is really great. I usually check the googles and find hotels online. Then i open up booking and compare prices. 90% of the time the mobile booking app has deals and tends to be cheaper by $10 to $30. Not much but that extra $10 can go towards a meal or something else like the mini bar. I love it and i recommend to all my travel buddies.",

            "Constantly crashing...... this app would allow you the odd video for a booster or extra few moves, but every video link crashes the app which means you lose where you were, and can't progress anywhere. I get the whole idea is to encourage you to buy etc, but the app should still function. Really tempted to just give up. Shame, had been a good boredom buster up to this point.",
            "Candy Crush Soda Saga is the best and fun game i've ever played...it has so so many levels that you can play...some are hard and some are easy to play...i really never thought that i could play this game as i'm playing it now..level 920 isthe hardest level in the game but is fun to play it again and again...",
            "I used to enjoy the game. But, as you progress the levels, the fish are of no use. It seems like they deliberately go to the wrong places when you are in the final moves of any hard level. This leads to the loss of streak as well. Why are the fishies acting all weird?!!",
            "At first is a interesting game, but once you've got to hard level, became really bad and boring for that reason your lucky that i give you 1 star. ..but I won't spend my money buying, life's, this game really this game really sucks cause freeze every time once you reach higher level. ..fix the problem if you're charging all those gifts..what about golden reward? I I hate it when I get to higher level past 100 it freezes and I have to uninstal the game..",
            "Its like when you are playing the game, it wants you to use their moves, which may be way up at the top of the board., and its ludicrous to use their moves, that they are trying to make u use. Thats using up your tries. Makes no sense to use their moves suggestions. And if you don't use their suggestion, they make it difficult to try your own moves, it will get stuck until u use their moves. Almost said their dumb suggestions, because they want you to fail. I earned 13 gold bars, r gone. ."

Some social media pictures and details are fake. I will rate after upgrade.",

            "I'm disappointed, I've been using the app for free for few months now. There are some futures that i can't use since i need to purchase those, but still it was fine i can still edit my videos. However now it suddenly wants me to pay or get a free trial for 3 days. What's wrong here? It was fine until last week. I can't afford the app for some reasons and it's too expensive for me P.s. they fixed it i, can export my videos now. Thanks",
            "I love this app before because it's free to use for editing videos.. but this month I just noticed that is not free anymore. I can't edit my videos for free. I tried to uninstall then reinstall it but still the same.. need to pay for it before I can edit a video.",
            "This App is one of the coolest apps ever....it doesn't have a lot of ads popping and it has so many features and the video that we want turns out in high quality...and I am really surprised and thankful that such a great app is takes really less space in mobile...and once again cool app",

Try again.\" It also says that I have not been to any of these places even though I have clicked that I HAVE been to said places. The lists is kind of the whole reason I downloaded this app. It will only allow you to sign up using a Facebook or Google sign-in. If you don't have one of those, or don't want to use one, then tough luck! Probably uninstall..",

Used to have a perfect integration with both Navigon and Sygic Truck navigations. Sadly, it has been removed from Sygic Truck lately, making my life much harder, as I depend on pois due to my job. Amazing app, 6 stars if possible!!!",
            "I have been using the app for more than 2 years. I wish the visuals were updated and screens became more intuitive. For example I cannot access my menu when browsing, I have to go back to the home screen. Also there is a bug if you want to upload a photo of a cafe. I have a feeling the app was never touched/improved since 2 years."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.üôèüôè",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

I have tried lots of launchers instead, yet I didn't experience the 'smooth' one. Your great app really follows your slogan \"smooth\", and you also fix the bugs that others was annoyed based on their comment.",
            "The newest update made it where the app is literally unusable. It crashes each time I try to make it my default homepage. I tried restarting my phone and it still won't open. Please fix this!!",
            "CRASH CRASH AND CRASH AGAIN! ü§¨ I've had this app for a long while now. Used to work great. Now every damn minute or so I get the annoying app keeps closing alert. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it and even wondered my other apps maybe interfering & causing it to crash. But then I thought \"I wonder if anyone else is having the same problem\" so I come on the play store, look at the reviews and big surprise its happening to everyone. THEY NEED TO UPDATE THEIR LAST \"UPDATE\"! VOILA.",
            "A very good app. Everything is simple and clear. Makes it without any confusion. I have used other launcher hola launcher very similar to solo launcher for many years it was my favourite but now not existing ; better in that range one and only is the Solo launcher. But now it is crashing in REDMI NOTE 9 pro max. And Samsung also. Need to sort it out immediately. Originally I rated five Star. But continuous crashes it is down rated.",
            "It just won't stop crashing I had a layout that i loved and now its all gone because I can't use the app after the \"update\""

            "Mobile check deposit feature seems to have a bug, where it doesn't read the camera's orientation correctly after the first picture taken. It looks like the image is getting rotated again, so it's really squashed and not at the correct aspect ratio. You have to take the other picture manually, as the automatic feature doesn't really work when it gets into this state.",
            "I was loving this app for depositing check, since my company doesn't have direct deposit. But lately, after I take the photo of one side of the check, I can't get a photo of the other side, because the app wants to take the photo in a long skinny \"letterbox\" format. It's quicker to get in the car and drive to an ATM than it is to get this to work. It makes the app useless to me.",
            "This app just sucks. Rarely do I get the notifications that I set up in the app for alerts and if I do get them it's not until several hours later. Sometimes the app will open itself back up after I've already checked it and closed it out. Very frustrating to use. I've had several other banking apps and none have given me the problems BoA does. May be time for a new bank but until then my review of this app stays the same.",
            "This App is wonderful and allows me to have a full banking experience. It even includes a chat feature which guides you through different topics of questions or concerns you have. It's very convenient that you can request a call from Customer service in the App so that you have zero wait time on hold and you generally receive a call within 5 minutes Max.",
            "Terrible check capture. Clearly now a bug where you can only capture one side of a check. All subsequent attempts shows a skewed camera view and nonsensical pop-ups that renders it impossible. Only solution is to close and reopen the app, but you still can't capture both sides. Great timing when people don't want to visit branches in person. No QC at all during the pandemic?"

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. üòÇ The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. üòÇ",

            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

If I want to start watching prime time etc from the beginning, I have to go alllll the way back through all the episodes.. When catching up on nxt i have to close my eyes while scrolling through all the epispdoes (in reverse) to avoid spoilers. Also open up the vaults already! More coliseum videos, and other old footage you have possesion of.. No one cares if its not in HD we just want to see it.. Crockey Cup 1987 !!",
            "Love WWE Network! I can watch anything from WWF/WWE, WCW, ECW, NWA, all the territories, etc. It is so amazing! Also love all the original WWE shows exclusive to the app. If you love wrestling like I do I can't imagine my life without this app in it. I watch it everyday. For example I just binged every WWE Monday Night Raw from 1998 and just started 1999 season! UNREAL!!!",
            "Could be a lot better, I was still getting ads even though I'm a subscriber, I can't listen to shows in the background as if you leave the app it pauses the video you where watching the app needs significant improvements because of how much it's missing when compared to other streaming services",
            "I love the network..ive never had a problem with it and have been a member since 2014..how come its not letting me go on it. Ive refreshed a bunch of times and have gotten the same results which has been just lag and errors. Please help a loyal fan and customer out. Thanks",
            "Horrible. The ap will not allow me to choose Bell as my subscription option. There fore I cannot watch anything live on my phone. I use Google Chrome and still I get a 400 error message when I click on Bell. Very frustrated and unhappy"

            "Overall a killer app. Have not found very many artist that are not available, including full albums and discography. This has been my go to app for anything music related! I would like to see a feature that allows only the actual artists to come up in a search instead of covers, clips, and demos. Not very many complaints overall. Keep up the great work, particularly on Android based phones!",
            "I use to use this app all the time to download music to my phone. Use to work great but now it sucks. I tried uninstalling the app and redownloading it to see if that would help but still can't find any music I'm looking. This app needs fixed or it will be permanently removed from my phone",
            "It sometimes gets stuck on one song, so I need to reset the whole app, reload my playlist so I can continue to listen to my music. Outside of that, it's a good app.",
            "This app was good in the beginning but niw it just makes me beyond sad I cant fins any of the latest kpop songs on here. Please fix it, this app was so reliable at one stage, it was my goto music dowloading place now I have to try 4 different apps just to get the songs I want.",
            "I've had this app for years and downloaded many songs without a problem... but now for the last few weeks I can't download anything. This app now sucks!"
