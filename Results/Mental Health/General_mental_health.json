            "Was diagnosed by a mental health professional before & this apps tests results were right on which, for such complicated issues, was very surprising. It's a great start for someone who is wanting to know these things",
            "I like how every area of this app is straight forward; even the questionnaire is direct and effective. There are SEVERAL DIFFERENT topics to êxplore! The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",
            "I have shared it with friends already. It's great. Retake tests compare the results to each one. Keeps a journal. Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

All of our therapists have a degree (at least a master’s, some a PhD) and specialty: psychologists (PsyD/PhD), licensed professional counselors (LPC), clinical social workers (LCSW/LMSW) and marriage and family therapists (MFT).

While experience and expertise vary, you are guaranteed to find a match.

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration.

            "I love this app, it helps to guide you and gives you ideas and things to think about Update: 10/12/2020 I loved this app at the beginning. Then the question of the day stopped changing. It has been stuck on my 3 personal qualities. I stopped using the app for a while and recently got back into it and it is still asking that same question. It is irritating to me.",
            "I like it but there's a couple of bugs with the app. When I'm typing my journal entry, I scroll back up or down to fix a typo and it will take me to the next step (listing victories of the day). One time it did that and it erased everything that I typed. when I select a logged mood/activity, it pulls up the screen for the day. It will say \"no logs.\" I can only view the moods by viewing by week, or viewing a day after the actual day of the mood. For example, a mood on Aug 31 will show on Sept 1",
            "Love this so far, it very much helps to track your mood. Also it makes you think several times about the worst things in your life so that you can make sure they have some positive impact, even the smallest bit. I will be working with this app for more and I hope after some time I would be able to notice some changes in myself!",
            "So far so good. I will review after I've used it longer. Only 2 days so far but I very much like the way it is laid out - one has to stop and really think about one's self and why one feels, thinks, reacts or emotes in certain ways. I would like to know how to go back and look at my past stories. So frustrating!!!",
            "This app is incredible I love the feeling of opening this app and expressing my feeling and how my day went its like you have someone to talk to its amazing I would really recommend this app, I use this every day and wouldnt turn to a different journaling experience."

            "As a mental health clinician I wanted to trial it before recommending. Found the UI delightful, however, unfortunately I think this requires a higher degree of functioning than I'd hoped. Example, holding your breath. no indication when to exhale when being 'teleported' sounds silly I know but some need those correct prompts. Update UI with more information in each area addressing functionality would be well received. Lots of areas didn't work at all such as music, really buggy. Samsung S20",
            "Overall, the app is great. It makes you think about deeper questions in life. One thing that I found problematic, and hence deducted 2 stars is that the app keeps crashing for some reason. I'll be in the middle of writing my journal and it'll crash. Although, the journal entry is usually saved automatically before the crash, it's really frustrating. Please look into this. Other than that, its a really fun and engaging app. Thank you.",
            "This is a wonderful app and I feel lucky to have seen the reddit post by the creator, its a blessing. You can feel the care that went into making it, just the fact it doesn't have ads or ask for money makes it 100X better than any other. But what's really amazing is how much it helps, even when there isn't anything wrong it's incredibly calming, I love the new nature sounds section.",

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

I'm getting premium for sure.",

            "It's beautifully designed and the ideas are good, but it rewards things that shouldn't always be rewarded, like productivity, for instance, because that's something we guilt ourselves for a lot. It's also extremely repetitive and there seems to be no variance, which makes it seem outdated and of limited use.",

What you do know is that you want to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSo where do you begin?\r\n\r\nEnter the world of MoodSpace\r\nMoodSpace brings together techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, positive psychology, and behavioural activation into a self-help space for mental wellbeing to guide you in managing and improving your mental health.\r\nTechniques such as recognising three good things in a gratitude journal and balancing automatic thoughts in the cbt thought record are grounded in decades of research on what makes us happy.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds \r\nNotice life's good moments by writing a delightful three good things in a gratitude journal and note the good things that are all too often forgotten.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds is based on the gratitude journal from Positive Psychotherapy. By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.\r\n\r\nThought Diary \r\nLook at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.\r\n\r\nThe thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.\r\n\r\nGuided Meditation\r\nFocus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds.

Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced. I try to fill the three clouds when I remember, but I'm not yet regular with it. The Thought Diary function was immensely helpful in a difficult situation. Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",

It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking. Meditations are ok.",

Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them.

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

When marking \"Yes\" to all phobias, I got the result \"Gephysrophobia\" which is wrong. Marked fear of 2 - 5 qualifying phobic situations is known as Agoraphobia 300.22 (F40.00).

Refreshing, and grateful that I stumbled across TalkLife. Keep it secret, keep it safe. ;)",

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!!

For example if I just finished composing a music piece, I should be able to get a reward for it (like eating my fav ice cream or something), so that people get an inspiration to work. Thank you",
            "The app says it's for self care but tbh it can be used to track any activity you'd like. It even lets you make notes about your progress. The only reason I have not rated it a full 5 is because I was expecting to see my progress for individual tasks, like for eg, I'd like to see in the calender only the days I exercised. But it shows all the tasks clubbed in one single calender so you have to go to different dates to see if you did a particular activity.",

It has made me realize patterns in my life that lead to more contentment and peace. It has alsoade me realize that things I thought really filled me up actually don't. Other, simpler things, are really what I need. I'm so happy I found this app.",
            "Loving this app so far! It's very minimalistic and it works really well. It can also be used for other things to track aside from self-care. Just bought Sparkle Plus and it's definitely worth it (and really cheap too)!",

        "description": "Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\r\n\r\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\r\n \r\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\r\n\r\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\r\n\r\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\r\n\r\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety.

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "Selected breathing as my daily activity and it does not show up on my dashboard... I see great potential for this app, just not there yet. Or at least it did not work for me unfortunately.",
            "Overall pretty good, UI is a bit clunky in places but the feature set is fine. The pro features look neat, however £9.99 a month for a logging app is WAY too much",
            "It's been eye opening to track my mood and the things I'm grateful for. This seems to be helping me stay focused on the positive, which in turn improves my mood.",
            "Thank You for putting this app together, I'm finding it concise, user friendly and helpful. I have no negative feedback but thought it might be helpful to let you know my favourite features so far; 1. I've really connected with the little statements that pop up each time I log on. They're helpful reminders and feel like a friendly voice cheering me on. 2. Love the easy 🙂 for mood description and the tab options. It means in those moments you can't find the words or are just tired, you can simply choose a word. 3. I'm also getting alot from the articles you email me. As well as quality content, they're short so easy to take in and daily so I'm not overwhelmed with info. To sum up, really impressed with this app and finding it easy to include it in my day, so confident I can keep it going when I'm back at work again. Great job Team, thanks! 👍👏",
            "I've been using Moodfit for about 6 months and highly recommend it. It's a valuable tool in helping me manage my anxiety. I like being able to create my own shortcuts and goals and regularly use the gratitude, grounding and breathing tools. It can be buggy, but for a free app with no ads, I'm not complaining, and the customer service is great: quick, friendly and effective."

I'm just going to cancel my membership - instead of Talkspace helping me with anything it's become another source of frustration in my life. Freakin' worthless.",
            "I submitted a question to customer support 11 days ago and have not gotten a response yet. I want to cancel my account, but there is no button to cancel or deactivate. This app is terrible. The texting feature is one of the major reasons I signed up for Talkspace, but I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth since my therapist does not respond for 8-12 hours. When she does respond, she just says she has some ideas that could help me, but that she will share them during our next session, making me wait several days for any sort of lifeline! I need help now! I'm paying for this service! On another similar therapy app, I was able to message back and forth with my therapist and get instant feedback. As for the video chats, I would have preferred if my therapist would have been stationed in one place the whole time instead of walking around her house. It was a bit unprofessional and even when she was sitting down because she had a tv on somewhere in the house and she was moving the camera all around making me sea sick. To make matters worse, I had no way of knowing if anyone at her house could hear our conversation! She had a lot of experience as a therapist, but admitted that she was new to Talkspace and had not yet read all of the handbook and all the rules she was supposed to follow as a provider. When we got booted out of our video call three times, she suggested that we FaceTime. Again, not professional! Talkspace is a secure platform where mental health information can be shared. FaceTime is not! I'm going back to the other app I was using before. It was slightly more expensive, but wayyyy better!",
            "Do not waste your time or money with this app. My therapist has been really wonderful and responsive, but the app is absolute trash. I reached out to support and the only response I received was, \"We've received your support request, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" That's it. No actual response to my concern. I can't book new sessions because I \"don't have any session credits available\" and there's no obvious/visible way for me to even pay to book another session. To top it off, the sessions that I have booked with my therapist have been such poor quality that I am literally talking to a blank screen because her face never shows up, despite us both having very fast internet connection speeds. I'm really disappointed in the general usability of the app, the complete lack of customer service, and the quality of the calls between me and my therapist.",
            "The issue has been resolved. Thank you! I was charged a total of 8 times in one month and still have not heard back from customer service or been issued a refund. On top of that, the app is still behaving as if i haven't renewed my subscription despite having taken 8 monthly charges out. If customer service ever reaches out and resolves the issue then I will change my rating because I love my therapist, but I dont like being multi-charged for a service I am not receiving.",
            "Received an invite link to this service. The first therapist told us they could not accommodate video sessions, which is what we paid for. The second therapist did not respond to any messages. Talkspace seems unable or unwilling to provide the service we paid for."

At the same time, BPD is one of the most stigmatized, misunderstood, and least talked about psychiatric disorders. For many years it was believed that BPD only affected young women. However, we now know that both men and women of all ages are affected with BPD. What makes BPD such a devastating disorder is the high rate of self-injury and suicidal behavior associated with it.

The role of an MHN has gradually transitioned over the years, to encompass a greater level of involvement in patient care e.g. nurses now have authority to prescribe medication.[5] The main responsibilities of a MHN can be subdivided into six broad categories with a certain degree of overlap:[6]\r\n\r\nCase management: This consists of tailoring care to the specific needs of an individual. It involves providing interventions in the form of psychotherapy or familial support; arranging other services when required; establishing networks with community agencies; overseeing changes in medication; community integration and actively seeking out people who drop out of services.\r\nPsychosocial interventions: A holistic approach to patient care is required, by which the MHN should build rapport with patients to encourage trust, while listening to and interpreting their needs and concerns. If a patient is having social/financial problems, the MHN may offer advice and interventions e.g. by arranging social events in the community, in order to develop patients’ socials skills and combat feelings of isolation. They may also work with patients' families and carers, helping to educate them about the burden of mental illness.\r\nPhysical health: Long-term mental illness sufferers may have substantial cardiometabolic/ respiratory illnesses.[7][8] Furthermore, this population is at considerable risk of contracting infections, such as HIV and AIDS.[9] The MHN will prepare and maintain comprehensive patient records, whilst also producing care plans and risk assessments. They must also monitor weight, blood pressure and provide health education and interventions in areas such as diet, smoking and sexual behaviour.\r\nMedication management: MHN must ensure correct administration of medication, including injections, and monitoring the results of treatment.[2]\r\nWorking with dual diagnosis patients, and promoting a 'recovery' based approach to care.\r\nBehavioural therapy: Providing evidence- based individual therapy e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety.

Woebot really helps you through things when you need help. Also, there are no ads and no in-app purchases, it's crazy awesome. I tell all my friends who I think would benefit from having this app, because I've found it very helpful. 10/10 app, thank you so much!!",
            "This app is extremely helpful. A little robot, an anonymous person, to tell my worries to. The gratitude journal is super helpful too, I can look back on what's gone well. The lessons it provides are really helpful too. Sometimes, I open the app with just the intention of checking in my mood for the tracker, and i end up spending half an hour doing a lesson! They're always super helpful and make me feel better. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
            "Came across this through work and during lock down. I have not noticed anything negative about it, performance wise. Overall it's a useful well being tool to help check in with yourself and offers some useful prompts and insights about impactful things on a person's mood. You seem to be able to converse with it when you have a spare few mins. Fairly easy to 'forget' it's A.I . you are conversing with.",
            "The AI for Woebot sometimes misses what I am saying, but overall this app gives daily lessons on helpful thought patterns and tools. While not a replacement for therapy, it provides additional tools my therapist had not included as well as reinforcement of some of the tools I was already taught. I encourage other folks to try Woebot as a supplement to their self care routines and therapy.",
            "I found the app very comforting and helpful during a stressful period. I'm familiar with CBT but it was still useful to be reminded of those skills. And although you know it's not a real person talking to you, knowing that a real person wrote the text originally is comforting, and shows that someone cares."

            "This app has been really helpful in the mornings for me. It gives me a positive affirmation/reminder for the day. Its interesting to go through a negative belief that you may have and that it makes you challenge that negative thought with a positive one. Dear developers: I think a search bar or something similar could be very helpful! A way to type in the specific feeling or thought you're having and being able to get relating affirmations from the keywords that you enter in. :)",
            "Unlike most of the mental health/CBT apps out there, this one actually has content (more than just \"Describe the thought and bodily sensation, then come up with a positive response\"). If you want some constructive reframing without the cutesy cartoon animals, Thinkladder's got you. Only way to make it better would be more content (but you guys are still working on that update, right?) Thanks for a great app!",
            "If only it would continue the content where it was left it would be perfect.(when pressing back bottom)",
            "Insights for one of the options are just...not there. It's a blank page. Not a very promising introduction to using the app.",
            "This app is invaluable to help you examine negative self thoughts, feelings & perspectives & replace them with helpful ones.Unlike other self-help apps - which require you to generate your own positive alternatives - it provides the positive alternatives for you. This is why I feel the app is invaluable: if you are entrenched in negative thoughts & feelings about your self, it can feel impossible to generate a helpful, alternative thought for your self. I'm grateful to all that devised this app."

            "Bit rubbish really, Anxiety is new and I'm struggling terribly. I'm trying to figure out triggers and I find writing a daily log helps. But! This app has no tracker or graph as standard, they want you to pay. Even samsung health comes with free tracker for steps etc. I need a visual to help me assess and so this app and every other Anxiety app I've tried fail as nobody does the tracker for free.",
            "On first glance this looks like the app I want, and I look forward to the full export abilities, per someone else's review. Two things: I'd love to be able to set multiple reminders per day, and I while I can't afford a subscription, I would pay a one-time payment to get rid of ads.",
            "I definitely plan to get the premium version of this, within hopes that when I do get a therapist, that this app can help see what goes on daily.",

            "I feel like this is a really good app, gives me a little bit of responsibility by waking up my buddy and gets me to go out and do simple but meaningful tasks. It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

It appears that the developers took what used to be free and instead of adding \"more\" for members they just restricted what was free. Very disappointed."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "There is nothing more I could want in a mood tracker. It is completely customizable, data-focused, and most importantly the app doesn't stress me out. I didn't even realize until now how other apps were designed to frustrate you with constant notifications, reminders, sudden ads, and odd paywalls until you give up or pay up. This is the first time I've been able to stick with mood tracking for more than a week.",
            "This app is simple but does it well. I personally don't like that you can't save your data automatically, but I respect the reasoning behind it, and other, similar apps I have tried do the same. I LOVE how they handle ads. The fact that they are optional, and only offered when you had a good day is so pleasant. They probably don't profit off of it as much, but it's so respectful I can't help but watch the ads every time",
            "I initially downloaded and used the app to track my mood so that I had something to reference when talking to doctors. That was almost 2 years ago and I still take a moment every night to reflect on my day. The free version was everything I need, but I make a habit to try and pay for apps without predatory payment options so I upgraded to the plus. If you want something simple to track how you've felt day to day, this is an excellent simple application to do just that.",
            "I've been using this app for over a year now, and as someone with PTSD, it has helped track my progress, track and manage patterns in my mental health, and has provided a daily reminder to reflect for a moment on how I'm doing today. When I downloaded it, I didn't think it would become such an integrated and important part of my daily life, but it has! I love this app.",
            "PIN doesn't work anymore. I made a back up to transfer to another phone, it made back up of the saved ones but it did not make a back up of the emotions I added before. There were lots but now the ones I added are all gone. :( I loved this app but it seems like it doesn't get updated anymore and felt like the creator doesn't care about this app anymore. :( searching for a better one now. It was great, but now it's not. Another 2020 low. :("

        "comments": [
            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

It's nice because you can switch between counsellors if you're not feeling satisfied and there are in the counselling section some guided exercises and articles for several purposes. Note that the price differs between therapy and program, being in this way affordable for more people."

            "I really have been enjoying the SHINE App. This is my first year of using SHINE. The subscription prices are reasonable and I would advocate for it if you like the free dailey morning audio meditations and readings, I love it that it has audio meditations, check-ins, a calendar to track progress, noon and bedtime meditations, and a library However, I would appreciate the ability to use the same subscription for the Android and iPhone so that progress can be synched between devices. Thank you.",
            "I'm in love with this app for so many reasons. I love the gentle nudges that keep me coming back, the enormous amount of support I feel with being given options to journal or talk it out, and most importantly that the voices I hear are from BIPOC.",
            "I try to use this app every morning to start the day. It has a variety of deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, positive affirmations, and much more. They tailor to your needs based on the questionnaire given at the beginning. I'm enjoying this app so far!",
            "This is a great app for supporting mental health and the challenges we face in modern life. It is my go to app for stress and anxiety relief. The fact that it exists lets me know I am not alone, I am part of a community of people who experience the world as it is and are working to make it live up to its promise. Thank you Shine!",
            "I like what I see in the free version even though most features are locked for premium. Unfortunately I will be uninstalling because at $54 a year it's a little expensive for me but I am sure it would be worth it. Great app overall."

This valuable new tool provides inspiring stories to help you reach the finish line each day, and whether you prefer to read or listen - daily coaching is a great way to kickstart your day with inspiration.",
        "comments": [
            "It's a good app, but the alarms aren't as customizable as I'd like, and some of the elements are a little confusing. It took me way too long to figure out how to delete and reorder things, it's not as intuitive as HabitRPG. That being said, it's nice to have a community to participate with- or not. Either way is acceptable, and no feeling left out or pushed in. Useful tool for helping serious change, one day at a time.",
            "This app is amazing, but geared heavily towards women. As a person trying to build a more masculine frame and personality using this app seems a little bit counterproductive to my goals. In my opinion, this app would receive a 5-star rating and high praise if it were gender-neutral. Over all, a very good app. Clean interface, detailed, motivatinf, and easy to use.",
            "It's a really sleek and informative app. I'm just on the trial bit so far so good :-) I wanted to add - after two years of using this app, I am finally beginning to live the life I know I deserve and have worked so hard to achieve. The Fabulous has been an invaluable tool in helping me stay focused and achieve goals one step at a time. Thank you so much ❤️",
            "This app has given me space to do something just for me, which as a new mom can be tricky! I really like the journeys and goals and habits, but I find that the interface isn't super user friendly and I often find features by accident and then have no idea how to get back to them. Maybe I need to play around more, but it would be nice if there were less hidden nooks and crannies, so to speak. Overall, love it and am so thankful for it!",
            "I uninstalled this app from my phone recently, then found that I had paif £45.99 for a year's premium at 50% discount. I have no recollection of this....... but no proof either. I've just cancelled all pre-approved payments on Paypal to avoid anything like that happening again. In the meantime, I've got use of the app for another 12 months and so might as well use it. It's not worked brilliantly for me - it's basically a habit tracker."

I have learnt about myself already.. Thank you for a great app..",
            "I haven't yet played it much, so cannot give it full marks. Will review again at a later date. So far though, graphics, game play, speed, storyline, etc are all good. It even gives you psychology tips and assessment information on your profile. It'd be good to see what I make of it once I search up all the terms they have mentioned.",
            "It's a good app to explore what the big five personality types are but I do not think it's a good representation of what your big five results actually are. The testing is from a multiple choice storyline where some of the answers are in a right/wrong format. It also claimed to be based from clinical research, which in turn does not make it good or bad",
            "Good idea, poor execution. The writing needs a lot of work. Most of the answers are ridiculous, and some of the \"right answers\" seem socially inept -- which works against the whole point of this game. For example, why would you need to tell a suspect that you're not the \"best chief of security\"??? The personality test questions also lead to wrong conclusions, because they're not based on what you would choose in real life, but what you think the character you're playing as should choose.",
            "I appreciate the art style and how the education is not too text book. It seems culturally relevant and easy to follow. The lessons are easy to understand and I appreciate the practice that comes after. Immersive experience of trying to get it right using the tools learned is really cool."

            "I absolutely would recommend this to anyone and everyone. If you are like me and struggle to deal with anxiety, depression, self identity, stress, self esteem, etc. you should download this app. I thought it was silly at first, but after a while I noticed that it provided me a place to jot down my thoughts in a way that was easy to do. I suddenly noticed a great decrease in depression. This was because I was able to get all the negative thoughts out and start getting the positive in. Thank you!",
            "So i love this app but i have to big complaints. One it shows that the dream diary and vision board options are available and they are not. The other is i lost my daily writing strike for nothing. In my writings you can clearly see the dates yet it takes it away from me? Idk. I love it other then that its just aggravating",
            "Just loved the simplicity of the app. Best journalling app I have ever seen. For me, Its the world's best place to express my thoughts and emotions. Its analytic feature is amazing. Thank you : The Zone.. for giving such amazing service.",
            "Great app, a lot of thought has been put into it. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to get better at being able to control your Attitude/Mood/Emotions. ●Edit: I have not been able to journal anything down for a handful of days, everytime I'm in the loading phase, it automatically force closes the app.",
            "This app just blew me away. I rarely rate/review apps, but this was way too well deserved to ignore. The UI, the writing prompts, the emotion cards, the creative passion put forth in the making of this app is very much so obvious after 5 minutes of working with it -I completely forgot I was using a self-care type of app. THEN, you went ahead and slapped the \"analytics\" portion on me like a cherry on a sundae! Idk you, but I'm so grateful for you. Thank you DEVs! -Madelyn"

            "I have the diagnose but the questionnaire results said I don't which is srsly bad if someone has it and takes this test they will think all is good and maybe not seek help for it in time. I have type 2 which is more hard to detect and the app just copied the most common questionnaire for screening but usually theese questions are combined with more screenings to further evaluate if you have it not so all in all this app is misguiding for ppl who don't know this.",
            "Hi, taking this 'test' as a person professionally diagnosed with bipolar one. First I wanna say that it only dives into mania/hypomania, which would not be as useful to my friends with type two. Its also quite lazy, and directly copies questions used to determine if screeming is nessacary. If you're taking it for fun go fornit I guess, but talk to a professional if you're having concerns.",

            "Easy to use; accessible and very blind friendly; thank you. It's getting very hard to find an app that isn't overloaded with unlabeled images, buttons, and circular sliders. Thanks for a straight-from-the-hip, getter-done meditation app. You're welcome. I'm really grateful that the reminders are verbal as well. Most apps seem to think that visual reminders are enough, but blind people don't have the luxury of looking at their phones constantly, so thanks for talking to me.",
            "An excellent, totally free mindfulness app. Smiling Mind covers everything from children to teenagers to adult mindfulness foundations, with a variety of specific targeted mindfulness courses of all sorts to help with different areas like sleep, stress, relationships, work - etc. I've been using it for years and it's wonderfully ad free. As for mindfulness itself, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're curious, Smiling Mind is a perfect place to start.",
            "This app is so great when it works. It gets quite glitchy when it comes to member login and member data. It will not let me reset my password because apparently my email address is not present in the system but I am unable to register a new email address because I'm already registered in the system! When I was still able to login it would randomly delete my data and programs/progress. It will also sometimes just freeze in the middle of a meditation.",
            "I like the meditations however I dont like the layout and navigation of the app. A lot of the meditations are too similar, cant skip and have a long intro that I dont want to hear every time. The app logs me out often too and I have to login, which is an annoying inconvenience when I'm trying to relax to sleep. I fell asleep to it and it kept playing the whole night for 8 hours. And just then I was listening and it kept skipping to the beginning. It was rather creepy actually and now I'm on edge",
            "This app is amazing and has helped me to sleep again. I was relying on a number of medications to sleep but the guided mediations have drastically changed that for me. I cannot thank everyone involved in this enough, so I'm going to donate as well. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful tool freely available and without ads, it really has changed my life 😘"

            "I really really like this app, DBT saved my life -- I still have much to improve upon. Practicing DBT on a daily basis has helped me to regain control of my emotions and allows me to stay focused and determined. DBT Coach is outstanding as a stand alone app, but for me personally it provides an effective substitution for a therapist during this transtion until I am able to afford individual sessions again.",
            "For $11.99 a month the app keeps crashing when certain lessons are opened. So you're paying for an app the only some content works. It's a shame because if it worked properly it would be worth it.",
            "The app is WAY overpriced. I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills. So I have used this app for two weeks and now cannot access/use the data accurately for my appointment tomorrow. If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",
            "I see potential. Needs better design and pricing. Will continue to use it to see how far I can go with free version. Also, needs someone to refresh the writing for a general audience. The video tour doesn't seem to work on my phone. Design is not intuitive. I had to figure it out by clicking around.",
            "Like the app, but it doesn't save your entry more times than not. Very frustrating."

It's a very pleasing app to use, the ui looks very elegant and it actually feels like Chiku is asking me questions rather than me just ranting onto the paper. The o ly complaints I have are that it's going to be a massive pain to scroll to old stories and I feel as though the daily reads (for me) aren't too useful. Really great app! I'm considering buying the lifetime plan hoping this app doesn't get discontinued.",
            "Very nice app. It's more than an app. It's a safe space🌌. Meditation is very nice. The quotes are very good of course!! Im in love with this app. The themes are all so good. Writing here is so easy!! Love it.",
            "Easiest app to use. It is enough options to declare all your feelings and mood conditions, also, if you want you can add a written description about what's going on.",
            "This app is amazing. I love how it reminds you to add a new story every day. Idk how to explain but everything is perfect.",
            "I'd like to visit my previous entries with more ease. Please let me view them more easily without having to scroll sideways a lot. Also a go-to feature where you can find specific entries besides the filter would help. Also it would be nice to be able to save community blogs and daily quotes that inspired you. Maybe save them somewhere so you can access them any time. I also have experienced difficulty downloading the pdf versions of my entries."

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think £50 for 30 minutes and £100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like £49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. £99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for £70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

The problem the past week has been I cant get the UP!Buddy app to even open, let alone show me the mood calendar and that is very important right now due to my buddy being on suicide watch... Please fix ASAP or this is going to be a useless app that we paid for.",

            "This has been a great app, it's especially useful when you're having an anxiety attack and you can't help yourself or have anyone to go to. Even if things escalate (suicidal ideation, self-harm etc) it still provides help and resources.",
            "I have a VERY HIGH stress level.This app helps with calming my anxiety,looking at things in a more positive light,and is just THE BEST all around app that is FREE and HELPFUL.TRY IT-you'll love it,too!!!",
            "De-stress Me is a mental well-being app based on cognitive-behavioral (CBT) techniques. I am currently a graduate student in psychology, and as such, I used this app with a discerning eye. The first time I opened the app I was greeted by a rather minimal interface with several options on the bottom of the screen, and a big de-stressMe button in the center. The options along the bottom allow you to input information including your strengths, ways to give thanks, and self-care ideas. The information that you input is used when you activate the de-stressing tool. One of the primary components of CBT is cognitive restructuring which entails challenging negative and automatic thoughts. The app cleverly integrates the information that you input into the bottom menus in order to assist you in challenging negatively oriented thoughts that you may experience during times of stress. Additionally, the app may suggest a technique that I am familiar with from my training, diaphragmatic breathing. The app does a good job of teaching and applying the basic tenants of both strategies. Overall, the app was helpful in reducing my stress and is based on sound psychological principles. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to reduce stress in their life.",

        "description": "Depression is an extreme low mood that lasts a long time and makes a person feel sad,\r\nirritable or empty. Many people, including many teens, have suffered in this way. A\r\ndepressed person:\r\n^ has much less energy to do activities\r\n^ feels like nothing matters.\r\n^ sees life in a negative way.\r\n^ feels like it will never get better\r\nBut depressed people do get better and depression does end. There are effective\r\ntreatments and self-help skills to deal with depression. Health care professionals give\r\ndepression treatments, but you can learn self help skills and apply them to your own life. This guide teaches a set of antidepressant skills you can use to overcome depression. Sometimes the skills can be used on their own, when the depression\r\nisn’t too severe. Sometimes they have to be used along with treatments by professionals.\r\nDealing with Depression is meant for those who have been coping with depressed mood. Some of the things in this guide will make more sense to younger teens and some will make more sense to older ones. But check it out for yourself. Decide which parts of this guide make sense for your life.\r\nThis Depression Test is designed to help you evaluate the severity of your depression with just nine simple questions. This app uses the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), an empirically-based, self-test questionnaire. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health.\r\n DISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression. Remember that this app should not be used as a replacement for professional treatment or guidance.\r\nDo you suffer from depression? Depression may stem from a personal tragedy or from sad unexpected events or circumstances. It does not discriminate its victims. Depression can affect anyone regardless of their background, race, age, income, etc.\r\nThe natural management of depression involves understanding depression and the factors that contribute to the symptoms. Learning to manage stress in your life and engage in self-care behaviors can improve your symptoms and your mood.\r\nDepression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. \r\nThis app is designed to help with Depression treatment and controlling stress by advising mood enhancing foods, teaching the importance of writing wellness journals and how to get adequate sleep during depressive episodes.\r\nDealing with Depression app is an app that helps you diagnose the level of depression you have, and based on that it gives you the suitable solution for your depression level, in some cases depression is only a result of anxiety and some passing problems, but if the person did not get out of that condition then his condition might advance, we will give you some ways to avoid the advancement of your situation, if the depression is severe we will guide you to what to do as soon as possible\r\nDepression is common but many people don't admit to it.

        "description": "There is something in all of us that responds involuntarily to different stressors and the complexity of life which is suggested be the fundamental problem of all mental illnesses. It grows and thrives as a consequence, goes beyond tolerance, making our lives miserable. Lives are complicated and we cannot stay on top of our problems all the time. People are just being hammered in many ways and that lead to their collapse in the direction of their genetic susceptibility and biological weakness.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app is developed as a tool for introspection and will provide you with evidence-based information about emotional problems and mental disorders. It will teach you cognitive behavioural therapy and other self-help methods, and techniques, specifically designed to help with overcoming depression, generalized anxiety and worry, social anxiety and shyness, divorce and separation, loss and bereavement. It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking. Cognitive behavioural therapy is proven to be effective in the long term by applying the techniques and shift the way you think. It can help you find a meaning and purpose, negotiate with yourself and be free from your past. \r\n\r\n“Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind;\r\nFor the soul is dyed by the thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Depression section, you will learn more about psychological, medical and alternative treatments for relief, reduction, prevention and dealing with major depressive disorders, dysthymia, bipolar disorder. By using the self-help methods you can learn helpful ways of thinking, that will help overcome depression now and in the future. It will also help you to practice ways of living your life and relating to people that leave you less vulnerable to depression.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Anxiety and Worry (GAD) section you will have the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and worry and whether you are a worrier. A helpful set of strategies will show you how to deal with the purpose, meaning, and content of your worries. And, at the end, you will have a different perspective on how to manage it. The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you'll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief. Although it's not possible to turn back the clock or remove the fact of a loss, you may find some of these ideas are useful for helping with your grief.\r\n\r\n*The app is not designed to treat clinical levels of depression or anxiety, or other mental health disorders. Further counseling is needed as the diagnosis and treatment require a medical practitioner or a qualified mental health professional.",

Can't fix the streak counter if it somehow misses a day, which is one of the glitches. Also, the narrator doesn't know what landscape means, he keeps saying landscape when he means portrait. App is decidedly meh and doesn't offer anything unique or special. Wouldn't purchase, only free trial. Edit: I've done the foundations course and laser focus course - both repeat about 8 exercises for 4 weeks"

            "This app is quiet helpful. At first when I tried the app I wasnt taking it seriously but when I opened up to it to see if it would help it has helped me a bit. I have really bad anxiety, generalized/health anxiety and majority of the time I forget to get on the app but when I do I feel more relieved and have my thoughts more collected than out of control all over the place. I dont pay the app for special exercises or anything and it good.",
            "They say the free version has several exercises, but when I entered my mood info, a message said, 'you aren't having negative thoughts so try one of our many activities.' But ALL activities were locked. And ALL 'Guides' were locked. There were no exercises for me to use. How can I decide to go Premium if I can't try anything in the free version first? I don't like giving low ratings before contacting the developer first - but I could not find any contact info anywhere - another pet peeve.",
            "It's not accurate to say you have a choice of exercises. Unless you pay, you get one exercise, whether it's one you like or not. The exercises are nice, but this app has nothing BUT its 11 exercises, and charges as much as apps with a whole library of meditations and tools. It's enjoyable to use but they are asking a ridiculous price for so little content compared to the competitors.",
            "I got mind ease early and was gifted a full subscription! I really enjoy the full experience and It has helped me manage my anxiety really well. The calm me function is really cool and helps give you an experience tailored to what you're feeling without you having to pick it in your moment of panic which is a great feature. I hope by this time next year I will financially be able to continue my subscription because it is well worth the money imo!",
            "I was halfway through the very first pre exercise and I felt so much better. Towards the end I had a slight emotional release, which was very much needed and I am still genuinely surprised. I cannot wait to dive deeper into this app. Thank you so much for creating this, it is truly going to help a lot of people!"

On their own, these signs do not necessarily signal anything of concern, but the presence of a number of them may suggest a problem.\r\n\r\nApp Feature:\r\n\r\n- Read Offline.\r\n- Will update more tips and content in the future.\r\n- will adding tips and audio content, video for make you easier learning.\r\n\r\nRead more here about Mental health issues:\r\n\r\nSigns of mental health issues can be put into six categories.\r\n\r\n• Thinking\r\n• Feeling\r\n• Social\r\n• Functioning\r\n• Problems at home\r\n• Poor self-care\r\n\r\nProblems with thinking include concentration, memory, the processing of information and problem solving. Experiencing trouble concentrating on or remembering things can often be one of the signs, as can fogginess in thought patterns and losing the ability to solve problems clearly. Problems with feeling can affect appetite, sleep, decision-making and guilt. In serious mental health issues, feelings can include mood swings and irrational onset of feelings such anger or excitement.\r\n\r\nSocial signs can include difficulty in relating to and getting on with others, awkwardness around others and verbal or physical aggression. Signs of problems with functioning include quitting tasks or jobs frequently, finding it hard to get along with others in a work situation and poor concentration.\r\n\r\nSigns at home of possible mental illness may be the inability to carry out simple household chores, an inability to coexist with others in the household or not being able to keep up with housework. Signs of poor self-care show themselves in appearance, with sufferers not being able to keep up with care of appearance or cleanliness, not eating well or enough, not attending to administrative affairs such as bills or finances and paying little attention to physical health.\r\n\r\nMental health issues require proper diagnosis by a medical professional, but being able to recognize some of the signs that may detect an issue can be useful in seeking help for oneself or someone else.

This awareness will lead to the first step in organizing your mind. Also, you may be able to achieve an ideal emotional state by noting and reflecting on what made you happy and what you enjoyed in the past.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a stressful event and fell into negative emotions, try keeping a diary of those feelings and events. By putting these in the diary, it will help release you from the negative emotions and make your mind brighter and clearer. \r\nThis way, you can see the positive effects that can be obtained at the moment of writing a mood diary. And if you keep writing the diary, you may find out patterns of mental ups and downs. It will have a long-term effect of enabling you to objectively look back at yourself and your past emotional states.\r\n\r\n\r\n●Mental condition changes due to various factors\r\n\r\nMental conditions can get better or worse due to various factors such as sleep, weather, hormone balance, and events of the day. \r\nIn today's society, which is also known as a “stressed society”, anxiety and frustration can make our emotions unstable throughout our daily lives. And there are a lot of occasions and circumstances that hide and distort this annoyance and depression. Accumulating negative emotions can lead to stress, and if you don't express these emotions in some manner, you'll continue to feel stressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n●Physical and mental disorder and stress\r\n\r\nStress is a chemical phenomenon in the body, but if it becomes chronic, it can cause not only body fatigue, stiff shoulders and gastrointestinal pain, but also serious psychosis and insomnia. To prevent this situation, firstly, you must be aware of the physical effects of stress. It is necessary to observe how your heart reacts when you feel depressed/annoyed and how physical sensations change. It will be easier to understand these changes by writing a sentence about the reasons causing you stress, and noting the emotions at that time.\r\n\r\n●Visualize your mood with a diary\r\n\r\nNoting your mood in a diary is a process of extracting and visualizing your emotions, irritability, irritations, and worries that tend to accumulate in yourself. Diaries that focus on positive emotions are called \"Praise Diaries\" or \"Good Things Diaries\", and those that focus on negative emotions are called \"Stress Diaries\" or \"Anger Logs\". \r\nNoting the emotions that you felt will help you feel better and help reduce frustration in the future.

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "I like the feature, but I don't like that I cannot install the app onto my laptop. The describe section is difficult to do from the phone, especially when you have a lot to say. My particular voice to text doesn't work as well I'd like when recording, especially if I'm writing about an emotionally minded experience. I'd like the freedom to work both from my phone and my laptop. :) I know that fellow classmates have wanted the ability to print their reports as well for personal tracking, for those of us that are hands-on learners.",
            "Not What I Thought It Was. I am currently looking for a flexible DBT diary card app that allows me to add diary card entries, as needed, for each entry type, as well as hide and/or delete entries that aren't relevant to my needs. I also need to be able to go back and edit my entries, as I like, as sometimes I may forget to do a diary card for a particular day, or I'll find I simply inputted something incorrectly and didn't notice.

            "I have only been using this app for a few days and it has been very helpful. The meditations and breathing exercises are short and sweet with option sound and vibrations to help keep you on task. I am very happy with the journal as well! I like the option to pick emotion stickers for the day and answer simple questions vs freestyle (although you have 2000 characters for that too).",
            "I've been using this app for a little under a week and have been finding it pretty helpful so far. Haven't had the need to try out the panic button yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the rest of the app seems helpful. That said, I am very confused as to how I can have a \"20 day Journal streak\" when I've only had the app for about five days. It's doesn't impact the function at all, but it is a very strange glitch on the gameification side of things.",
            "I have read through the information provided and found it very useful. It is very clear and easy to understand how to use the app. Even though I haven't yet taken out their paid subscription, there are still activities you can do for free. I have found so far, this to be the best Anxiety/Panic Attack App I've come across.",
            "Absolutely love this app. Would be rad if there was a chatbot like woebot or self-education quizzes to help understand ourselves & our issues. Only thing I'd change is hiding the stuff only paid users can access. Maybe prevent accidently clicking on a premium feature by having all the free features in 1 area? Being reminded we're too poor to access features that could help us, is depressing & anxiety provoking.",
            "Had an issue signing up but the rootd IT team was quick to resolve my issue. The app is very helpful and I would certainly recommend it to others that are struggling with anxiety and panic attacks."

The therapist can use multiple therapeutic techniques (psychoeducation, gradual exposure, systematic desensitization, relaxation, distraction, acceptance and commitment, mindfulness, EMDR …) to work with their patients.\r\n\r\nIt allows for the treatment of all kinds of disorders such as anxiety (phobias, panic, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, OCD, ADHD, public speaking, exams, etc.), attention management, eating disorders, and pain management, among others.\r\n\r\nValidated by more than 25 years of scientific studies.

As a student who has juggled with demanding assignments, anxiety and new surroundings, this app has been an anchor for me. It's more than a fad, it has given me a platform to record my thoughts and feelings, and set goals and targets for self improvement. Just small steps everyday can help a person feel more confident and satisfied. Just give it a try and commit to the app.",
            "I really enjoy using the app. It's helps me put my thoughts in order and reflect. It has lots exercises that are a bit like structured journaling as well things to listen to and think about. I like that it's quite casual and friendly. Overall I've found it great for focussing and building a positive mindset.",
            "Such a fantastic app! The workouts are so quick and easy to do and since starting them I have started to feel a lot more secure in my emotional health. If you are in uni, you NEED this app it helps so much.",
            "This app is perfect for what it sets out to do. The UI is simple and easy to understand. All in all it is a lovely service. However notifications won't work. They can work for one day, but I need to reset the notifications every day after :/",
            "Love the UI, and the sessions are actually super good. It's not just a headspace alternative but so much more, especially the daily reflection sessions. A must have! Slight bug on the solo exercises but only happened once! Best of all, NO ADS!"

            "This game helped me relax with no ads or nonesense and I feel like they really do care about you, even if you don't play it. It was a tad hard to pluck the hair but it made it a lot more fun. I'd recommend this game if you like relaxing stuff, unless you hate plucking hairs. The arm and hair is fine but everything else has a bit of black on it though if i had to knock it on anything it would be that. Thank you for reading this!",
            "It's kinda weird you pull out hairs and it's about emotions. The graphic is terrible but that adds to the feeling of this app and the voice is so endearing. This whole app is endearing. It feels like your pure friend trying to cheer you up with cheesy remarks and jokes. Sorry I can't give you guys any money but keep it up. Also, no ads at all.",
            "For me its hard to find games like this and i love games that are different for popular games and games that most people know about. But this game is super cool i know it might seem like you just plucking hair but its actually a really nice game so i hope you guys enjoy it as much ad i do.",
            "I thought this game was very creative and calming to play, it was a short game, but a very enjoyable game, and i loved the voice it was very funny to hear and helped to convey what they were saying!!! I also love how there were no ads, except for maybe twice the entire game to ask me to donate, so they can continue with no ads!!! So thus game is definitely amazing!!!",
            "Game seems broken. Very first thing to do and it doesn't work. Colored point to tap appeared, tapped it, then I couldn't do anything. Couldn't pull down, couldn't pinch with two fingers like the image showed, nothing but move it to one side."

Definitely helps me out A LOT !!!! Thank you guys",

To keep on going, you need a positive but realistic attitude, aiming for excellence but realizing perfection is impossible. Try your very best, but do not let failure or shortfalls discourage you. View health and fitness as competitions against yourself, rather than against others. Always respect yourself, your pursuits, and everyone else involved. If you develop a positive attitude and environment, you will find success much easier to attain.\r\n\r\nDemonstrate Self Control\r\n\r\nWhether in your day-to-day life, or during the course of achieving something great, you will find yourself swept up in all sorts of emotions: anger, frustration, sadness, etc. Do not let these feelings get the best of you and your dreams. While you cannot help how you feel in reaction to something, you can determine how you let these emotions affect you. Always take a movement to breathe and think deeply about why you feel the way you do and whether you should let something get to you. Learn techniques like mindfulness and meditation to overcome the stress that comes with any challenging but worthy pursuit.\r\n\r\nMotivate Yourself\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep striving towards your goal, take it from the world's most accomplished athletes: you will need a lot of motivation and enthusiasm. This means being conscious of the rewards and benefits that come from sports, not just from the destination but the journey as well. You are going to hit a lot of obstacles in any endeavor, but as long as you hold onto that drive you will persevere. That is why you need to consciously motivate yourself each and every day, whether it is during training or right before the big game.\r\n\r\nKeep Your Eyes on the Prize\r\n\r\nMentally strong people can look at the long-term and the bigger picture, allowing them to overcome the doubts and failures that come your way. That means setting goals that are realistic, measurable, and offer a time frame that you can be accountable to. These objectives should be short-term and long-term, so that every day, week, month, or year you have something to keep you going. That is how the best athletes remain committed to accomplishing the constant demands of their training regimens.\r\n\r\nEmbrace Change and Let Go of the Past\r\n\r\nChange is inevitable, especially if you are trying to make a change for the better. Mental strength means adjusting to physical and emotional challenges and overcoming the stagnation of the familiar. To overcome your current challenges and aim for bigger things, you have to be willing to go into new territory while letting go of the comfortable life you are trying to change.\r\n\r\nDownload how to be mentally strong now for learn about mental health",

So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",

It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",

I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",

Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

There are two types, the NCLEX-RN and the NCLEX-PN. After graduation from a school of nursing, one takes the NCLEX exam to receive his or her nursing license. A nursing license gives an individual the permission to practice nursing, granted by the state where he or she met the requirements.\r\n\r\nMental health is a level of psychological well-being, or an absence of a mental disorder; it is the \"psychological state of someone who is functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioral adjustment\". From the perspective of positive psychology or holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life, and create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. According to World Health Organization (WHO) mental health includes \"subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others.\" WHO further states that the well-being of an individual is encompassed in the realization of their abilities, coping with normal stresses of life, productive work and contribution to their community.[4] However, cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how \"mental health\" is defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ensure public protection, each board of nursing requires a candidate for licensure to pass the appropriate NCLEX examination, NCLEX-RN for registered nurses and the NCLEX-PN for vocational or practical nurses. NCLEX examinations are designed to test the knowledge, skills and abilities essential for the safe and effective practice of nursing at the entry-level.\r\n\r\nNCLEX examinations are provided in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format and are presently administered by Pearson VUE in their network of Pearson Professional Centers (PPC). individual will be scored by their ability to think critically about decisions involving nursing care\r\n\r\nThis app is also suitable for  students, researchers, resident, doctors, Anatomy & physiology specialists, nurses and medical professionals and of course Medical lecturers, teachers and professors.\r\nGet a better score in your  USMLE  (step1, step2  CS & CK), PANCE, MCAT, DAT, COMLEX,CNA, OAT, NBDE,  or PCAT exam, and the most important  is to fall in love with the material, it worth all the attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis educational 7 medical application is intended to CNA,\r\nANP - Adult Nurse Practitioner\r\nFNP - Family Nurse Practitioner\r\nA-GNP - Adult-Gero Primary Nurse Practitioner\r\nANP-BC Adult Nurse Practitioner\r\nFNP-BC Family Nurse Practitioner\r\nPNP-BC Pediatric Nurse Practitioner\r\nACNP-BC Acute Care Nurse Practitioner\r\nGNP - BC Gerontological Nurse Practitioner\r\nPMHNP-BC Adult Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner\r\nPMHNP-BC Family Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner\r\nCNRN®\r\nSCRN®\r\nand also for USMLE, COMLEX, ANCC Certification Center,\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nTop of learning, the publisher of this android application, is not affiliated with or endorsed by any testing organization.

Someone who is beginning to show signs of or is currently suffering from a mental disorder or mental illness may have a dazed look, or lose concentration easily when carrying out regular daily activities. Granted, being able to recognize the physical symptoms of a mental patient may be difficult at first, but once one sees that their friend or family member is making such physical changes, he or she will find it gradually easier to recognize such conditions.\r\n\r\nHaving a withdrawn behavior and \"lonely\" attitude are some of the more important mental illness symptoms that need to be looked out for by family members and friends. Withdrawing from family life and social activities that had been previously enjoyed by the individual is one such symptom. It is almost always exhibited by individuals who are feeling depressed, have mood disorders, suffer from schizophrenia, social anxiety disorders, and many other types of mental illnesses.\r\n\r\nSome other common symptoms of mental illnesses are irritability and unprovoked anger. If you are living with a family member that has a mental disorder, or believe that you may be suffering from one yourself, then you may have already experienced such behavior. Someone who is suffering from a mental disorder may be easily angered, yell for no apparent reason, and appear more irritable in general.\r\n\r\nIt is important to identify and monitor the above mentioned mental illness symptoms in order to obtain good professional help. Contacting a mental health center or a psychiatrist is a great way to get help because they can prescribe various treatment options for the specific mental illness that one is suffering from. For example, prescription medications like anti-depressant medications may be required, and those medications can be combined with counseling and behavior modification therapy. In addition, mental health professionals often extend their services to family members who live with the individual suffering from a severe mental disorder. These services often include family therapy and counseling that benefits all. Multiple solutions and coping mechanisms can be shared and used through such counseling and psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, dealing with a mental illness definitely is not easy as it requires a lot of patience and perseverance. However, by using the proper treatment for the diagnosed mental disorder and seeking help from the professionals, the symptoms of these major mental illnesses can be treated effectively.

Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors.  Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person's reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person. During diagnosis a person's culture must also be taken into account. As of 2013 there is no objective test.

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

Due to several abbreviations being used, it would have been better if was recorded by a human voice than a robotic voice. It will be nice, if the study could continue from where it was last left than starting all over again and if it can be installed on computer or laptops. Otherwise the content appears to align with the book and for the price, I can't complain much but if the quality is improved, it won't hurt to pay a descent price and still enjoy a good quality material.",

            "Too buggy to use. I entered my mood for the first time and left a note with more details. After realizing I'd made a typo I tried to edit the note but the keyboard actually covers the text window so it's not possible to see what you're doing. I then tried to delete the note and just start over but it couldn't be deleted, and the changes I made couldnt be saved, so now I'm just stuck with it. Really?",
            "Very basic (that I like), so it could be more user friendly. New activities don't apply to the future, have to create it again & again. Frustrating. Sometimes it won't allow you to save the other activity. You are stuck with the main ones that don't apply. Would be nice if days could be reached by tapping on them in the calendar. Info could be shown too because now it is linear and it's impossible to see months back. You can only add the current day, if you forgot a day, you gotta scroll back.",
            "I really love this app, it helps me a lot. But everytime, the last day of the month, something happens. Last time (May), all the thingyes I wrote for the last day dissapeared. Now (June), all my emotions on the calendar dissapeared, and the counters too ! Like if I didn't do nothing this month...",
            "So far pretty good, however the amount of entries below each emoticon isn't showing for this month but shows under July and even shows 0 entries for June(when I hadn't yet installed it) Overall love the app :)",
            "What a great idea ! You can track your mood and go back to see if there are any similarities or things that may have triggered that mood. For instance everyday around a certain time your mood is tracking as a little bit lower than usual which would help you identify a cause. I could also see this being very helpful to those who have to use medications for their mental health. This would help a great deal for both patient and practitioner to see how well a medication/dose is working"

            "I love this app. It is the best one I have found, so far, which is really free. Other apps make this claim, but then block access to certain material unless a payment is made. As a fairly novice meditation practitioner, I found this app invaluable because there is a beginner's course and intermediate course. Following on from these courses there are a variety of packs for different situations. From daily meditations to managing stress or anxiety, for better sleep, for walking, e.t.c.",
            "Wow, this app is 100% quality. There is content for every situation and it is free. For those of you who are tired by commercialization of meditation apps - this is an app for you. I like that there is a simple customizable timer. Although I don't understand what offline / online mode means in the context of it. Seems like the meditation track is streamed anyway. Developers, could you clarify what that feature does?",
            "Hands down the best app I've ever had for meditation. I've used so many other apps but this one is the only app I've actually stuck to using. The interface is so seamless and so easy to use. And it's 100 percent free. No sneaky purchases or special meditation packs. That sort of transparency is much appreciated and I honestly wouldn't mind donating or paying. I don't know how to support you guys other than this, if there is literally any other way to help, let me know!",
            "After trying several meditation apps (Simple Habit, Headspace, Atom, etc), I like Medito the most because it's simple, user-friendly, and beginner-friendly. All sessions are free and the selection is well curated, which I love because what frustrated me with other apps is that too many options can be overwhelming and having series wherein some episodes are free while others are paid can stunt one's growth. Their \"Getting Started\" collection is useful particularly for a newbie like me, as many of the other apps do not offer in-depth tutorials on what to expect and how to practice correctly. As a cherry on top, I like the options for background sound, especially Spring Field. The audio is balanced well with the voice, so it's not too loud nor soft, and it plays seamlessly. It seems like a small thing, but it's something that had bugged me and turned me off from other apps. If I had to nitpick - it would be wonderful if you can expand your collections under Sleep Meditation and Mantra Affirmations as they currently only have a handful each.",
            "This is my first meditation app and I find it very well made. You can pick what kind of meditation you need as the sessions are divided into sections. The voices are very calming. I've been meditating for about 4 months now and I can see some improvement in managing my stress and being a nicer person in general. Thank you guys and keep up your work!"

It takes too long to search for a disorder, and the first result is usually the name of the disorder with a code, and not a description. It's actually faster to use a DSM-5 book. It's a shame they ruined the original app by making the user experience worse rather than better.",

Imagine sitting down to study for your counseling exam & not having access to your physical copy of the DSM thanks to quarantine but not worrying about it because you know you've invested in this great, easily navigated app only to finally log on to THIS MESS! It also freezes my phone which I haven't had happen with any app in years! I need an update that's similar to before or a refund"

            "Horrible game designed by someone who has no respect, empathy, or understanding for people who genuinely experience depression. The game offers nonsensical solutions to generic descriptions of how someone might describe their depression. Figures but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and not only did the game live up to its criticisms but the ads ruin its playability entirely. It's insulting tapping for a hint to see it for a nanosecond before an ad pops up preventing you from reading the hint.",
            "This feels like a soulless cashgrab, made to keep people watching ads. Most of the tasks are so convoluted, that I found myself pressing hint every time. For people with depression, like myself, this app is terrible at helping anyone through it. The people/person responsible for this, has no heart.",
            "Pretty mediocre. One of the puzzles didn't work for me regardless of me doing what the hint said to do, and the barrage of ads on the hints leave a bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes it'll only play an ad and no hint. Sucks because this had potential.",
            "Annoying as hell! Definitely makes me feel trapped like depression, great on that, but anytime i click 'hint' cause i can't get passed, all I'm met with is an ad for 30 seconds and can't read the actual hint that flashes on the screen for like half a milisecond!",
            "Very unique. This game describes how depression feels and i belive thats a great way to show people who dont quite understand how it feels. Each level is seemingly a challange but then agsin depression is as well. Good job compairing it to a puzzle because depression can take a while to figure out and piece together. As someone who can relate to being in depression you did a good job making each level a bit difficult to represent how hard it is in real life. Cool game. Would recomend. 10/10."

            "So far this is excellent. I was recently diagnosed with depression and need to keep track of my symptoms as well as effects of medications. Most of the other apps have a pre-set list of symptoms, and user is limited to those symptoms. This app allows you to create your own labels for symptoms, so you can be very specific with tracking your health issues. Also, the app creates a nice graph for visual representation of your symptoms. This app is exactly what i needed.",

            "HELP option needed. It does everything I need so far. Had to read 100+ reviews to find developer comments to learn how to use, how to edit, etc. A \"how to/help\" in the dropdown menu is missing. Also, haven't yet figured out tracking >1 person. I got this to track my kid but would like to add myself. Overall it works well so far. Also, I haven't upgraded. Access to the full version (3day trial) would probably yield more upgrades. If full is just ad removal I'm ok with ads",

And I can freely express my anger without having to hear some useless advices. Overall, this app has helped me in dealing with my slight anger issues.",

The progressive muscle relaxation exercise in other VA apps such as CBT-i coach are much better. I hope this is corrected in a future update.",

            "Scanner takes 3 minutes and if it thinks your finger moved at all it restart. It can be very frustrating and obviously a probability towards the accuracy of the final scan. I'm still sticking with it I'm going to give it a 30-day trial I'm halfway through that. I find it useful but I do think that you should be able to add more tags.",
            "This is a good app. I compared the results using Samsung Health stress meter ( I use a Note phone which has a heart rate monitor), and they were fairly accurate. Even the heart rate was accurate to the beat if 2-3 beats per minute. I tested in resting conditions, after exercise, ( where the HRV is minimal, so stress is maximum) and Samsung Health stress results and this app results match perfectly.",
            "This app's heart rate is pretty accurate, but the stress level is just useless. Even if I measure in the middle of a severe panic attack, it says I have low stress. Half the app is in English, half is some Asian language. Not recommended for stress measurement",
            "The ability to use camera for heart rate is very innovative. The app checks the variance of the heart rate from the median and has some predefined set of calculations to get the percentage. This may not be accurate way to calculate mental stress, but the condition of the heart. However, the bpm shown is perfect. So 4 stars, but 1 star less because the stress percentage is not always accurate. It shows different values when taken one after another for me.",

Also, can be used to assist with exposure therapy for Agoraphobia.\r\n\r\nThe Panic Assistance audio is not a relaxation or hypnosis audio. It is meant to be firm so as to get your attention while having a panic attack. Relaxation or hypnosis audios are not very useful during a panic. They may be useful to prevent panic, but this audio is focused on reminding you that panic won't harm you and that you can tolerate the unpleasant sensations of panic.\r\n\r\nEmotion Training audio can be used as relaxation or you can use it to learn how to access emotions such as calmness or strength when you need to. The audio trains the brain to pair the emotions with certain colors and once you have learned the process, you can elicit the emotions you desire by imagining the paired color flowing through you.\r\n\r\nLinks to articles at ExcelAtLife.com to help you understand the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach for anxiety and Panic Disorder. \r\n\r\nThe general idea of CBT is to repeat rational statements that challenge the irrational fears until the rational beliefs become stronger than the fears. Since it is difficult for a person to do this while having a panic attack, the panic assistance audio in this app helps you to do this. This self-help method can provide the coaching many people need to cope with panic. However, some people may need therapeutic help in addition to this.\r\n\r\nUse the relaxation audio to improve your anxiety management skills. Learn to reduce stress and to relax your body using Qi Gong and additional relaxation audios by Excel At Life.\r\n\r\nAlso, look for \"The Worry Box\" app for audio to create imagery to reduce worry and related anxiety.\r\n\r\nReason for permissions:\r\n1) READ PHONE STATE AND IDENTITY--necessary when listening to audios to pause playback when phone call is received (Excel At Life never accesses identity)\r\n2) MODIFY DELETE SD CARD CONTENTS--necessary to allow saving data to SD card\r\n3) FULL INTERNET ACCESS AND VIEW NETWORK STATE--necessary to determine if internet access is available when linking to articles and audios",

I especially appreciate the one on anxiety attacks - I'm prone to them - and it works every time. In addition, there's also a cognituve diary/journal and you can have access to an online source as well. I highly recommend this app.",
            "I just downloaded the app and haven't had a chance to use it, but what stands out immediately is that an anti-anxiety app should perhaps try for a bit calmer, simpler look. The font and colours are actually making me anxious. I'll still give it a shot, but a more minimal look would go far in improving user experience.",
            "I have experienced real support from this app, when caught up in anxiety in middle of the night, as well as relaxing before going to sleep. Therefore very disappointed that it does not work anymore on my new phone...",
            "This app has helped me so many times in calming me when panic strikes. Its as if Im sitting in the therapists office and she talking me through the entire attack. Wonderful self help tool and you choose if you want music or not, which I prefer not. It also has many different audios you can choose for your liking. I very highly recommend this app.",
            "The best help for panic attack I've ever found! I use it for assistance and I'm learning to tolerate my bad thoughts and fisical reaction caused by panic attack. Thank you so much"

Come on. And we can't even make our own moods/faces at all. Can only get rid of pre-made moods. Not too happy with this app. Plus ads ads ads ads ads. Not keeping this. Dailio is far far better. Devs take a note from daylio but don't full out copy them.",

There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, functionally, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken.

            "great app, only request is that you can add more than 20 activities at a time",
            "Could you ask for daily moods and add a year in pixels view?",
            "I like the apps ideas. It can track relationship between activities & mood. Most useful & unique is that when you start an activity it places an icon in the task bar & records mood before starting the activity. When activity is complete, click the icon in the notification bar to make note of your new mood if it changed. Highly recomend but i wish it had a graph to show frequency of moods to activities & hrly reminder. Without that feature, I have to use pen and paper to look for corelations.",
            "Really like this concept. Would be great if there was a way to track your mood during the activity as some things, like wasting hours watching pointless youtube videos, feel good at the time, but make you feel worse afterwards.",
            "Simple format tremendous insights."
