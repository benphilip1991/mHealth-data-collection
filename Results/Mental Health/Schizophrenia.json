        "description": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease. Approximately one percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime - more than two million Americans suffer from the illness in any given year. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties; women are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behaviour can be disorganised and strange to the extent that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others.\r\n\r\nHow is Schizophrenia Diagnosed?\r\n\r\nThere is currently no physical or lab test that can conclusively diagnose schizophrenia - a psychiatrist usually makes the diagnosis based on clinical symptoms. Physical testing can rule out many other conditions (seizure disorders, metabolic disorders, thyroid dysfunction, brain tumour, the effects of street drug use, and so on) that sometimes have similar symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhat causes Schizophrenia?\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact cause of schizophrenia remains unknown, experts agree that schizophrenia develops as a result of interplay between biological predisposition (for example, inheriting certain genes) and environmental factors. These lines of research are beginning to converge: brain development disruption is likely the result of genetic and/or environmental stressors early in development (during pregnancy or early childhood), leading to subtle alterations in the brain. Environmental factors later in development can either damage the brain further and further increase the risk of schizophrenia, or lessen the expression of genetic or neurodevelopment defects, thus decreasing the risk of schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nTreatment for schizophrenia\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association publication 'Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia' states: \"Antipsychotic medications are indicated for nearly all acute psychotic episodes in patients with schizophrenia.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also a significant overlap in terms of the medications for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Manic Depression).\r\nThere are two main classifications of medications (from a layman's perspective); the traditional antipsychotic medications (Haldol, etc.), and the newer, 'atypical' antipsychotic medications that have come out in the past decade (Clozapine, Geodon, Seroquel, Risperdal, Zyprexa, Abilify, etc.). It is recommended that sufferers or their carers speak to online support groups to get in touch with others, and to hear about their personal successes and problems with the different medications. It is also a good idea to read as much as possible regarding the medications available, and talk with a psychiatrist, to identify the medications that may be appropriate. It should be kept in mind that whilst both the older and newer medications can greatly help a person with schizophrenia, they all have significant side effects that vary according to the individual. No medication available, unfortunately, constitutes an actual cure for schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nA natural treatment for schizophrenia?\r\n\r\nWhile the conclusions drawn range from the positive to the negative, research does suggest that people with schizophrenia may benefit by a reduction in symptoms when they take fish oil capsules that are high in the EPA (a type of Omega-3 fatty acid) form of oil.

The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",

Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors.  Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person's reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person. During diagnosis a person's culture must also be taken into account. As of 2013 there is no objective test. Schizophrenia does not imply a \"split personality\" or \"dissociative identity disorder\" – conditions with which it is often confused in public perception.",

            "I think it is very interesting and a fun experience, not 100 percent accurate but pretty close. I do wish though that there was way to type in what you see if you see something different than what is presented in the choices. I think that might help with the accuracy.",
            "This is a short, simple app that exercises thinking on images given. However, while it is interesting to contemplate what you see, the end results aren't so accurate. More-so, given that it has fixed multi-choices to choose from. This test was decent, like most tests, it never should be taken literally; it's about reviewing, pondering, and coming to your own conclusions as to whether something really is describing you or not. Just because you may find 90% matches you, doesn't mean it 100% does.",
            "It is accurate somehow, not at 100% of course but it is. I think the accuracy will increase if you donate to the algorithm more variables in the form of more choice of answers.",

            "Really cool. However it would be nice to type in what I saw if the option is not available. Example: Did you see a goat? Did you see two people? I didn't see eather, then a space to type what I did see. This way the results could be exactly right."

            "I love this app but one of the main paid features does not work. I want to download my entries to send to my therapist but the report output is incorrect. The emotions don't match with the correct day, the time of the entries show only the time you downloaded the report and it doesn't include any of the recorded cognitive dysfunctions I logged. I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",
            "Thus far, I say that this app was perfectly created! So far, what I've seen is very well organized & contains helpful lessons, informational videos, a personal journal, and more! This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

Thank you for making such a beautiful art. ♡ I still.. collect some money to buy the premium one (haha). I hope it could be great seeing your premium art displayed on my android screen, soon. Stay safe and sound! ✿",
            "I found it boring to be honest. I can see some people may like it. It's a choose your own adventure story. It's written well but often offers choices with only the Illusion of choice. All answers seem to lead to the same thing. In the story some questions the characters ask you it really feels like it's gathering information about you to sell off to advertisers. It asks what your hobbies are etc. I am unsure if this is somehow related to the story later on or not I didn't get very far into it.",

The users on this app are very verbally abusive and darogitory towards other users. During my time on this app I have been told to quote \"pull the trigger and blow my brains out\", I have been told to quote \"go hang myself\". And many other abusive statements.

        "description": "Note: The content in this app were made in the light of psycom.net (a mental health platform). The whole app is intended for fun and education purposes. For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

Its fun but yet educational and you don't even realize how much knowledge you obtain from the short everyday challenges. It has helped me in many ways already! Highly recommend to use daily or at least 3-4 times a week upon downloading. Enjoy!!",

The only way i can do it is to eliminate the ones i can see first and hopefully they will be the last ones. I turned on colour blind mode but I don't know if it worked. It wasnt black and white. Some of the colours were invisible to me.",

Now that I'm pushing 50 I'm taking my own advice-this app is perfect for it! Not only are the games fun, you can work targeted areas, track your progress, and see what percentile you are in.🤘",

            "Did this just for fun as I have been diagnosed with multiple things. It detected the Borderline Personality Disorder, but let's be real, that isn't difficult at all. It also diagnosed me with something I have never heard of (and now wish I had written down as I have uninstalled the app already) because it was so far off of my personality indicating that I did extreme things to achieve affection and felt useless without their attentions. Very far off ;) just for fun, enjoyed, now done ;)",
            "some of the questions were worded a bit off like they didn't make a lot of sense or grammar was so far off I was unsure what they were asking. also a personal issue I kept forgetting the scale value like of 1 was most or least true so if app creators want to cater to us absent minded people and put it on each page 😏 otherwise fellow absent minders right it down right, I know took me 3 times but I figured out the \"cheat\" lmao",
            "the test was okay but the instructions are covered by a big continue sign or next so I scored the questions incorrectly and had to take the test over again. they need to remove the sign that covers the instructions on the first home screen. otherwise the test was fine and the results I'm not too sure about",
            "Limited questions. Limitation in judgment and diagnosis. Not adequate details as enough for different cases. Not true results for all cases. In one word = It's a limited database and AI engine so it has not proper results. It's not bad but needs to have more improvements also it has not complete trusted results.",
            "It may take some time to complete the test but the end result is quite interesting. It tells you your score and there you can see what you can work on to try to be better"

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "I don't think I need seeing psychologist, but I totally agree with my results. Also, I liked the description of each disorder, how they clarify this app isn't a diagnosis and you should see a professional if those traits affect too much your life.",
            "This test was very accurate, as long as your honest. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I did the test and I had three. I would suggest anyone that might want to know to do this test.",
            "Upon a search of \"disorder\", within the top 10 results I see 3 \"psycnet\" apps, of which one of them is #1 result. While the information is good, (atleast the offline content), it is regurgitated from other sources. The layout of each app is identical, however the icon images on download screen seem \"too\" unique, thereby concealing the relationship until further examination. Its a tad creepy, considering the online \"tests\" and information stored from within the apps.",
            "I've been diagnosed,beginning at a young age,with mental health disorders.Although I enjoy taking online tests such as this,for the most part the results are not indicative of my diagnosis.THIS PARTICULAR SCREENING TEST was extremely accurate, so much so that my first thought(I found myself lmao)was I could have saved innumerable visits and time if only 30 years ago this app had been available for me to stumbled upon. Absolutely \"On Point\"Terrific job devs. Check it out,thank me later, lol.",
            "The test knew exactly what I have. I'm a psych student and I have a personality disorder, so I thought I'd see if the app would guess right. I answered honestly and found myself thinking that because I'm medicated and so mentally healthy right now it wouldn't pick up on it. But when I got to the end, that BPD bar was the only blip and it was sticking straight out. So unless everyone else also got BPD, I'd say this is pretty realistic. Still, I wouldn't rely on this for a diagnosis."

            "Horrible game designed by someone who has no respect, empathy, or understanding for people who genuinely experience depression. The game offers nonsensical solutions to generic descriptions of how someone might describe their depression. Figures but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and not only did the game live up to its criticisms but the ads ruin its playability entirely. It's insulting tapping for a hint to see it for a nanosecond before an ad pops up preventing you from reading the hint.",
            "This feels like a soulless cashgrab, made to keep people watching ads. Most of the tasks are so convoluted, that I found myself pressing hint every time. For people with depression, like myself, this app is terrible at helping anyone through it. The people/person responsible for this, has no heart.",
            "Pretty mediocre. One of the puzzles didn't work for me regardless of me doing what the hint said to do, and the barrage of ads on the hints leave a bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes it'll only play an ad and no hint. Sucks because this had potential.",
            "Annoying as hell! Definitely makes me feel trapped like depression, great on that, but anytime i click 'hint' cause i can't get passed, all I'm met with is an ad for 30 seconds and can't read the actual hint that flashes on the screen for like half a milisecond!",
            "Very unique. This game describes how depression feels and i belive thats a great way to show people who dont quite understand how it feels. Each level is seemingly a challange but then agsin depression is as well. Good job compairing it to a puzzle because depression can take a while to figure out and piece together. As someone who can relate to being in depression you did a good job making each level a bit difficult to represent how hard it is in real life. Cool game. Would recomend. 10/10."

            "This test was very accurate, as long as your honest. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I did the test and I had three. I would suggest anyone that might want to know to do this test.",
            "Upon a search of \"disorder\", within the top 10 results I see 3 \"psycnet\" apps, of which one of them is #1 result. While the information is good, (atleast the offline content), it is regurgitated from other sources. The layout of each app is identical, however the icon images on download screen seem \"too\" unique, thereby concealing the relationship until further examination. Its a tad creepy, considering the online \"tests\" and information stored from within the apps.",
            "I've been diagnosed,beginning at a young age,with mental health disorders.Although I enjoy taking online tests such as this,for the most part the results are not indicative of my diagnosis.THIS PARTICULAR SCREENING TEST was extremely accurate, so much so that my first thought(I found myself lmao)was I could have saved innumerable visits and time if only 30 years ago this app had been available for me to stumbled upon. Absolutely \"On Point\"Terrific job devs. Check it out,thank me later, lol.",
            "The test knew exactly what I have. I'm a psych student and I have a personality disorder, so I thought I'd see if the app would guess right. I answered honestly and found myself thinking that because I'm medicated and so mentally healthy right now it wouldn't pick up on it. But when I got to the end, that BPD bar was the only blip and it was sticking straight out. So unless everyone else also got BPD, I'd say this is pretty realistic. Still, I wouldn't rely on this for a diagnosis."

            "Annoying as hell! Definitely makes me feel trapped like depression, great on that, but anytime i click 'hint' cause i can't get passed, all I'm met with is an ad for 30 seconds and can't read the actual hint that flashes on the screen for like half a milisecond!",
            "Very unique. This game describes how depression feels and i belive thats a great way to show people who dont quite understand how it feels. Each level is seemingly a challange but then agsin depression is as well. Good job compairing it to a puzzle because depression can take a while to figure out and piece together. As someone who can relate to being in depression you did a good job making each level a bit difficult to represent how hard it is in real life. Cool game. Would recomend. 10/10."

Its interesting to go through a negative belief that you may have and that it makes you challenge that negative thought with a positive one. Dear developers: I think a search bar or something similar could be very helpful! A way to type in the specific feeling or thought you're having and being able to get relating affirmations from the keywords that you enter in. :)",

If you want some constructive reframing without the cutesy cartoon animals, Thinkladder's got you. Only way to make it better would be more content (but you guys are still working on that update, right?) Thanks for a great app!",

            "It started off fun and interesting. I thought I could use it to help spread good energy for world healing, but it seems this is not possible without giving them money to open and understand things better. Some of us don't have it, and your blocking us out from helping, if that is your true intention. ^_^ Money in spiritual endeavors is such a sticky subject for the ones who don't seek material things or power... Yikes! :-P",
            "I love this app. Helps me in my spiritual and healing work to create the right energy, and helps me to refocus and ground after sessions.",
            "Laggy interface with app and sound will occasionally cut off randomly. Also, it would be nice to play the application in the background. The frequencies themselves are amazing and I'm looking forward to purchasing once the kinks have been ironed out",
            "I am a witness of this app.this app has some super natural powers yo heal body and soul. i have tried many applications and i found this app and this app is superb with some extra powers and after using this app i can say i have put my money at the right place. A very powerful app for healing mind and soul i must say every one should give it a try.",

            "Awesome. You could make it so you can chat from the PC and invite people. You can drop food & trash or place it on a table instead. More items. WE NEED MORE ITEMS! More content. Ability to expand house. Order furniture and move already existing furniture around to make the house your own. Decrease the freeze cooldown. Add more cheaper customization options. Overall good concept! Love the sync feature, so I don't lose progress. How do you get an invitation from the neighbor btw? ☺",
            "Its very unique, and just like most game there is a few bugs like the water balloons being dropped at people below, it will stick to my character's hand and wont drop. I love that they added more stuff to it like dog and cat options they are actually useful and worth getting one. If I were to suggest anything for the game it would be the option to choose gender that way us females can relate more to it cause there are women like this as well as a male in the real world.",
            "Very good game. But when i go to stats for example it says 15 hours left. And i look at it the next day and it says 5 days left. I dont know why is this happening.",
            "This game's awesome, it's simplicity and how relatable it is are great. I would love that the player could buy even more things, maybe a different kind of bed or something. I really appreciate the efforts of the developers :)",
            "I really really like this game, there are no random ads and strategically lets you watch them to gain something actually useful and it doesn't take alot of effort, it's simple and its good, its worth playing plus it has that slavic representation which i live for as a slavic person. I cant explain it but this game is charming and really fun"

Refreshing, and grateful that I stumbled across TalkLife. Keep it secret, keep it safe. ;)",

Especially the groups we can moderate our own group and publicize it. So happy to see a community growing and being a part of it.",

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions.

Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

            "I really really like this app, DBT saved my life -- I still have much to improve upon. Practicing DBT on a daily basis has helped me to regain control of my emotions and allows me to stay focused and determined. DBT Coach is outstanding as a stand alone app, but for me personally it provides an effective substitution for a therapist during this transtion until I am able to afford individual sessions again.",
            "For $11.99 a month the app keeps crashing when certain lessons are opened. So you're paying for an app the only some content works. It's a shame because if it worked properly it would be worth it.",
            "The app is WAY overpriced. I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills. So I have used this app for two weeks and now cannot access/use the data accurately for my appointment tomorrow. If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",
            "I see potential. Needs better design and pricing. Will continue to use it to see how far I can go with free version. Also, needs someone to refresh the writing for a general audience. The video tour doesn't seem to work on my phone. Design is not intuitive. I had to figure it out by clicking around.",
            "Like the app, but it doesn't save your entry more times than not. Very frustrating."

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

Talkspace has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, CNN.com, Business Insider, and more. \r\n\r\nFor more research data, visit research.talkspace.com. \r\nFor more of our press coverage, visit talkspace.com/online-therapy/press/\r\n\r\nWHO ARE THE TALKSPACE THERAPISTS?\r\n\r\nThe Talkspace provider network has thousands of licensed therapists across the 50 U.S. states who have been vetted and accredited according to NCQA standards.

            "Cannot book sessions. No customer support. My therapist was great, but haven't been able to book another session. This issue is not resolved!!!! Took customer support 13 days to get back to me and thier response did not help. I guess I have to wait another 13 days now...who knows? I'm so annoyed by this. I'm just going to cancel my membership - instead of Talkspace helping me with anything it's become another source of frustration in my life. Freakin' worthless.",
            "I submitted a question to customer support 11 days ago and have not gotten a response yet. I want to cancel my account, but there is no button to cancel or deactivate. This app is terrible. The texting feature is one of the major reasons I signed up for Talkspace, but I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth since my therapist does not respond for 8-12 hours. When she does respond, she just says she has some ideas that could help me, but that she will share them during our next session, making me wait several days for any sort of lifeline! I need help now! I'm paying for this service! On another similar therapy app, I was able to message back and forth with my therapist and get instant feedback. As for the video chats, I would have preferred if my therapist would have been stationed in one place the whole time instead of walking around her house. It was a bit unprofessional and even when she was sitting down because she had a tv on somewhere in the house and she was moving the camera all around making me sea sick. To make matters worse, I had no way of knowing if anyone at her house could hear our conversation! She had a lot of experience as a therapist, but admitted that she was new to Talkspace and had not yet read all of the handbook and all the rules she was supposed to follow as a provider. When we got booted out of our video call three times, she suggested that we FaceTime. Again, not professional! Talkspace is a secure platform where mental health information can be shared. FaceTime is not! I'm going back to the other app I was using before. It was slightly more expensive, but wayyyy better!",
            "Do not waste your time or money with this app. My therapist has been really wonderful and responsive, but the app is absolute trash. I reached out to support and the only response I received was, \"We've received your support request, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" That's it. No actual response to my concern. I can't book new sessions because I \"don't have any session credits available\" and there's no obvious/visible way for me to even pay to book another session. To top it off, the sessions that I have booked with my therapist have been such poor quality that I am literally talking to a blank screen because her face never shows up, despite us both having very fast internet connection speeds. I'm really disappointed in the general usability of the app, the complete lack of customer service, and the quality of the calls between me and my therapist.",
            "The issue has been resolved. Thank you! I was charged a total of 8 times in one month and still have not heard back from customer service or been issued a refund. On top of that, the app is still behaving as if i haven't renewed my subscription despite having taken 8 monthly charges out. If customer service ever reaches out and resolves the issue then I will change my rating because I love my therapist, but I dont like being multi-charged for a service I am not receiving.",
            "Received an invite link to this service. The first therapist told us they could not accommodate video sessions, which is what we paid for. The second therapist did not respond to any messages. Talkspace seems unable or unwilling to provide the service we paid for."

I like that it has tests, organized set ups for different types of diary logs. It also gives you ideas and helpful tips. It makes it easier to decide how you're feeling and gauge how strongly you're feeling it. Lots of options and articles, and more! This is pretty cool, I'll be telling people about this app."

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

            "A good app for very basic, grounded challenges people with simple lives might face. It's very lacking, however, when it comes to greater, more complex, interconnected challenges. At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",

I haven't been using this for long, but I have a feeling this will change your life for the better if you using it regularly and take advantage of the resources on this app.",

            "It's been eye opening to track my mood and the things I'm grateful for. This seems to be helping me stay focused on the positive, which in turn improves my mood.",
            "Thank You for putting this app together, I'm finding it concise, user friendly and helpful. I have no negative feedback but thought it might be helpful to let you know my favourite features so far; 1. I've really connected with the little statements that pop up each time I log on. They're helpful reminders and feel like a friendly voice cheering me on. 2. Love the easy 🙂 for mood description and the tab options. It means in those moments you can't find the words or are just tired, you can simply choose a word. 3. I'm also getting alot from the articles you email me. As well as quality content, they're short so easy to take in and daily so I'm not overwhelmed with info. To sum up, really impressed with this app and finding it easy to include it in my day, so confident I can keep it going when I'm back at work again. Great job Team, thanks! 👍👏",
            "I've been using Moodfit for about 6 months and highly recommend it. It's a valuable tool in helping me manage my anxiety. I like being able to create my own shortcuts and goals and regularly use the gratitude, grounding and breathing tools. It can be buggy, but for a free app with no ads, I'm not complaining, and the customer service is great: quick, friendly and effective."

            "I really, really enjoy the app... But I bought the subscription for a year, and it never loaded. The exact dollar amount was taken off my debt card. I'm giving it 4 stars, when normally I would 1 star an app for taking my money. However, their customer support is outstanding!! 🤗 💕",
            "This was recommended to me. I am interested in cognitive health. It was fun and engaging. I can see the benefit of interacting with these games everyday. I want to do more.",
            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",
            "I like the app. The only thing that truely bothers me is that there is not a mute button/setting to mute the music while playing the games."

        "recentChanges": "Fix for Android 10 users experiencing difficulty pairing their aids to their devices.",
        "comments": [
            "After the first week I have experienced zerorl problems connecting to my hearing aides, setup was easy and straightforward. I understand keeping the settings fairly simple however it would be nice for those who choose to have more \"advanced\" settings where have more frequency control and such. Would like to hopefully see more bluetooth features in the future. All in all a very good app and love the hearing aides.",
            "Update 9/10/20 - App fails to find Right aid. Swap batteries between devices and both connect. Battery level indicator ALWAYS shows Pea Green [Yellow in the manual] on both devices. Replaced batteries. App never shows anything but Pea Green until app won't connect. App might show Green for a few seconds with new batteries if the app is started within a few seconds after the battery door is closed. Without both devices connected, app is useless as it will not move past the connection screen. App version claims 2.1.4 but is more like 0.0.214 Phone app is difficult to adjust levels. \"Sliders\" jump and give annoying \"Maximum Threshold Reached\" message. HI has the most effect. MID and LOW, much less. Adjustability is fair. It takes a bit of futzing with EQ, Noise Reduction and Direction to achieve results. Aids annoyingly reset to Min and Program 1 if batteries are disconnected. Level adjustment could say L1, L2, etc. rather than just beep for levels 2 plus. Programs state Program 1, Program 2. Updated after 3 go-rounds: App is usable to configure and set various program functions. Completed the test on both devices, created profile. When I open app, no profile and it wants me to start over from scratch. The inability to remember devices is a pain. Having to depower one hearing aid so it can find the other is a joke in today's connected world. Really terrible application flow. Adjusting profile after completion based on age and gender makes no sense.",
            "Good concepts but improvements needed 1. Connection issues.. getting worst 2. Volume adjusting down randomly. 3 program is loss. Then a number appears where program icon was. What does this number mean. 4. Emailed support. Said they needed more info. If I had more info I would have sent it. 5. When all the above happens the hearing aids are telling me something. I dont know what because I cant hear. Why not have option for notifications on phone. The maybe I can give suppor more info",
            "I use the app daily with my MDHearing Core hearing aids, both right and left ear aids, and it works great. I love being able to change the program to suit my current environment, i.e. in a restaurant. One minor glitch I have discovered is that if your profile is established for both right and left ear aids, when you are only wearing one aid or if the battery is dead in one of the aids, the app refuses to sync with the one hearing aid you are wearing.",
            "So far no problem with the app. Sometimes a little slow connecting to the hearing aids. Very happy with these hearing aids."

            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Even samsung health comes with free tracker for steps etc. I need a visual to help me assess and so this app and every other Anxiety app I've tried fail as nobody does the tracker for free.",

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

            "I love that this teaches mindful, intuitive eating and not dieting/ restricting. It really helps me to slow down and listen to my body. I am very impressed with this app! I also love the meditations 🧘‍♀️",
            "I was looking for an app where I could track macros but not calories. I end up restricting and getting too obsessive. This doesn't track macros but I couldn't care less. It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",
            "Excellent tool. Keep up the exceptional work! It has been very useful to me and made the process very positive. Thank you!"

I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

            "All it did was ask about 10 questions & tell me I had a score of 45. It didn't explain the score. It asked me if I wanted counseling. Then prompted me asking what kind of counseling and then wanted my personal info to sell me therapy. This is just a referral source to paid therapists. Doesn't identify your level of PTSD. Does not offer any assistance unless you pay for it. Typical cash grab app that wants to make money off people's suffering.",

            "Easy to use; accessible and very blind friendly; thank you. It's getting very hard to find an app that isn't overloaded with unlabeled images, buttons, and circular sliders. Thanks for a straight-from-the-hip, getter-done meditation app. You're welcome. I'm really grateful that the reminders are verbal as well. Most apps seem to think that visual reminders are enough, but blind people don't have the luxury of looking at their phones constantly, so thanks for talking to me.",
            "An excellent, totally free mindfulness app. Smiling Mind covers everything from children to teenagers to adult mindfulness foundations, with a variety of specific targeted mindfulness courses of all sorts to help with different areas like sleep, stress, relationships, work - etc. I've been using it for years and it's wonderfully ad free. As for mindfulness itself, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're curious, Smiling Mind is a perfect place to start.",
            "This app is so great when it works. It gets quite glitchy when it comes to member login and member data. It will not let me reset my password because apparently my email address is not present in the system but I am unable to register a new email address because I'm already registered in the system! When I was still able to login it would randomly delete my data and programs/progress. It will also sometimes just freeze in the middle of a meditation.",
            "I like the meditations however I dont like the layout and navigation of the app. A lot of the meditations are too similar, cant skip and have a long intro that I dont want to hear every time. The app logs me out often too and I have to login, which is an annoying inconvenience when I'm trying to relax to sleep. I fell asleep to it and it kept playing the whole night for 8 hours. And just then I was listening and it kept skipping to the beginning. It was rather creepy actually and now I'm on edge",
            "This app is amazing and has helped me to sleep again. I was relying on a number of medications to sleep but the guided mediations have drastically changed that for me. I cannot thank everyone involved in this enough, so I'm going to donate as well. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful tool freely available and without ads, it really has changed my life 😘"

            "First of all, it's completely free to use, and there are no ads. Already standing out from the crowd. The app itself is just really good. Only used it for a couple days but seems really good so far. Love the kind of \"social media stories\" layout think it works well apart from it goes back instead of forward quite often when tapping near the middle. Thank you!",
            "Impressive, clarifying and insightful. This app is beautifully designed (not just visually, but also from a user design perspective). It's easy, small little tasks that are done in 2/3 minutes and give you a bit more insight or help you when your head is racing because of... F.e. stress. Give it a try. It's quite unbelievable it's free. I would love to pay a one time sum of money / small donation to use it!",
            "Its been excellent so far. Not invasive, but still gives me incentive to go back to it. I like the way things are paced, and i've surprisingly really enjoyed the journaling feature (something I was pretty sure I was going to use exactly zero times unless forced). All in all just a calm space that i can go to once or twice a day to reflect and try to better myself a bit. Easily recommended.",
            "This app was so wonderful! Compared to other apps which have limited things for free, this app has everything you need for FREE!! It has so many rescue sessions that help me so much! Every 3-4 days there are check-ins, and I definitely don't regret installing this app!! Sometimes the page takes a long time to load. But overall I LOVE this app and definitely reccomend it!!",
            "Just wow... I've used apps making similar claims, usually disappointed in what I experience; ads constantly or gimmicky content locked behind Premium version. Not so with Intellect! It's free and ad free but more than that, it actually does what it claims. This app has and continues to help me immensely and I am going to say the craziest thing but, I'd like to pay for it! It's rare to find such value and I highly recommend Intellect to everyone. We all have things to improve. Thank you so much!"

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "This app is amazing. I love Barry's voice, its very calm, clear and soothing to listen too. I love the SOS section. I listen to this app every night in bed. It has helped me so much with my panic attacks and anxiety reducing the impacts to managing my Diabetes. I have highly recommended this app to my doctor, friends and my psychologist to help other people in my local community of regional Sydney Australia. A huge thank you to the Dare team :)",
            "I must say that it's a great app and great initiative by the team , we live in a busy world n everyone is busy with themselves , but anxiety , crisis , depression are not rare , n even our dear ones sometimes do not constantly have the time to listen to our worries n be there for us , so this is where help like this is very important , i listened 4-5 audios n I m already feeling calm , n from now on I m gonna just put this on n drive away my anxiety n fears , I think it will be possible , thanku",
            "Amazing App to help you conquer anxiety! Barry has a soothing voice and his audios are outstanding! I am so happy that I stumbled on this app. The content is extensive and super helpful. The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",
            "I like that I can listen to the stories on loop for free. I love the SOS section that can talk someone through a panic attack. For free!"

I feel very lucky, more optimistic creating daily habit of journaling with premium features.. Really love the visuals, simple yet elegant and artistic.. Keep up the good work! I hope I don't have any issues about data backup..",
            "I just downloaded the app and its really good, i really like how you can write all your thoughts and feelings. However, there are some negative things about this app. I wanted to add a passcode to the app so that no one can see all my thoughts and diaries, but it said that i had to pay. I don't think that is fair because i dont have the money to pay and it could be thesame for many other people and keeping your thoughts private on this app should be for free. Other than that, the app is good.",

            "I have only been using this app for a few days and it has been very helpful. The meditations and breathing exercises are short and sweet with option sound and vibrations to help keep you on task. I am very happy with the journal as well! I like the option to pick emotion stickers for the day and answer simple questions vs freestyle (although you have 2000 characters for that too).",
            "I've been using this app for a little under a week and have been finding it pretty helpful so far. Haven't had the need to try out the panic button yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the rest of the app seems helpful. That said, I am very confused as to how I can have a \"20 day Journal streak\" when I've only had the app for about five days. It's doesn't impact the function at all, but it is a very strange glitch on the gameification side of things.",
            "I have read through the information provided and found it very useful. It is very clear and easy to understand how to use the app. Even though I haven't yet taken out their paid subscription, there are still activities you can do for free. I have found so far, this to be the best Anxiety/Panic Attack App I've come across.",
            "Absolutely love this app. Would be rad if there was a chatbot like woebot or self-education quizzes to help understand ourselves & our issues. Only thing I'd change is hiding the stuff only paid users can access. Maybe prevent accidently clicking on a premium feature by having all the free features in 1 area? Being reminded we're too poor to access features that could help us, is depressing & anxiety provoking.",
            "Had an issue signing up but the rootd IT team was quick to resolve my issue. The app is very helpful and I would certainly recommend it to others that are struggling with anxiety and panic attacks."

        "description": "The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\r\n\r\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\r\n\r\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

In addition, Moodflow goes along with you throughout your life, and gives you a deeper understanding of yourself, not previously known to you. Ultimately, this will allow you to improve your mental health and help you become a better you.\r\n\r\n🤗 HOW DOES MOODFLOW WORK? \r\nYou do not even need to write anything down to get a meaningful insight or to keep a diary.\r\n\r\nThis is how easy Moodflow works:\r\nFill out a quick survey every day and gain insight into the WHAT and HOW it influences you over time.\r\n\r\n• 1. Pick a rating for the day from 1 to 5.\r\n• 2. Pick the emotions you experienced.\r\n• 3. (optional) Write a note about everything important from the day.\r\n• 4. (optional) Pick the activities you did during the day.\r\n• 5. DONE! 😁\r\n\r\n👀WHAT WILL THIS DATA DO FOR ME?\r\nAs time goes by, these short entries will gather insightful data about yourself that you will be able to analyze in many ways. On the one hand, a Calendar will be filled with colors that reflect your emotional well-being. This will allow you to get an eagle-eye perspective on your life that you never had before. On the other hand, Moodflow comes with data-analyzing tools, that will help you find relationships between a plethora of different factors and your mood.

These challenges have different levels of difficulty and will ensure that you create simple but powerful habits. As some have claimed: \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit\".\r\n\r\nMore Features? We have them!\r\n\r\n★ Multiple entries per day: Our mood fluctuates throughout the day. Therefore, you should be able to make as many entries as you want.\r\n\r\n★ No annoying ads: Support the app by watching an advertisement.

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "So flipping good this app! It's like having a counselor in your pocket and it sends \"nudges\" or notifications to your partner when you complete a section so that they can engage too. Marriage counseling at a fraction of the cost! Waited 10 years to finally download an app that would've helped those 10 years go way smoother! I feel silly for not looking for something so easily accessible before! Highly recomend!",
            "This app forces you and your partner to answer some pretty tough questions, but the devs have laid out an excellent format for couples where these sessions can be done solo (without fear it judgement) and answer comparisons that can easily melt the icy heart. All the while, being offered guidance and knowledgeable insight every step of the way. Great job Lasting Team. Thank you for such a great app",
            "Loving this app so far. It has created MUCH needed communication and understanding of each of our current needs for us to work on individually as well as together. It is helping us grow in the right direction. I love all the reminders too throughout the day.",
            "Today is the 7th day of my 7 day free trial, I did not decide to subscribe and wasn't asked if I wanted to pay for more than the free 7 day trial, but my bank account was charged anyways. I haven't even opened the app in a couple days. I would like my money returned now that my bank is in the negative and I was not notified before it was charged.",
            "Lasting is a fantastic tool to improve anyones relationship health if you follow and use the tools given. Excellent at revealing the inner thoughts of each person! It even helps you to say what you want to say to your partner, for those having trouble finding the right words."

        "description": "Depression is an extreme low mood that lasts a long time and makes a person feel sad,\r\nirritable or empty. Many people, including many teens, have suffered in this way. A\r\ndepressed person:\r\n^ has much less energy to do activities\r\n^ feels like nothing matters.\r\n^ sees life in a negative way.\r\n^ feels like it will never get better\r\nBut depressed people do get better and depression does end. There are effective\r\ntreatments and self-help skills to deal with depression. Health care professionals give\r\ndepression treatments, but you can learn self help skills and apply them to your own life. This guide teaches a set of antidepressant skills you can use to overcome depression. Sometimes the skills can be used on their own, when the depression\r\nisn’t too severe. Sometimes they have to be used along with treatments by professionals.\r\nDealing with Depression is meant for those who have been coping with depressed mood. Some of the things in this guide will make more sense to younger teens and some will make more sense to older ones. But check it out for yourself. Decide which parts of this guide make sense for your life.\r\nThis Depression Test is designed to help you evaluate the severity of your depression with just nine simple questions. This app uses the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), an empirically-based, self-test questionnaire. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health.\r\n DISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression. Remember that this app should not be used as a replacement for professional treatment or guidance.\r\nDo you suffer from depression? Depression may stem from a personal tragedy or from sad unexpected events or circumstances. It does not discriminate its victims. Depression can affect anyone regardless of their background, race, age, income, etc.\r\nThe natural management of depression involves understanding depression and the factors that contribute to the symptoms. Learning to manage stress in your life and engage in self-care behaviors can improve your symptoms and your mood.\r\nDepression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. \r\nThis app is designed to help with Depression treatment and controlling stress by advising mood enhancing foods, teaching the importance of writing wellness journals and how to get adequate sleep during depressive episodes.\r\nDealing with Depression app is an app that helps you diagnose the level of depression you have, and based on that it gives you the suitable solution for your depression level, in some cases depression is only a result of anxiety and some passing problems, but if the person did not get out of that condition then his condition might advance, we will give you some ways to avoid the advancement of your situation, if the depression is severe we will guide you to what to do as soon as possible\r\nDepression is common but many people don't admit to it. Some people feel there is a stigma attached, or that people will think they are weak. Great leaders such as Winston Churchill have had depression. Depression is one of the most common illnesses that GPs deal with. People with depression may be told by others to \"pull their socks up\" or \"snap out of it\". The truth is, they cannot and such comments by others are very unhelpful.\r\nDepression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest.",

Available in all formats so accessible to all. Free with Kindle Audio trial I believe.",

I am fond of the idea that the author gave the reader the chance to interact. I feel like there are things I can take from this to help. Pleased with the app.",
            "Dealing with Depression is an awesome app for anyone dealing with depression. The author provided a self care process that’s effective and easy to follow. So many forget that self care is a must. The self care activities provided ways to help you acknowledge and incorporate new routines in your daily routines.",

            "I used this app years ago and quit for 3 months before i stopped using it and fell off. It was my first try. Im using it again now and it is a great way to stay on track. The premium version is also inexpensive and i love how i can pay weekly for the added features. If you are serious about quitting, I highly recommend this app. It is the lifeline that made me quit the first time and im so excited to say that I am a nonsmoker now!",
            "This app's easy to use interface and prompts keep one motivated in quitting. I have been off cigarettes for a week now. The diary writing, quit coach, save money options are something that give one an added incentive. The graphical representation of progress in terms of effect on body has also given me greater awareness of how I have been hurting myself with this death stick.",
            "I really liked it at the start, free trial was great, reminders, chats with the robot. I went into the app today to see how much money I've saved. I've been kicked out, all my stats are gone. There's no where to sign in! This is a major flaw. I'm so disappointed.",
            "Great stuff. At such a vulnerable time, I find it helpful to be distracted by \"the good news\" & outcomes from my healthier choices. And as we all know, stopping is super easy compared to \"staying stopped'. \"Not another puff no matter what\" says it all.",
            "Very Helpful!!! Free, informative and bolstering. Helped get me on track, counting days for me so I didnt focus on it. Telling me useful information that strengthened my resolve. All for the price of free fiddy. Take the leap, you will feel so much better in many ways."

        "description": "Binaural beats music is used by people all over the world as a form of ‘brainwave entrainment’ – a process used to entrain the brain into different states that contribute positively to well-being and personal-development.\r\n\r\nWhat most people don’t realize is that although the creation of binaural beats music has only been possible through technological advancement in the last 100 or so years, the use of this natural science dates back thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAncient cultures were aware of how the brain could be entrained through sound repetition well before modern science was able to prove the process. Of course, in centuries past, societies didn’t refer to this science as binaural beats, but what they did know was that consistent, rhythmic sound had extremely powerful healing and spiritual benefits.\r\n\r\nWe developed this Binaural Beats app in 2010 after we’ve learned about binaural beats and used them ourselves to solve sleeping issues due to the stress of our modern busy lives, something that most of us experience today unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThrough the years we’ve received amazing feedbacks from our users, which gives us the motivation and the energy to continue to improve the app. Check out all our reviews :-)\r\n\r\nWe’ve developed different types of presets : sleep, meditation, focus & attention, faster learning, pain reduction, creativity, anxiety reduction ….\r\nIt may take some time of practice to feel the effects of binaural beats so don’t give up after your first try.\r\n\r\nWe really recommend first time users to check out our Facebook (http://on.fb.me/lBDvPK) and Google+ (http://bit.ly/FBBTGP) communities.

ADHD ran the entire preprogrammed time without stopping.",

HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",
            "For those of you dealing with the app getting killed in the background regardless of your battery optimization settings...try Mindroid. This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",

It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking.

The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you'll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief.

Example: my closest pollen count location is 248 miles away. So, it reports that the pollen count is low when it's actually very high (I live in an area devastated by Hurricane Michael & our allergen counts are always through the roof). If they change where they derive their data from, I'll be back. Garbage app.",

Tired of waiting for REAL fixes. Every update says it fixes something, but the app just looks the same. Everything low but dust, which is extremely high. Nothing ever changes anymore and since such, no notifications are received any longer (android device).",

            "It's great and easy to use. It's not just a time tracker. It goes through the physical and mental effects from day one to 10 year. We know about hangovers and withdrawals...but do you know about cell regeneration or how long it take the neuron activity to take place? Interesting app. I wish it had an option for more reminders or different types (not just you've been sober now 100 hours...congratulations)",
            "This app keeps track of not just how many days you're alcohol free, but potentially how much money you have saved. The positive benefits to your health. A little distraction game to get you through a hard moment, and a way to track triggers so \"IF\" you are trying to do deep dives into the WHY of your drinking habits. Totally a neat tool whether you are doing this on your own, with a therapist, or through an organized group.",
            "Terrible app! Too many ads and you can't even use any of the sections such as how long since your last drink. This is supposed to motivate you into quitting slowly yet you can't even select sections such as how many days/ hours sober. Worthless! Uninstalling",
            "Really, really wish the icons for the badges were each different from the last. Takes away from the satisfaction of achievement if they all look the same (for me at least). Otherwise, love the app and you can honestly use it to track any addiction tbh"

Perhaps adding the option of music during the meditation might be the only improvement I would make... and possibly lengthen the log area just about 20-30 more characters for logging ideas. Thanks again for providing the app.",
            "I love this app! It really works if you give it a chance, it's also something from the Government that's REALLY FREE! I been suffering from PTSD for over 20 years. Living on a fixed income makes it impossible to afford someone elses income. Just by hapenstance I found this & I thank God that I have a way to calm myself down on/in those \"uncomfortable\" times.",
            "Neat, clean, simple, and simply the best meditation app. No ads, no subscriptions - just mindfulness. Kudos to the great work! Note: used to be buggy when I tried a year or two ago. But now (as of summer 2020) it is totally bug-free and faultless.",
            "Such an awesome app that too free of cost...the mindfulness exercise they provide I thought they will charge for it because they are so helpful and for every thing in your life a mindfulness is present whether for emotional distress,nap,sleep, eating,walking everything...thank you so much the developers..god bless you ❤️",
            "By far one of the best and cleanest and most simple mindfulness app I have ever used.

            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

And I feel like there is too many features locked for premium that I can't do anything.",

First I wanna say that it only dives into mania/hypomania, which would not be as useful to my friends with type two.

            "Audio is useless. Developers should consider more resolution subcategories too. Overall it's a great app if you are seeking to self improve by changing your perspective in your relationship. It helped me understand things in a different way.",
            "I would absolutely recommend this app to friends and family. I used it on my boyfriend who didn't think he was jealous. Now he knows different. I did find out for myself that apparently, I'm not jealous enough. I think it's a great tool and I think most people will benefit from it. Everyone deserves a happy and healthy relationship. Just be sure the jealousy is warranted. Stay safe and healthy.",
            "This app really helped me to see things about myself that I wouldn't have been able to see or identify before. Its given me the tools to guide myself and to help me manage my emotions. It definitely will take time, but I believe this app helps."

            "Nice app. Have used it for years now. Needed some as I have many heart issues. The only problem I have found is that responses list for organ donor. I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

            "I like the simplicity of the app; and though some customization and home screen widgets are locked behind the pro version, I think this is a great app with a very simplistic UI. As a Programmer myself, I would have to say that this has been built very well and so far I haven't experienced any hiccups or software issues with the app. My only gripe, and this is just because I'm frugal, is the pricing of the Premium version. 4.99 just seems a lot to me to unlock basic customization options.",
            "This is the best of the quitting habit trackers I've tried. Nice simple yet classy UI, & adding motivational cards helps remember why I'm doing this. I have used it for ages so upgraded to premium for extra goals. I also like the dark theme. The only thing I would have liked in premium was maybe an added diary or notes, though I still think it was well worth my money.",
            "I expected a bit more features and options, but it's rather good. Good and easy UI, everything is clear and easy, cold figure out fast how it works. Edit: although it was logged in with Google Play, it did not back up my progress, lost everything.",
            "Awesome app!! Put off paying for the upgrade for a while but was worth it. What I like most is the calculation of time and money spent or saved...keeps me recording my slip ups and makes it so much more than just a clock. The calendar view is also really cool",
            "Really helps. In the past I've tried to quit smoking and bought a little $1 cigar to 'tide me over'... I always ended up returning to smoking. But I didn't this time because I didn't want to reset my progress. It really helps to see it. One week, no smokes for me!"

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

Twilight may be a solution for you!\r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\r\n\r\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..\r\n\r\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day.

            "I love this app. I get massive migraines and become very sensitive to light, but my phone is the only device I can keep using as long as this app is on. It allows me to play my games or read my online books to try to relax when in the midst of a migraine. Definitely the first thing I install on a new phone! Thank you so much for creating this!",
            "The first time I installed the app, I didn't understand how to manage the settings and I rushed and uninstall it. It's after some months I took out my time to carefully go through it and realized that it is one of the best screen filtering apps. I salute the developers of this app and wish you more wisdom to create more better apps for the world.",
            "Wonderful app. Easy to use. Great for those of us who get up for 30 min in middle of night before going back to sleep. Sure beats staring at ceiling for hours. The relaxing red dust storm tone is peaceful when you inevitably check your phone. Also great for going to bed as you set dimmer and brighter times. Also great for whatever went beep in the night on your phone that you don't get hit with the searchlight that iluminates your skull till your ears glow.",
            "This actually helped me go to sleep ! Im shook! My problem is...first off theres settings that im totally not comftable with nor understand. Also the whole time i was using it.. I was getting warnings of battery being used way to much & it was! Also it was using my data! To much of it! Im gonna try a different one. 😔",
            "I've used this app for over 2 years. I really like it for using my phone in the evening, and I have a small child who's often up in the night and so it's great to have the settings for nighttime use when I'm up with her. Very customisable. Highly recommend."

        "version": "5.1.4",
        "recentChanges": "Meet the new generation of Replika avatars! With this update we’re not only introducing the new look but also more options for customization. Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Awesome concept. Recommend to all my friends. Feedback: (1)Be able to edit/remove power-ups. For example: \"playing with my cat that is no longer alive for 10mins\" is triggering to see. (2)Allow multiple resilience slots for quests and power-ups. Example: \"having a hard conversation\" is both good for emotional & mental. (3)More variety of completion music. The fanfare is annoying. (4)More artwork & personalized avatars. It helps our imagination and reward centre when we see our imaginary selves.",
            "Cute, and great for people who want to improve something but may struggle with motivation. Everything is pretty well detailed and explained, and even the science behind it, but in a way that's not overwhelming at all. Honestly I'm amazed.",
            "This app is everything. I first found it a few years bc of Mcgonigal's TED talk and now, after finishing up my psychology degree, it's the first thing I reach for to get me through, well, everything. Brilliant design to gamify your life/sanity.",
            "The gamification works really well as a concept but the execution really needs work. Obvious bugs like not calculating user's resilience points correctly really destroys user experience. Hope you guys will fix the app soon.",
            "Pushing people to register and without Google plug, will give you pretty good bounce rate..why I suppose register if I don't know if I will like it. People only register if they have clear need, or they know the app already so they are inspired to do it."

            "I wish there was a way to mark specific mediations as \"complete\" - a lot of the time when I finish a meditation it doesn't record that I've completed it. For some reason the only way to mark a segment ad complete is by going back and playing through the entire thing again, skipping using 15s button until I get to the end. Maybe it's because I end it 5 seconds early or something, but I wish there was a way I could like hold down on the segment and say \"mark as complete\" or something.",
            "Very nice app, organized and stylish app. But i wont put my card and pay premium for 78₺. I can buy a trip tick with 80 ₺ to go to nice and relaxing place. I dont trust these app bc i dont know there's hidden messages behind the audios. I install it to see if it is good or not. To see the prices are high or not. For Nature is free to hear all types of sounds. for an app, you have to pay to hear all types of sounds. *i can record all sound i want and add it in one record and its free.",
            "I enjoyed this app at the beginning. However now I find that there is too much guidance and no long sessions. The voice is asking to do something e.g. imagine, remember certain situations but it does not pause to do so, which rises irritation. I regret that I bought a subscription, which is very expensive compared to other meditation apps",
            "You can't do much If you don't get premium and to get a free trial of premium you need to put in your card details and I don't what to do that. Just trying to find one thing that's free give me so much stress that there is no point and just to get a free app like this. I just wish that there where more things on this app that where free so I don't have to get premium",
            "As a beginner i found delightful to be conducted into meditation and awareness by the app. Even though I didn't had the money to pay for all practices I've went through the free ones until I found a way to put in my monthly expenses. Life changer, recommend both as a free and premium user."

It is easy to meet a lie on the streets, in shops or while watching morning breaking news on TV. \r\n\r\nWhy do people lie?\r\n\r\nEverybody has their own reasons. Politicians hire consultants to help them look honest and sincere. But sometimes even the most reliable people lie. The reasons can be different. Our application about body language “Trick me” will help you understand more about the reasons and signs of lie.\r\n\r\n✓Scientists suppose every human lies up to 20 times per day and often they don’t even realize it. This app will help you better understand yourself through teaching you non-verbal actions.\r\n\r\nWhat does your partner really think about?\r\n\r\nNowadays some professionals use lie detector (polygraph) for recognition of deception. Unfortunately, you can’t take a polygraph at the date with your beloved and it also would be odd to use it  with your business partners. Even in relationships between parents and children this device looks inappropriate. And even more - it’s accuracy, according to some resources, is under 80%.\r\n\r\nWhich signs can reveal a lie?\r\n\r\nSometimes ignorance is a bliss. Are you sure you really want to know when people lie to you? Even your closest ones. Using knowledge of body language you can find out more about people in your environment. Do you know that 98% of teenagers lie to their parents and 80% of people tell the white lie every day? Lie theory is a very wide topic, but you should just accept this fact - everybody lies.\r\n\r\nThe methods from this application “Lie to me\" are used in a lot of spheres: police, security services, psychiatric consultants, NLPrs and so on.\r\n\r\nThis app is useful for head managers, scholars, students and everybody who wants to be knowledgeable about psychology of lying and better understand people.\r\n\r\nA person thinks and talks using his/her whole body. For recognition  signs of lie in this application we use a lot of kinds of body language, like:\r\n\r\n★ Gaze direction\r\n★ Touching of lips\r\n★ Types of handshakes\r\n★ Position of legs\r\n★ Lie by telephone\r\n\r\nSince olden times people have had a desire to know what was on someone’s mind. After a while the whole direction has formed. Now it is known as physiognomy. Using this app “Lie to me” you will learn the language of body and gestures. You will find out the main principles of way of thinking and it will be easy for you to recognize a liar by his facial expression. \r\n\r\nSome specialists testify that absolutely every human being can learn how to spot a lie.\r\nYou just have to understand the body language. Yes, it’s true! Very soon it’ll be easy for you to read people’s minds and microexpressions. In a while you will take the gasp of non-verbal communication. Unfortunately or, vise versa, hopefully there are no absolutely verified ways to uncover the deception. But due to this app you will be able to understand people, build close relationships and learn to control your own emotions. If you often deal with public speaking or are engaged in negotiations, it will totally help you to win round the audience. Besides, it will contribute to your personal advancement.\r\n\r\nIt is not always possible to use the body language. Sometimes you don’t have a possibility to observe hands or legs of a person you speak to. For example, if you’re sitting at the table in mental room or moving on the bus - there is still a possibility to reveal deception by your partner’s eyes. But still we recommend to consider all available signs altogether, noticing the environment and context, because some signs of lie could have easier explanation.

            "This app is absolutely one of the most satisfying and beautifully interactive works of art I've ever seen. Each different display interacts with your touch differently, and often in ways you wouldn't expect. So pleasing and calming, and the ad breaks are much more reasonably paced. I'd rather it higher if I could, and I thank the creator(s) and anyone involved in the production of this wonderful app.",
            "Great app for relaxing. I love being able to listen to the soothing music and playing around with the different configurations. Ads aren't too frequent or overly annoying, although I would prefer a paid option and hope the developer creates one. Also, I'd like for there to be multicolor options in the future. Otherwise, fantastic work - highly recommend trying this one out if you need some stress relief!",
            "Love it, but is there no way to pay for an ad-free version? Also, it'd be nice if it would cycle back to the beginning when you reach the end. And is the one that says tangle messed up? The bottom of the letter g looks like it got cut off, or is the letter in a different font. Still love the app and highly recommend it for anyone looking to de-stress... Reply to dev: Awesome and thanks for the quick replies! Edit:this is just an redo of my review from a year ago. You said the same thing then. :/",
            "The app is great.it is just so satisfiying .but my problem is that there are not that many levels. Yes some people will think that I am mad because there are many levels but when you get to the end you will also think that it's not that many levels . So please add more levels and if we ignore it the app is so fun and great . Thanks for making such a fun app but please add more levels.Thanks",
            "I appreciate the calm this app gives me. Very mesmerizing. You should be able to set this up like light therapy. With some very nice background music. Maybe a clock on top. So nice music, a clock/day,date, random scrolling, playlist kind of thing with creators effects...all perfect for your phone on the nightstand on its kickstand, right? I know, I'm asking alot, I wish I could write code. Thanks for listening"

        "description": "SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.\r\n\r\nStep 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. \r\n\r\nStep 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.\r\n\r\nStep 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. \r\n\r\nStep 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?\r\n\r\nUsing SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.\r\n\r\nLearn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. \r\n\r\nThank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC.

            "I downloaded this app when it first came out. Ive had no problems with it and it doesn't drain my battery. I truly wish more people would download it, just for the simple fact that it can help each other stay safe. At first I was worried that this was some type of government tracking devise, but it's not, thank God! I truly believe our NC health department is trying to help us remain healthy and I truly appreciate the effort. So far, I've not been in contact with anyone positive and Im thankful!",
            "Little to no impact on my phone performance and battery life. Appears to work as described, but many more people in North Carolina need to install this app. This app can help to slow the spread of Covid-19 by alerting you to early possible exposure to someone who tested positive. This app needs to be promoted more prominently on social media so people will know it's available. I found it by chance on the Google Play app.",
            "I installed it on my Samsung S5 (6.0.1 Marshmallow). I guess it's working, but it has a big flaw: it's a power hog. Until I installed SowCOVIDNC, my phone battery easily lasted a full day. Now I have to recharge by late-afternoon. That's a big problem. Can you please fix it? I'm not going to uninstall it, because it is important. I can live with the power drain, if I have to. But it sure would be a lot better if it didn't drain the battery so rapidly.",
            "Can't enable the app. I downloaded the app then I read how it works then I clicked enable. However it says that there's an internal error and that I should try again. I try again and it keeps saying internal error. It doesn't tell me anything what the problem is. Using a Samsung Galaxy A20 android phone. Would be thankful for any help. Will be checking back. Edit: Thank you for responding. What you told me to do helped tremendously. It works perfectly now.",
            "Excellent and Thank You! I agree with other reviewers, I hope (and will do my part) it is downloaded by as many NC residents as possible. Also - Google's category of \"Health and Fitness\" doesn't apply they need to create a specific Public Safety or Pandemic Level Category, because this app should NOT get bulked in with thousands of fitness and weight trackers and is likely getting lost in the search. Apps like this is essential to keeping us safe, it needs its own Category. Thank you again!"

I personally beleive the \"cardio\" helps to link still intact hair cells in the ear to synapse nerves that may have been damaged. Definately worth the 2 week trial. Use it everyday, at least one hour per day. You should see a good result!",

Admittedly I wasnt using it everyday, but even 4/5 days a weeks ended up helping my hearing. Def worth a shot and there's a free trial too. Hoping this keeps improving my hearing.",

            "I really like this app. It shows how long it's been since my last cigarette. It also allows you to reset on the day and time you last smoked. It shows how much you saved and it tells you how many cigarettes you could of smoked but didn't. It's really helping me quit. Only the 2nd day but it's going good.",
            "I really like the app for what it is. Although, I wish I could pause it? Most of us will try and retry a couple times, and the app seems to not account for even one cigarette. If I slip up, you gotta give me five minutes (at least) to light one up before the timer restarts. I'm just asking for two separate buttons - a \"stop timer\" and a \"restart timer\".",
            "Ads aren't annoying, the interface is very straightforward, and its already helping me cut back. 4 stars because i wish there was a way to track ongoing progress instead of just how long you've been cold turkey. Like, a log of the last 10 resets on the timer would be awesome.",
            "User friendly. The important statistics are there. However i would suggest to enter an average price for the cigarettes. As a smoker for 15 years, I didn't bought the pack at the same price. For now i pay 5 euros but when i started it was around 2 so the total amount is definitely lower. Great app!!",
            "Terrific App..has helped significantly.However, would be so much better if there was a section included for Nicotine Replacement Therapy as this is what I'm using at present to quit... The timing can't be changed eg.. It was approximately 5pm when I downloaded this app.. I actually had last cigarette at 2pm..but it counted from the time of download...can't go back to change the time.wont allow.. Also when price change of smokes rise, the app won't acknowledge it...hmmm.."

The update that just came out in Oct. 2020 has caused some growing pains as new features are integrated and kinks are ironed out, but the dev team seems to be working hard to fix issues asap. I see no reason for the hissy fits some people are throwing about slight delays in waiting for the app stores to approve the updates. Very glad I got this app!",
            "I loved the old version but the new version I just downloaded on the 10/22/20 is very confusing. For example it says I go to bed at 2100 and wake up to eat at 2330? I am having a really hard time with this.",

Pls download this app is good for kids and it's so much fun! If I were able to I would give this a 10/10! I'll change my mind if the game isn't that good and my rating.",

            "I've used this for a few weeks. I made a custom sound that reminds me of sleeping outside on our back lawn growing up... the flow of a large irrigation ditch and crickets. With the timer feature, it is almost perfect. If I could add an occasional frog, that would be perfect. The frog on the app is too repetitive. OCCASIONAL is missing. If the city, not the country is your thing, this app has that, too. Using free version.",
            "This app is very straightforward and easy to get started. The sounds are pleasant/relaxing and are accompaniedwith nice visuals. There are lots of options and it is fun to mix and customize different sounds. The visual design is gorgeous and beautiful with the use of cool nightly colors. (Gradients can be hard to pull off but you guys made everything so beautiful and easy to read bravo!!!) I am excited to use this more in my daily life to help me relax and get away from the rustle and bustle.",
            "In using this app for 5 minutes after installing it \"I was hooked!\" The amount of control you have over what weird variations that make us individuales are all found here. I was able to completely customize what, \"I need to sleep.\", here and be very specific in my wants and needs. I highly recomend it if you're used to falling asleep with the TV on like I do. I usually wake up as soon as the TV shuts off. I like the timer on this app as I somtimes need to have something running while I sleep.",
            "By far the best app for sleeping, you can customize everything to suit what helps you sleep. There are so many options to chose and you can individually turn volume up or down. I downloaded a few apps like this and i didnt even bother checking them out, i just uninstalled all of them and kept this one. Thanks for the great app, the rain is the only sound that helps me sleep and the added customized features help even more. Ive only used it for 2 minutes and i love it!",
            "Wonderful, especially being able to make custom sound mixes. Even my dogs and cats sleep better with the sounds playing! Some sounds in mixes seem to delay going on and sometimes don't go on at all. This may be sue to available bandwidth or something else (?) Like that it plays even while net surfing! Excellent, very useful, healthy app much needed in these stressful times. THANK YOU!"

            "it seems okay on the surface, and the questions are pretty basic the only problem I see is the phrasing on the page before you start answering questions. it describes autism as a scale. the issue with this is that it makes autism seem more like a step ladder (as if someone can be \"a bit autistic\" or \"very autistic\") when really, the whole \"high/low functioning\" idea only describes how much people mask, which is incredibly harmful to their mental health.",
            "Why can't you put \"?\" for don't understand or it opens up and you can check the check box and or other: write what you mean but allow lots of room, also in the left corner you can push give feedback. And remember you need to make it word like it's for a small child that needs to understand, because that's my comprehension level 🤔.",
            "Am aware that an evaluation through a psychologist is fundamental for proper diagnosis, yet this app gives you a good idea if you in the spectrum or not. I have been obsessed with numbers, patterns and memorizing items since early childhood and found other little quirks along the way as I got older. This test gives me a rating of 33 percent and I see a good bit of truth in that. Thank you. I have shared it with many of my friends and the results are quite amazing and spot on.",
            "The app design is quite nice and technically it works well. However, the contents are really quite... stereotypical. I think they're stupid. It might as well straight up ask me 'Do you think that you have autism?'. Not every autistic person hates socialising. Not every autistic person loves numbers, dates and patterns. Not every aspie or autist struggle with imagination, reading others or planning. It gave me an average score - A group of real psychologists gave me an ASD (and ADD) diagnosis.",
            "Good test, but the interpretation of the result is just bad statistics. Look up the prosecutor's paradox. -- Thanks for the reply...  The app itself is fine... but the fact of making an app that offers this kind of test is gonna get you 1 star from me... sorry!  It's actually not a guide at all, since the probability of you being autistic is very low no matter what you score.  The only solid interpretation is that if you score like a \"neurotypical\" then you probably are one.  So maybe it should be called the Awesomely Neurotypical Test.  The result of tests that make people think they might be autistic is: 1) they clog up the GP and AMH with people who are clearly not autistic, making it even more difficult for adults with ASD to get diagnosed 2) the make people think that \"we're all on the spectrum\", which belittles the suffering that ASD causes.  So, yeah... 1 star."

I really like I can choose the length of the meditation. Shorter one if I'm busy, longer one if flexible with my time. Thank you. Ps: but I really like one particular meditation Surrender (I think it's its title) but it's unavailable now. I needed to uninstall and download the app again and that particular meditation is gone.",

When I first tried this app, I did the \"Dream Meditation\" and then the \"Wash Away Your Pain.\" I think just doing those two, while fully immersed, stimulated a lot that I had repressed throughout my life and wasn't expressing, as I had a very bizzare,Vivid, Nightmare,ButIWasSleepingTheBestIEverHave! IThinkUsingThisAppWillHelpRenewMyselfAsAPersonToTrulyWorkThruMyTroubles",
            "This app has helped me to envision my thoughts, awaken spiritual potential and most importantly taught me how to spend time with my self. I started as a complete beginner and the progress is definitely visible. I've also tried many other mediation apps but the voice coaches in let's meditate suit me the best. This app is is a definite go-to for anyone looking to start in the field of meditation or a veteran. Namaste ;)",
            "Just what I was looking for, simple to use, great selections and works amazingly well! Never had any problems using the app and I just love it! Although there are more female voice then male voice which I hope in the future of this app to have more male voice just because of the soothing softer voice they have then a female voice. But overall a really great app, please give it a try!"

Also can add collaborators to read or add info to crate this awesome experience! Online baby photo book that backs up. Baby 101 info or searchable reading info that shows the source info so you can be assured that it's reliable stuff. Also baby quizzes so you can test your knowledge. Total 1 stop shop.",
            "We loved this app for our first child. However, our new baby is 3 weeks old and I have not been able to add my husband as a collaborator, so it's kind of useless until I can. The email that he receives appears to have a link that says \"Accept Invite\". However, it's not clickable. Is there another way for him to accept my invite to be added as a collaborator?",
            "I like the tracking options but I would not suggest this app to anyone. I am a nanny and have 2 babies to take care of. Half the time the app lags or doesn't save my information I put in. It is SOOOO frustrating and a waste of my time away from the babies to literally re-input 1/4 of what I already typed in. I've been using it for 10 months and I'm switching because it gets me so frustrated.",
            "this app initially worked well, but once we had over 1,000 photos for our first child and we added our second child we started having tons of issues. not worth the frustration. we are moving to a different app because of all the issues. I did like the little weekly and monthly informational bites."

            "Great app. Has helped me through alot of tough situations. Although, i dont have any option to look at the replies on social cloud so i would like to know how so that i can know what other people have to say.",
            "The app’s self-help approach is similar to apps that help people lose weight. Tracking progress is simple and straightforward. The tools the app uses to relieve anxiety are varied and appropriate to a variety of people. The app divides tools into different categories based on either active or reflective approaches, depending on a user’s preferences. All this combines with a colorful, almost whimsical user interface that is simultaneously easy to navigate and visually appealing and calming.",
            "Tried using this app again since my last review hoping that it was my WiFi messing up or the app was having a bad day, nope. When I try to create an account for the forums it won't let me. Keeps on saying 'check your connection'. Can't make an account or login. Hopeless.",
            "Nice app and very helpful , But chat cloud needs an option added to notify us when a user responds to our posts and also a private PM section for those who wish to contact each other , Please can this be added asap it would be most helpful.",
            "Not good. App is designed for less than android 10. Error \"this was made for older version\". Tried to contact by email. Email was auto-returned"

These mental disorders and illnesses range from very mild mood disorders to extreme manic depressive illnesses.

Someone who is beginning to show signs of or is currently suffering from a mental disorder or mental illness may have a dazed look, or lose concentration easily when carrying out regular daily activities. Granted, being able to recognize the physical symptoms of a mental patient may be difficult at first, but once one sees that their friend or family member is making such physical changes, he or she will find it gradually easier to recognize such conditions.\r\n\r\nHaving a withdrawn behavior and \"lonely\" attitude are some of the more important mental illness symptoms that need to be looked out for by family members and friends. Withdrawing from family life and social activities that had been previously enjoyed by the individual is one such symptom. It is almost always exhibited by individuals who are feeling depressed, have mood disorders, suffer from schizophrenia, social anxiety disorders, and many other types of mental illnesses.\r\n\r\nSome other common symptoms of mental illnesses are irritability and unprovoked anger. If you are living with a family member that has a mental disorder, or believe that you may be suffering from one yourself, then you may have already experienced such behavior. Someone who is suffering from a mental disorder may be easily angered, yell for no apparent reason, and appear more irritable in general.\r\n\r\nIt is important to identify and monitor the above mentioned mental illness symptoms in order to obtain good professional help. Contacting a mental health center or a psychiatrist is a great way to get help because they can prescribe various treatment options for the specific mental illness that one is suffering from. For example, prescription medications like anti-depressant medications may be required, and those medications can be combined with counseling and behavior modification therapy. In addition, mental health professionals often extend their services to family members who live with the individual suffering from a severe mental disorder. These services often include family therapy and counseling that benefits all. Multiple solutions and coping mechanisms can be shared and used through such counseling and psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, dealing with a mental illness definitely is not easy as it requires a lot of patience and perseverance. However, by using the proper treatment for the diagnosed mental disorder and seeking help from the professionals, the symptoms of these major mental illnesses can be treated effectively.

I cant even remove the recommended lesson. If I wanted another lesson, I would search for it myself. I can't save my lessons :/",

For example, i need boost my brain in the morning but i don't like the Beta Wave melody... very much. plus, the quality of the pics isn't good which is a lil bit annoying too. but it'd be even better if there were a video or gif instead of photo. anyway, your beats don't hurt my poor ears just like other similar apps do. thank you",

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "Glad I purchased the Premium. Couple of feedbacks and preferences I've noticed since using this for a few weeks now. I wish there was a better way to construct different and multiple playlists. I have multiple playlists for very diff topics. Sometimes I wish I could play all of them while I sleep. Sometimes I wish I can play some. But it's designed to only play 1 playlist, and you can't modify it without changing the name of the affirmation altogether.",
            "I love the concept for the app, however, there are a handful of small usability issues that become really annoying the more you use the app. 1) No filter or search on affirmation record screen 2) No way to select multiple hashtag playlist for playback 3) No integrated way to stream own music while listening to affirmations. Dropping music vol in thinkup and opening other app causes affirmations to not be loud enough. Still like it a lot, though.",
            "*Edit: THIS APP DOESN'T WORK ON MORE THAN ONE DEVICE. There is no \"restore purchase\" option on my second phone when I download the app, because it DOES recognize that I've already got the premium plan. However, none of my recordings are there. I would have to re-record everything to use this on my other phone.This is a fatal flaw. Can you please fix this so the app can be used on multiple devices?",
            "I like that I can record my affirmations in my own voice. There are a lot of affirmations to choose from and I can edit them to make them personal to me. It would help if there were suggestions given on what background music to use to reach your desired goal. You can also change the level of your voice to the background on the paid version but no guidance is given. Also, the Android version is much cheaper than the one for my iPhone which I thought was weird.",
            "Unfortunately, the Android version isn't fully updated with all the features that the Apple version has. I hope you will update it asap. I bought the Premium version on Android and was dissapointed to see features missing: there is no option to control the speed of the loop of affirmations and there is no Stats tab with statistics about your progress. Such a shame!"

        "description": "Am I Bipolar - Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder that causes periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood. The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30–40 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated with bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nThe causes are not clearly understood, but both environmental and genetic factors play a role. Many genes of small effect contribute to risk. Environmental risk factors include a history of childhood abuse and long-term stress. About 85% of the risk is attributed to genetics. The condition is classified as bipolar I disorder if there has been at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes, and as bipolar II disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no manic episodes) and one major depressive episode. In those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration, the condition cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed. If the symptoms are due to drugs or medical problems, it is classified separately. Other conditions that may present similarly include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia and substance use disorder as well as a number of medical conditions. Medical testing is not required for a diagnosis, though blood tests or medical imaging can be done to rule out other problems.\r\n\r\nInstall Am I Bipolar app and learn more.",

And also, in the levels, there is a option \" Enter \" which isn't working. Everytime I tap, it displays ❎. I request the producers to improve these problems. But it must be mentioned that this is an excellent game. There are tricky puzzles to play and pinch your brain and there are thousands of brain teasers. I do recommend this app to all customers. Thank you.",

You don't always have to click the Light Bulb icon. The questions will get harder, and harder. Btw I love this app <3 Keep up the good work!!",

No. Just no."

The app has offerings to help navigate the tumultuous currents we're all swimming in right now. And, I think, going forward it will help us as we try to decide what we want the next, new normal, to look like in our lives. I just started using it and already don't know how I did without it."

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

Even better, even though there is a premium version, it doesn't shove it in front of your face every two seconds, and I can even have it playing in the background or when my phone's screen is dormant. This is a totally great app, and I highly recommend it!",
            "I have enjoyed this app. I have tried many of the free sleep apps. This one offers plenty of free options with less ads then others. I also cannot detect any repetition or glitches which is super important--I'll lose focus in my reading or wake up. I use the sounds for both sleeping and reading focus.",
            "I simply can not function without white noise. I've used a fan in my room for decades. There were years where I used 2 fans for the extra white noise. Without white noise I am unable to do the simplest things like using a tablet to write reviews on apps, watch television, to walk across the room, even to breathe. Forget about sex! This app is the panacea to all of humanity's problems and even to problems I didn't know I had. This app brought me back to life and solved centuries of problems.",
            "A must app to have. Since using my sleep has improved massively. Also a great noise blocker for those who may need it. I love this app and have it going all night with minimal impact to my devices battery life. If you struggle to get sleep, you must try this.",
            "Used it for over a year. I use the \"air cabin\" noise because it sounds the most natural to block out other background noise. Your brain gets used to it quick. Ive used it to block out the sound of my housemates and its massively improved my sleep."

The biggest issue that I have with it is that it occasionally reverts back to metric units even though I've set it for US Imperial several times already. It's frustrating to have to keep changing the settings. Why does it do this? I own the blood pressure monitor, blood glucose and on its way is the activity tracker watch. Please fix this problem as I'm invested in the products. Thanks.",

Tried to log back in and it said user name/password incorrect. Tried the forgotten password link and it comes up with error 404 server not found. I've now no way of getting back into my account and retrieving my data. UPDATE: Just tried one more time logging in with original email and password and I'm in 🤷‍♀️",

I wish you would fix it. You really need to update your app for the galaxy s8 phone. As it,is I can no longer use it !!!! IF IT would work I'd give it a five star rating",
            "The default volume setting is 100% with no option available to change that setting. So when you turn on the sounds, your ears are getting blasted with a dangerous decibel level. Given you're supposed to listen to binaural beats with headphones, this will end up damaging someone's hearing. Immediate uninstall here!",
            "My favorite meditation, music, frequency app. The offerings are the best variety I've seen and I like the customizations you can make to the sound levels in the selfeggio frequency section. You can add in sound elements, like Om, singing bowl strikes, nature sounds and adjust the level of those layers as well. I just purchased the premium and I'm looking forward to exploring everything premium has to offer. Thanks!",
            "Stuttering playback especially on 432 Tibetan, very distracting and unpleasant, after last update it seems to have vastly improved the stuttering, so I have changed my star rating to represent the changes. Some tracks still click and crackle but perhaps that is because my phone. Only problem is that I keep getting notifications to pay for things when I already paid for premium.",
            "I'm not sure what's going on but ever since they did this last update everything is staticky. It don't even have the same effect and it doesn't even sound the same. I don't think that's a good thing considering you have to pay for a membershipand I feel like I'm not getting the most out of that membership now. I might be uninstalling this."

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

            "this is perfect for my misophonia when i sleep! ive always had issues getting to sleep if i plug in my music to drown out my neighbour's tv at night, but this app has taken a major stress of my shoulders. it doesnt even have to be loud for it to work on me, which is extra helpful for my misophonia. my favourite is the thunderstorm and rain :)",
            "I've used this app for years-- I'm almost completely dependent on \"brown noise\" to sleep. But lately it will stop in the middle of the night, which always wakes me up, and I'm not able to go back to sleep. Huge disappointment.",
            "Ive used this app for quite a while and i love the combination sounds but am giving it up because it occasionally stops and then restarts. This will jar me out of a deep sleep and as i have sleep problems in general it often results in a sleepless night.",
            "10/10 Would DEFINITELY recommend. This app is just awesome. It has never tried to flood me with ads and it's useful for when I sleep somewhere where I don't have access to sound."

So if your left eye is better, you can remember the sequence first, then use you memory to see better same characters for right eye. Also it gives very different scores for different test. Overall considering so many design flows I do not recommend using this app at all.",

I tried the regular test with glasses on and had 100% vision in both eyes which tell me me my glasses are the right strength. Also the test to see if you have a stigmatism isn't right. It said I have a stigmatism in both eyes and my Son got the same result when he has 20/10 vision which is even better than 20/20 vision!"

Uninstalled, reinstalled, every time I try to open, an error pops up \"how we feel keeps stopping\" I had started getting warning that it was causing high battery consumption so maybe for the best. Entered it faithfully for 6+ months but can't enter data when it won't open. We had a good run. galaxy S8",
            "The \"update\" has failed miserably! I can't even open the App, it either flashes a blue screen OR an error message. I've sent feedback @ least 3x, with no reply back. I've uninstalled & reinstalled, & I've shut my phone off & on, nothing helps! Something similar happened in Sept too, although when I reinstalled the App after over 100 check in's it started back over at 1 as if I was new to the site. Hopefully you'll get this taken care of ASAP or like everyone else, I'm going to have 2 uninstall.",
            "Well, it's about 7 months, and over 180 posts after my first review. The app won't open for me, it just bounces right back to the home screen. I'm sad about this, but it's been happening for a couple of weeks now. The developers should update, or fix whatever is going wrong.",
            "App WAS a good tool, but after almost 190 days, it no longer opens and keeps throwing error messages throughout the day. I've appreciated the tracking for the past several months, but it looks like it's time to uninstall.",
            "Since the latest update, this app does not start at all,l in my Galaxy S20 Ultra... crashes immediately. Dev should ( in my opin) roll back update until a stable Android update is available if they want to keep collecting free data."

        "description": "Simple, relaxing, endless game. People love it!\r\n\r\n∞ Infinity Loop is a fun way of increasing your logic skills. It can be considered a puzzle game about creating intricate looping patterns or just the application of using a simple concept: \"connecting multiple things\" and make fun out of it.\r\n\r\nSome people say this game is a good puzzle game but with a great zen mode. The goal is to clear your mind, remove the stress from your daily life without any pressure or tension to solve the levels. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a stress relief or a relaxing game type, enjoy the loop!\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\nHow to Play Infinity Loop?\r\n\r\nConnect all the lines and corners to make perfect connections. It is like killing chaos and reaching perfection. Watch the video to overview how it works. Check on youtube as well where several people post the solutions. Nonetheless, we suggest you to try to find yourself how the game works and what are you supposed to do.\r\n\r\nHow to Play the Infinity Dark Mode?\r\n\r\nThe goal of the dark mode is to make disconnections, breaking it all and not leaving a single piece connected.\r\n\r\nHow many levels the game has?\r\n\r\nInfinite.\r\n\r\nHow can I save my game progress?\r\n\r\nMake sure you connect the app with Google Play Games on the settings panel (the button is in the bottom of the gameplay). This way your progress won't be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.\r\n\r\nDo I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?\r\n\r\nNo. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. \r\n\r\nI don't feel the game is challenging. Why?\r\n\r\nThe challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now. \r\n\r\nNote: This game is also available on Android Wear and Android Watches. And it's very fun as well!",

            "Gameplay is beautifully simple, fun, and above all else, relaxing. This game was doing so well at being a calming game with super great sound design and music. This, however, was conpletely ruined by specific ads. I'm all for free games having ads, but if you are marketing a chill relaxing game with good music, maybe blacklist certain ads. It's fine to have popups or quiet videos, but if i'm trying to relax and out of nowhere it goes \"AUDIBLE\" at the top of their lungs, its very jarring.",
            "Played it years ago as a way to kill time, reinstalled again recently. Still as good as I remembered it. Not much changed: it's still the same straightforward puzzle game. It has its challenging moments which get rid of the occasional tedium, but overall is fun. I think a good casual way to enjoy it is to finish five to ten sets a day.",
            "Great game! 3 stars because of the ads. Way too many ads. You're in the vibe with the music and all, then an ad kicks in. Come on! I understand you gotta make some money, but the ads kinda kill the mood. How about making a paid version without ads? This is a game I'd pay for.",
            "This game is soooo fun. It helps me with maths and keeps my brain active. It is so rewarding when you get it right. The puzzles progress lovely and I think it is a good simple, but hard game. I would recommend 👍",
            "The most amazing offline game is infinity loop. Game is most favourable for children to develope their brain towards brain games like chess and etc. This game is too funny as well as it has easy levels and some time it has hard levels as well..I like it's hard level loops..💗🎀"

There's so much more you guys can do. I hope you read this review. I'd be willing to pay a few dollars if this app included more. This could be the light version Also, maybe a better tutorial like or like templates , to help the user become more familiar their first time using this app. Thanks- A Real One.",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.

            "I really wanted to love this. I have serious allergies and I love having the widget right on my home screen. But the app is a pain. It won't let me login. I can login on the website, but the app says it's invalid. I tried resetting my password in the app. After inputting my email to reset I get the error \"There was a problem...\". Yeah, no kidding. While I can see the pollen rating for the day with the widget, the rest of the app is useless.",
            "I used to really like this app. Since the Covid pandemic, I feel that this app has missed the accuracy for many months. I've had this app for years and I have never seen this before. Just wish we knew why it's changed so much. If I'm wrong, I apologize, but it just doesn't seem to be the same as it was. Watch the prediction and see how far it is almost every day.",
            "This app is not at all accurate. Its pollen level readings do not jibe with the readings that are given on the local TV weather forecasts, and with most people's allergy symptoms. For example, now in mid October at this location we are having high levels of ragweed and mountain cedar (juniper) pollen, but the app shows the levels as very low, 0.8 or lower. This app not useful.",
            "I have now been able to download and use the app. It works fine. I do wish I did not have to keep going online to get the info everytime I turn off the phone to charge it. Other than this I thank you for making it available.",

            "Used to love this game. Hadn't played in a little while and wanted to play again. Saying the ads are excessive is being kind. The free version didn't used to be like this. It's not even playable anymore and the only way to remove the obnoxious amount of ads is to get the subscription at $2.99/wk. Sadly 'Uninstall' is the best option.",
            "This used to be one of my favorite games. Now they have added a completely excessive amount of ads. After every guess, right or wrong, I get an add. THIS WHOLE GAME HAS JUST BECOME NON-STOP ADDS. I spend more time now watching adds then playing the game. It takes me 3 seconds to make my new guess and type it...but then I get a 45 second long add🤬🤬🤬🤬",
            "I have been playing this a lot lately, it's good fun and addictive. Some of the levels repeat (I just got exact same picture I've had before) but good variety overall. However the addition of ads popping up after guesses is really annoying. I could put up with it for hints or at the end of a level but it's really off-putting now. My other negative would be once you advance in the game you have to scroll all the way down every time. It would be nice to have a way to jump down to where you're at.",
            "An ad after every guess?! What the hell people? I've played this game for quiet a while and have always enjoyed it. Now I'm uninstalling it because that is obnoxious that you feel the need to flood people with ads after every guess. Right or wrong. Doesn't matter. Here's an ad. Oh whats that? Another one? You sure? Its only been one word, but okay. BAM!!!! ANOTHER AD!!!!",
            "Haven't played in a long time and decided to reinstall it. Mad at my self for doing it. There is an ad after each guess making it enjoyable like it use to be. Had to uninstall. Understand having ads but that was way to much."

            "This is a fantastic app for helping you step down a day by day basis. I have cut down from 30 a day 15 already! The only things that I think would make it better is the ability to share the progress chart and maybe the choice of a widgit or notification option to alert you when you can have your next cig according to the programme. I have noticed a few times that I look and see I have another 20 minutes to go but then I'm trying not to clock watch as I get stressed out that way. Thank you!!",
            "Very useful. Helps to control how many cigaretes you smoke at the start. I hope it will help me to quit as well. Notifications works fine for me .You just have to go to settings and change the sound from silence to any sound you want. 5 star because is simple and easy",
            "it's the best anti smoking app i've seen, i downloaded a bunch of others but they all work the same way, by cutting out smoking completely and giving you achievements and stats on how well youre doing, anyone who has tried to quit can tell you this doesnt work. this app reduces the times you smoke gradually making it so much more easy",
            "It is an amazing application that is making me reduce smoking but there is one issue i cannot change the notification tone, i am changing the tone but it still uses the default tone i don't know what to do.",
            "The app itself is helpful. Not pushy or accidentally judgemental like the other quit smoking apps. But the biggest problems are 1) notifications don't seem to work and 2) The super awesome widget (my fav feature) is useless because it doesn't update unless you go into the app, and sometimes not even then. Which kind of makes the widget useless."

Contacting them is useless. The do not care. I figured out if i manually called the number and let it ring a couple of times, not answer this created a message in my inbox and i was able to text. It sucked till i figured this out. Now that i know the game i am happy. On another note. Only use this app with head phones",

I can't dial out or send text messages. I was able to receive a missed call from my boyfriend. And my phone didn't even ring. What the hell this needs to be fixed. We have children at home and if something were to happen. I couldn't even reach anyone but 911. This is not COOL.",

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

Would be cool to have a tab with a list of benefits at each frequency. With a quick web search, they are easy enough to find. Can't find any option to donate to the creators of this app. There's no advertising on the app. Wonder how they are being compensated. I've turned off notifications as one review mentioned adware.",

The notification just disappears.",

EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",

It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",

So if you wanna pay to potentially improve your mental health, then it might be worth upgrading to the premium. However, as it stands, its not worth the download. . . Better to match someone on tinder and spill the beans there, its more populated...",
            "This app has been life changing for me. This is a safe space for anyone to share and read about experiences, both good and painful, that so many of us go through in life. If you feel alone, and need somewhere to vent, to connect in a safe way, this is for you too. I've made some wonderful Wisdo online friends and I'll always be grateful. The mentor sessions have been incredibly helpful each week too. Shout out to Momma Bear, you're a freaking rockstar for caring so much about the community 💜",
            "Used to be really good, but now you can't do anything without spending money. I had the older version when it was free and it really helped my mental health, now, I will be looking at using another app that doesn't prey on like minded people for funding.",
            "This app stands out above others. It has a cosy , homely and comfortable feel to it. You chat and share your troubles.You can help or be helped and you learn a lot of coping skills. It has a wonderful superviser who takes care of you and youre safety. She has a fair , no nonsense approach and acts accordingly to any concerns about members who are not respecting this app . This app is like a trusted friend who is always there for you .",
            "I got this app when it was free and I love it. I've been using it for 3 years now. I can always let it out on this app 🙂"
