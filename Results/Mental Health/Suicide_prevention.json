Whole point of the app is suicide prevention, but the right crisis services just don't exist.'Find help now' page has a list of national 'crisis' resources, but most aren't 24hrs and won't respond immediately. Only 2 actual crisis ones: Samaritans- but I cant it bring myself to do phone call when feeling on edge- and Shout- the most awful service, with response time of over 1 hr.",

            "So grateful to find this app.Had seen posters advertising it Now in a much better place than I was 5 weeks ago (when I tried to end my life) so have managed to get it on my phone. It's going to be an invaluable tool as I move forward....even writing down my own reasons for staying alive has helped me to recognise that I have a lot!....and I can look at that in the dark times. Thank you!",
            "This app is terrific. There is so much content and resources on here. The capability to upload uplifting photos is an instant motivation to avoid suicidal thoughts. There are many resources and actual conversation about suicide - it cements that you are not weird or alone or too far gone. I turn to this app when things get too dark. I will be forever grateful to the creators of Stay Alive. 🙏"

        "description": "How to Talk to a Suicidal Friend\r\nIf you have a friend contemplating suicide, you may be scared and unsure how you can reach out to help them. You may be worried you may say the wrong thing or afraid you can’t handle the responsibility. \r\n\r\nHow to Help a Suicidal Friend\r\nHaving a friend who you believe to be considering suicide is not to be taken lightly. Being suicidal is a temporary state that appears as an answer to severe depression, and the act of taking one's own life is preventable when the correct measures are taken. As a friend, you can potentially save a life by paying attention to warning signs of suicide (in addition to the ones you already know about), making your friend feel supported, and knowing when and how to get outside help. If your friend is in immediate danger call 911, or 1-800-SUICIDE to talk to professionals and access necessary resources.\r\n\r\nHow to Talk Someone out of Suicide\r\nIf someone is considering suicide, your first move should always be to call emergency services, such as dialing 911 or the National Suicide Hotline (1-800-273-TALK) in the US. The two most important things you can do with someone considering suicide are to listen and keep them in your sight at all times. Talking someone out of suicide is a difficult process, and you should always contact professionals to handle this delicate situation.\r\n\r\nHow to Handle a Suicidal Teenager\r\nSuicide is the third leading cause of death for 15-24-year-olds. Girls tend to think about suicide and attempt suicide about twice as often as boys, yet boys die by suicide 4 times more often that girls. Contemplating suicide is a big deal for a teen, and a scary situation for parents. When dealing with a suicidal teen, remain calm and remember that you can handle this.\r\n\r\nHow to Deal with a Suicidal Person\r\n\r\nHow to Help Someone Who Is Thinking About Committing Suicide\r\nIf you have reason to believe that someone you know is contemplating suicide, you should get help immediately. Whether your friend told you they were thinking of suicide or you just sense a possibility, you should act; doing so can save a life. Call the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or the UK Suicide hotline at 116 123 to learn more about how to provide assistance and find local suicide prevention resources.\r\n\r\nHow to Empathize with People Who Have Suicidal Tendencies\r\nOver 800,000 people die due to suicide every year and there are many more who try to attempt it. Having suicidal tendencies is actually a call for help that shouldn’t be ignored by the society. \r\n\r\nHow to Cope when Someone You Care About Is Suicidal\r\n\r\nHow to Help a Suicidal Family Member\r\n\r\nHow to Recover from a Friend's Attempted Suicide\r\nIt can be very emotional and traumatic to learn that a close friend attempted suicide.\r\n\r\nHow to Help a Sibling Who Is Contemplating Suicide\r\nWhen a family member is contemplating suicide, it doesn't just affect the individual. It will take an emotional toll \r\n\r\nHow to Recognize the Warning Signs of Suicide\r\nSuicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, with 37,500 suicides recorded in 2010.\r\n\r\nHow to Break Up With Someone Who Is Threatening Suicide\r\nHow to Help a Suicidal Autistic Person\r\n\r\nHow to Deal with Suicidal Parents\r\nHaving a suicidal parent is a uniquely difficult experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star in addition when you share it with your family and friends.\r\nDo not hesitate to make your comment, suggestion, advice and so on via rrnshams@gmail.com\r\nThank you.",

        "description": "The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\r\n\r\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\r\n\r\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

            "I love this app a lot! I see nothing wrong with it. And it's very creative, when I downloaded this app there was a passcode and if you don't remember it, you may reset it by awnsering a simple question.. I do not remember what I put so I had to uninstall and reinstall but that is my fault 5/5 stars",
            "They responded to my comment VERY fast and made it so that I could use the app again! I love this app because it helps me relieve my stress and keeps me safe. I would recommend this app to anyone who struggles with the urge to self-harm because it works wonders for me. If you struggle with the urge to self-harm, PLEASE consider this app!",
            "The app has an amazing selection of helpful activities, however for some reason it struggles to load up initially, as well as loading up things like the log. I've restarted my phone, force closed the app and reopened it, my next option is reinstalling it but if that doesn't work then I'm forced to try other apps, which may not give me nearly as many options for calming myself down so I don't self harm.",
            "Hiya! I just wanna drop by and thank you for making all these mental health apps. I rarely ever see good mental health apps like this and I'm just so thankful that you guys are doing it. Self harm is a very serious struggle and I'm glad that there's more apps to help with it. I'm espically glad that you are making it free because lots of people can't pay for it and by making free, you guys are helping so many more people. Thank you for helping out and spreading more awareness!!! <3",
            "It's great but could you maybe make a 'hide' function? That would be awesome because a lot of people judge when they see apps like this on my phone. So could you maybe have an option to disguise it, like say a calculator."

You are never asked for your real name and we’ll never disclose your personal information.\r\n• A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY USE THERAPEER?\r\nYou're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.\r\nYes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.\r\nYes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don’t always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.\r\nYes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don’t want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.\r\nBut most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.\r\n\r\nWe get all of that. We get YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n• Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer. By doing so, it will help you deal with your own challenges in a broader perspective and will make you feel better by knowing you helped others in need.\r\n• Already gained the gratification of helping others? Go ahead and create your very own support room (or, if you don't want to wait, we offer the option to purchase a credit to open your room immediately).\r\n• After your private anonymous Support Room is opened, we match you with other Therapeer community members who have struggled with something similar to what you're experiencing.

Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

See if your plan is covered by upgrading in the app and searching for your insurance provider. \r\n\r\nSELF-CARE:  \r\nGet clinically validated techniques to help you manage your moods and thoughts, so you can understand what works for you to feel better. Daily mood tracking, Guided Journeys, coping tools, meditations, and progress assessments help you find relief when you need it and feel better over time.  \r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY:  \r\nFind a fresh perspective in a judgment-free space. Anonymously participate in active discussion boards and chat groups in the Sanvello community, exploring a diverse range of topics from stress relief techniques to words of encouragement and gratitude.

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

It always said \"we can't find this url\" sort of thing. Never got to see the stuff. But after all, I really am amazed by the game, thank you devs! DMLM",

Coming from someone who is very non emotional, the ending just about made me cry. The game developers did such a great job, kudos to them!♥️",

And after 20 messages that just happen all at once, you're back to waiting again (you can watch an ad to skip the wait, but the sheer number of these gets tiring). I'm trying to plow through it hoping maybe something really cool will happen soon to change my mind; there has to be a reason for all the kudos, right? I'll update if that happens."

The only issue I've run into is that when I try to post a forum, it tells me I haven't created an account even when I just logged in. Not sure if it's a problem on my end or theirs",
            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

I feel very lucky, more optimistic creating daily habit of journaling with premium features.. Really love the visuals, simple yet elegant and artistic.. Keep up the good work! I hope I don't have any issues about data backup..",
            "I just downloaded the app and its really good, i really like how you can write all your thoughts and feelings. However, there are some negative things about this app. I wanted to add a passcode to the app so that no one can see all my thoughts and diaries, but it said that i had to pay. I don't think that is fair because i dont have the money to pay and it could be thesame for many other people and keeping your thoughts private on this app should be for free. Other than that, the app is good.",

This is how CBT guided diary works. \r\n\r\nGet to know yourself by diving deeply into your passions, feelings, and life goals.\r\n\r\nMental health is a highly complex machine and sometimes it falls into depression. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) journal comes to help through dozens of effective techniques:\r\n- Mindfulness journaling lets you unwind at the end of the day\r\n- Guided reflection improves mindfulness and teach gratitude\r\n- Mood tracker diary allows keeping track of mood dynamics\r\n- Self care diary serves for learning new ways of thinking and overcoming depression\r\n- Journal itself makes bipolar smoother\r\n\r\nMood tracker diary is here to find out the prerequisites for depression:\r\n- what time of the day causes bad mood\r\n- particular activities responsible for negative thoughts\r\n- ineffective behavior\r\n\r\nMental health apps are often hired for fast check-in as if it had been any helpful in the therapy. Ory - journal app, on the other hand, provides instruments for deep personal transformations as well as anxiety relief.\r\n\r\nGuided journal notebook releases a huge amount of positive energy which is hidden by mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. \r\n\r\nSelf care journaling with Ory consists of these components:\r\n\r\n- Relax and reflect in the diary\r\n- 3 to 10 logs with the mood tracker to obtain the whole mental health picture and identify bipolar\r\n- Development of happiness by following anxiety relief journal prompts\r\n- Listening of meditation and affirmation for good sleep\r\n\r\nMental health wellbeing requires daily impact on it.

It has been stuck on my 3 personal qualities. I stopped using the app for a while and recently got back into it and it is still asking that same question. It is irritating to me.",
            "I like it but there's a couple of bugs with the app. When I'm typing my journal entry, I scroll back up or down to fix a typo and it will take me to the next step (listing victories of the day). One time it did that and it erased everything that I typed. when I select a logged mood/activity, it pulls up the screen for the day. It will say \"no logs.\" I can only view the moods by viewing by week, or viewing a day after the actual day of the mood. For example, a mood on Aug 31 will show on Sept 1",
            "Love this so far, it very much helps to track your mood. Also it makes you think several times about the worst things in your life so that you can make sure they have some positive impact, even the smallest bit. I will be working with this app for more and I hope after some time I would be able to notice some changes in myself!",
            "So far so good. I will review after I've used it longer. Only 2 days so far but I very much like the way it is laid out - one has to stop and really think about one's self and why one feels, thinks, reacts or emotes in certain ways. I would like to know how to go back and look at my past stories. So frustrating!!!",
            "This app is incredible I love the feeling of opening this app and expressing my feeling and how my day went its like you have someone to talk to its amazing I would really recommend this app, I use this every day and wouldnt turn to a different journaling experience."

Thank you for making such a beautiful art. ♡ I still.. collect some money to buy the premium one (haha). I hope it could be great seeing your premium art displayed on my android screen, soon. Stay safe and sound! ✿",

All answers seem to lead to the same thing. In the story some questions the characters ask you it really feels like it's gathering information about you to sell off to advertisers. It asks what your hobbies are etc. I am unsure if this is somehow related to the story later on or not I didn't get very far into it.",

        "description": "Imagine something…\r\nYou're not feeling your best. You might call it stress, anxiety, depression, low mood, or something completely different. What you do know is that you want to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSo where do you begin?\r\n\r\nEnter the world of MoodSpace\r\nMoodSpace brings together techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, positive psychology, and behavioural activation into a self-help space for mental wellbeing to guide you in managing and improving your mental health.\r\nTechniques such as recognising three good things in a gratitude journal and balancing automatic thoughts in the cbt thought record are grounded in decades of research on what makes us happy.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds \r\nNotice life's good moments by writing a delightful three good things in a gratitude journal and note the good things that are all too often forgotten.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds is based on the gratitude journal from Positive Psychotherapy. By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.\r\n\r\nThought Diary \r\nLook at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.\r\n\r\nThe thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.\r\n\r\nGuided Meditation\r\nFocus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds. Cultivating this sense of mindfulness can help prevent rumination and help cope with stress. \r\n\r\nDay Planner\r\nSchedule your time in this activity planner based on what brings you fulfilment. Rediscover what brings you happiness and make the plans that bring those things back into your life. Ensure your life has balance by making plans around work, fun, and rest to help reduce stress.\r\n\r\nAt your fingertips\r\nMoodSpace techniques are designed to be as simple as possible to use.\r\n\r\nThe three good things technique can be used daily to keep track of the little things. And this gratitude journal can be looked back on in the future whenever you're in need of a smile.\r\n\r\nThe thought diary cbt is good to use at a moments notice when a stressful situation occurs. To quickly cope with stress and get back on with your day.\r\n\r\nA wellbeing app driven by the research\r\n\r\nIf you suffer from anxiety or depression, you are far from being alone: It has been estimated that today, there are over 260 million people around the world dealing with depression and 280 million dealing with anxiety. \r\n\r\nMoodSpace takes its techniques from decades of research on what helps in dealing with anxiety and dealing with depression, and brings those techniques to your fingertips.\r\n\r\nThe app aims to create a self-help space where you will have the opportunity to experiment with techniques backed by research to see what works for you. \r\n\r\nUsing this knowledge, we encourage you to carry out your own, further research into your favourite techniques.

Thank you guys!! the new features are also great!!! *I don't know yet how affordable is this app, i fear i won't be able to purchase it after they reintroduce the paying plans. But i am really thankful for this free period, i feel it helps and i really needed a good tool to help me regain balance at this strange, unpredictable time. Thank you! Great and beautiful app! 🙏",

Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced. I try to fill the three clouds when I remember, but I'm not yet regular with it. The Thought Diary function was immensely helpful in a difficult situation. Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",

I'm currently using the free section but helps as have to think and find the positive in the day and why do I think its happend. It helps to re read when going through a rough day and realising that you have more good days if you find the good.",

Really like the rabbit on app icon, It may sound crazy 😄 but every day I remind my self to speak with rabbit, share my thoughts with him and try to stay positive. It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking. Meditations are ok.",

Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them.

Who are they? How can I trust a counselor on the web with my deepest, darkest secrets?\r\n\r\nWe assure you: to become a therapist with us, the experts have to pass rigorous prerequisites and tests. All of our therapists have a degree (at least a master’s, some a PhD) and specialty: psychologists (PsyD/PhD), licensed professional counselors (LPC), clinical social workers (LCSW/LMSW) and marriage and family therapists (MFT). To provide therapy on our app, the experts must have at least 3 years of clinical experience. \r\n\r\nAll of our therapists are qualified by their state board to practice psychology and counseling. While experience and expertise vary, you are guaranteed to find a match. We have specialists on addiction, anxiety, depression and couples therapy; some of our therapists are members of the LGBTQ community, and some specialize in providing therapy to members of the community; others still are more spiritual and religious, and you will be paired with them if you so wish.\r\n\r\nAnd the best part is that after being matched, and seeing for yourself if you connect to your therapy provider – you are free to switch therapists, at any time and at no extra cost – with no inconvenience to yourself. There’s nothing to lose here - give yourself renewed vigor and the power to live. Schedule therapy sessions as much as you need, whenever you need.\r\n\r\nWhat you stand to benefit\r\n\r\nMany problems of the spirit are difficult to face alone. Mental health is a delicate matter, and therapy is a proven way to defeat your demons and turn over a new leaf, of happiness and fulfillment. By turning to therapy on an app, you get rid of many of the difficulties of traditional therapy.\r\n\r\nAnxiety will become a thing of the past, since there’s no need to leave your comfort zone. Consult a knowledgeable, experienced counselor – all from the comfort of your home and at a time you see fit. Depression is often so crippling that getting out of the house, driving to a therapist’s office, and meeting a new therapist in person seems impossible, and thus therapy is dismissed in lieu of an easier solution. That easier solution is here: find solace and reach inner peace, and slowly regain the confidence and life force of your young days.\r\n\r\nLet Your Walls Down\r\n\r\nGet ready – you’re beginning a journey to better yourself. Setting yourself on the path to happiness is never the easy choice, but it is always the healthy choice.

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "Cannot book sessions. No customer support. My therapist was great, but haven't been able to book another session. This issue is not resolved!!!! Took customer support 13 days to get back to me and thier response did not help. I guess I have to wait another 13 days now...who knows? I'm so annoyed by this. I'm just going to cancel my membership - instead of Talkspace helping me with anything it's become another source of frustration in my life. Freakin' worthless.",
            "I submitted a question to customer support 11 days ago and have not gotten a response yet. I want to cancel my account, but there is no button to cancel or deactivate. This app is terrible. The texting feature is one of the major reasons I signed up for Talkspace, but I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth since my therapist does not respond for 8-12 hours. When she does respond, she just says she has some ideas that could help me, but that she will share them during our next session, making me wait several days for any sort of lifeline! I need help now! I'm paying for this service! On another similar therapy app, I was able to message back and forth with my therapist and get instant feedback. As for the video chats, I would have preferred if my therapist would have been stationed in one place the whole time instead of walking around her house. It was a bit unprofessional and even when she was sitting down because she had a tv on somewhere in the house and she was moving the camera all around making me sea sick. To make matters worse, I had no way of knowing if anyone at her house could hear our conversation! She had a lot of experience as a therapist, but admitted that she was new to Talkspace and had not yet read all of the handbook and all the rules she was supposed to follow as a provider. When we got booted out of our video call three times, she suggested that we FaceTime. Again, not professional! Talkspace is a secure platform where mental health information can be shared. FaceTime is not! I'm going back to the other app I was using before. It was slightly more expensive, but wayyyy better!",
            "Do not waste your time or money with this app. My therapist has been really wonderful and responsive, but the app is absolute trash. I reached out to support and the only response I received was, \"We've received your support request, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" That's it. No actual response to my concern. I can't book new sessions because I \"don't have any session credits available\" and there's no obvious/visible way for me to even pay to book another session. To top it off, the sessions that I have booked with my therapist have been such poor quality that I am literally talking to a blank screen because her face never shows up, despite us both having very fast internet connection speeds. I'm really disappointed in the general usability of the app, the complete lack of customer service, and the quality of the calls between me and my therapist.",
            "The issue has been resolved. Thank you! I was charged a total of 8 times in one month and still have not heard back from customer service or been issued a refund. On top of that, the app is still behaving as if i haven't renewed my subscription despite having taken 8 monthly charges out. If customer service ever reaches out and resolves the issue then I will change my rating because I love my therapist, but I dont like being multi-charged for a service I am not receiving.",
            "Received an invite link to this service. The first therapist told us they could not accommodate video sessions, which is what we paid for. The second therapist did not respond to any messages. Talkspace seems unable or unwilling to provide the service we paid for."

Every morning it asks you to take a pledge that you'll stay sober today and every night it asks for the review of the day like how's your mood and others. Also it has a community in which you can read stories of people that are trying to get off the same addiction. Also it gives you a motivational quote everyday. Wonderful Idea.Love this app.",

Only a few issues. 1) Would be nice to be able to change the font color. 2) if there was a way to delete previous themes. 3) ability to add music/videos 4) a way we could create a top 10 list? Songs, movies, actors/actresses, places to visit, childhood memories, etc. It would be a good distraction and as you keep looking at it you may change your mind and change the entries. Just a few ideas I think would be most helpful.",

        "description": "Note: The content in this app were made in the light of psycom.net (a mental health platform). The whole app is intended for fun and education purposes. For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "Horrible game designed by someone who has no respect, empathy, or understanding for people who genuinely experience depression. The game offers nonsensical solutions to generic descriptions of how someone might describe their depression. Figures but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and not only did the game live up to its criticisms but the ads ruin its playability entirely. It's insulting tapping for a hint to see it for a nanosecond before an ad pops up preventing you from reading the hint.",
            "This feels like a soulless cashgrab, made to keep people watching ads. Most of the tasks are so convoluted, that I found myself pressing hint every time. For people with depression, like myself, this app is terrible at helping anyone through it. The people/person responsible for this, has no heart.",
            "Pretty mediocre. One of the puzzles didn't work for me regardless of me doing what the hint said to do, and the barrage of ads on the hints leave a bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes it'll only play an ad and no hint. Sucks because this had potential.",
            "Annoying as hell! Definitely makes me feel trapped like depression, great on that, but anytime i click 'hint' cause i can't get passed, all I'm met with is an ad for 30 seconds and can't read the actual hint that flashes on the screen for like half a milisecond!",
            "Very unique. This game describes how depression feels and i belive thats a great way to show people who dont quite understand how it feels. Each level is seemingly a challange but then agsin depression is as well. Good job compairing it to a puzzle because depression can take a while to figure out and piece together.

The community is very friendly and engaging which is always a bonus, but the app also has an appealing and simple design. There's good customisation options as well as a light/dark mode; there are thoughtful features like adding conversations to favourites and deanonymize requests (which can be turned off).",
            "I love this app. Very great set up and I love how everything is designed around actually being helpful. I've met nothing but kind people who have been very supportive and provided very wise solutions to my problems. If there's one app u would need for getting help to solving issues. This is the one I recommend",

            "A very great app! I spent hours on it to answer the aninymous questions. It feels great to be able to help people who have no one else to talk with. It's also great for when i really need advise and opinion on things, or just to vent about my problems"

I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "Easy to use; accessible and very blind friendly; thank you. It's getting very hard to find an app that isn't overloaded with unlabeled images, buttons, and circular sliders. Thanks for a straight-from-the-hip, getter-done meditation app. You're welcome. I'm really grateful that the reminders are verbal as well. Most apps seem to think that visual reminders are enough, but blind people don't have the luxury of looking at their phones constantly, so thanks for talking to me.",
            "An excellent, totally free mindfulness app. Smiling Mind covers everything from children to teenagers to adult mindfulness foundations, with a variety of specific targeted mindfulness courses of all sorts to help with different areas like sleep, stress, relationships, work - etc. I've been using it for years and it's wonderfully ad free. As for mindfulness itself, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're curious, Smiling Mind is a perfect place to start.",
            "This app is so great when it works. It gets quite glitchy when it comes to member login and member data. It will not let me reset my password because apparently my email address is not present in the system but I am unable to register a new email address because I'm already registered in the system! When I was still able to login it would randomly delete my data and programs/progress. It will also sometimes just freeze in the middle of a meditation.",
            "I like the meditations however I dont like the layout and navigation of the app. A lot of the meditations are too similar, cant skip and have a long intro that I dont want to hear every time. The app logs me out often too and I have to login, which is an annoying inconvenience when I'm trying to relax to sleep. I fell asleep to it and it kept playing the whole night for 8 hours. And just then I was listening and it kept skipping to the beginning. It was rather creepy actually and now I'm on edge",
            "This app is amazing and has helped me to sleep again. I was relying on a number of medications to sleep but the guided mediations have drastically changed that for me. I cannot thank everyone involved in this enough, so I'm going to donate as well. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful tool freely available and without ads, it really has changed my life 😘"

Also the mindfulness section only has 4 things to look at, it would be nice if more were added.",
            "i used clear fear for a while now and im so glad i found it because its really helping. i would give 5 stars if there wasnt this little problem that gets super annoying after while. if you log into the app the first time you answer some questions like selecting which part of the world ur from, set ur passcode and a security question and all of that stuff and i confirmed everything but if i open the app i have to answer all of the questions again, like i havent answered them. please fix that!!",
            "Good app, just two notes. When I try to type a text I cannot scrol the screen down enough to keep seeing the textbox. It disappears behind my keyboard. And I would like some excercises in it that are also in calm harm. It seems that app contains more coping strategies than just cbt and a breathing excercise it also has more interaction than clear fear. But it is a bit weird to read about harm when it is about anxiety. Another option would be to choose in the harm app what one is using it for.",
            "This was an ok app but there are only two things you can do to calm you down. A breathing activity and the same recording of a person telling you how to calm down. Other than that it's just an app to write down goals. There is also no option to record an attack after it happened and instead you must go through one of the activities and say that it helped so that you can record something. Even then it'll not show up for awhile until the week ends. There could be many improvements but its ok.",
            "I was recommended to this application by my therapist, and found the resources in this application helpful. However, I do realise that there is a bug that doesn't save your information when you close out of the application. Therefore, I would have to manually key in all my details from startup again. Other than the issue I mentioned, the application overall is great."

            "I feel like this is a really good app, gives me a little bit of responsibility by waking up my buddy and gets me to go out and do simple but meaningful tasks. It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

And I can freely express my anger without having to hear some useless advices. Overall, this app has helped me in dealing with my slight anger issues.",

The progressive muscle relaxation exercise in other VA apps such as CBT-i coach are much better. I hope this is corrected in a future update.",

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

As a Programmer myself, I would have to say that this has been built very well and so far I haven't experienced any hiccups or software issues with the app. My only gripe, and this is just because I'm frugal, is the pricing of the Premium version. 4.99 just seems a lot to me to unlock basic customization options.",
            "This is the best of the quitting habit trackers I've tried. Nice simple yet classy UI, & adding motivational cards helps remember why I'm doing this. I have used it for ages so upgraded to premium for extra goals. I also like the dark theme. The only thing I would have liked in premium was maybe an added diary or notes, though I still think it was well worth my money.",
            "I expected a bit more features and options, but it's rather good. Good and easy UI, everything is clear and easy, cold figure out fast how it works. Edit: although it was logged in with Google Play, it did not back up my progress, lost everything.",
            "Awesome app!! Put off paying for the upgrade for a while but was worth it. What I like most is the calculation of time and money spent or saved...keeps me recording my slip ups and makes it so much more than just a clock. The calendar view is also really cool",
            "Really helps. In the past I've tried to quit smoking and bought a little $1 cigar to 'tide me over'... I always ended up returning to smoking. But I didn't this time because I didn't want to reset my progress. It really helps to see it. One week, no smokes for me!"

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

It also diagnosed me with something I have never heard of (and now wish I had written down as I have uninstalled the app already) because it was so far off of my personality indicating that I did extreme things to achieve affection and felt useless without their attentions. Very far off ;) just for fun, enjoyed, now done ;)",

            "the test was okay but the instructions are covered by a big continue sign or next so I scored the questions incorrectly and had to take the test over again. they need to remove the sign that covers the instructions on the first home screen. otherwise the test was fine and the results I'm not too sure about",

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

            "Found a pamphlet with this app on it as a PTSD resource at my VA behavioral health clinic nearly a year ago. Checking it out was the best decision (other than treatment) I've made. It provides the ability to schedule regular check-ins with tracking over time and various tools and learning resources for the individual, their family, and their support network. I'm grateful for this app everyday for helping manage my symptoms and maintain regular check ins between psych/therapy appointments.",

            "A great tool for those who have anxiety. The guided meditations are a great help. I highly recommend this application. I have already made a recommendation within our group. This is a must have tool for any PFA toolbox.",

        "description": "Scary true crime stories that will keep you up at night! This is not for the faint of heart. Murder Minute stories are well written and detailed with photos and videos of crime and serial killers. All of our stories are thoroughly researched and 100% true. Our writers are respectful of the victims and do not glorify or condone violence but be warned that some of these stories are very disturbing. \r\n\r\nMaybe you are intrigued by the psychology of serial killers? Or maybe you want to know how they operate so you can make sure you and your loved ones don’t become victims? Murder Minute adjusts to your preferences and contains great stories with uncensored photos and videos for anyone with an interest in true crime.\r\n\r\nSome examples of stories (you will get hooked):\r\n\r\nEdmund Kemper\r\nA 6'9\" tall, 250 pound serial killer with an IQ of 145. Edmund Kemper murdered multiple women in the most gory way possible. He has lately been put in the spotlight after being featured in the TV show Mindhunter.\r\n\r\nThe Sacramento Vampire\r\nRichard Chase had an unquenchable thirst for blood. Literally. He believed Nazis were turning his blood into powder and to survive he had to replace it. To do this he made smoothies of blood, guts and gore.\r\n\r\nBTK: Bind, Torture, Kill\r\nDennis Rader was a married, normal seeming man but he murdered numerous women and children over decades and the people around him didn’t have a clue. He took pictures of himself posing with his victims’ corpses, sometimes wearing masks or bondage outfits... super creepy. He thought himself an evil mastermind but was finally arrested after sending clues to the police.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Junko Furuta\r\nThe cruel torture and murder of a Japanese school girl was so monstrous that it is almost unbelievable. Almost as chilling is the fact that all of her torturers were teenagers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bathory\r\nThe Blood Countess is rumored to have bathed in the blood of hundreds of young girls she had brutally tortured and murdered. Is it as legend state; that she bathed in the blood of virgins to maintain her youth, or is she the innocent victim of a conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther famous (or rather infamous) murderers and cases include:\r\n• Ted Bundy\r\n• Broken Arrow\r\n• Charles Manson\r\n• Pedro Lopez (the monster of the Andes)\r\n• YNW Melly\r\n• The Zodiac Killer\r\n• The Golden State Killer\r\n• The KFC Massacre\r\n• The Shankill Butchers\r\n• John Wayne Gacy (the Killer Clown)\r\n• Charles Cullen (the Angel of Death)\r\n• Carmine Galante (a vicious NY mobster)\r\n• Roy Demeo (a mafia hitman who brutally killed his enemies)\r\n• David Berkowitz (the .44 Caliber Killer)\r\n• Mikhail Popkov (the Werewolf)\r\n• Tsutomu Miyazaki (the anime crazed cannibal known as the Otaku Murderer)\r\n• Luis Garavito (the Beast)\r\n• Richard Ramirez (the Night Stalker)\r\n• The kidnapping of Adam Walsh (one of America’s most high profile child abductions)\r\n• Albert Fish (The boogeyman.

Bring back the old format and the way everything used to look! I'm done with this app! I would give it negative 5 stars if I could!",

            "It is good, but there are still quite a few problems. - Allow recent app switch doesn't work - Using phone wallpaper as background doesn't work - You can sometimes restart your phone and the detox will have stopped, even when you allowed everything that should keep the detox running - You can still uninstall the app if you use an emergency usage - Biggest problem: there was lag and it was taking unusually long for an app to open while in detox, because of this I had to stop my detox.",
            "Accidentally whitelisted the apps that I didn't want to use during my detox. No way to correct this despite what Urbandroid says (settings cannot be accessed while the detox is in progress!) There should be 3x use of emergency existing of the app completely or allow access to settings. You either have to pay or get 2 mins to access your phone(which I wasn't aware of so how could I have known to change this setting before hand) but still can't touch the settings with the allotted breaks.",
            "I only have one problem. I found a very easy way to bypass lock settings for detox schedule. If I set my detox at 10pm , all I need to do is shut down my phone one or two minutes before 10pm, and when I start my phone after 10pm, the schedule detox just doesn't work anymore. I have given all the permissions for autostart, start in background but still it is not working. I really hope you guys fix this problem. Besides that I am very satisfied with this app. Thank you. It has helped me a lot.",
            "It is an awesome app.It is the best of its kind.I like how even after switching off and opening again it is still there.And it has a practical punishmenet for anyone who wamts to quit the detoxifcation.And the quotes that comes on the screen are practical and it gives you an idea. Anyone who wants to detoxify should try this.",
            "Best app ... I have been searching for a perfect app from the past few hrs ... I must say I installed and tried those famous apps with 5M or 1M+ downloads, this is far better. I would recommend it. Give it a try. Thanks to Developers did a good job !! Simple. Clean. Does the job. Required Free features."

            "I love that this teaches mindful, intuitive eating and not dieting/ restricting. It really helps me to slow down and listen to my body. I am very impressed with this app! I also love the meditations 🧘‍♀️",
            "I was looking for an app where I could track macros but not calories. I end up restricting and getting too obsessive. This doesn't track macros but I couldn't care less. It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",
            "Excellent tool. Keep up the exceptional work! It has been very useful to me and made the process very positive. Thank you!"

        "description": "Suicide Silence was founded in 2002 in Riverside, California. At that time, it was a side project consisting of musicians from other bands. Their first live show was performed locally at Riverside, with a line-up consisting of Chris Garza (guitar), Rick Ash (guitar), Mike Bodkins (bass), Josh Goddard (drums) and vocalists Mitch Lucker and Tanner Womack. Despite being fired soon afterwards, Womack's vocals appeared in the 2003 band demo Death Awaits. After Death Awaits finished, the band began recording a second demo, which was released in 2004 and contained the song \"Stand Strong\" with Lucker's vocals instead of Womack's. That's when the band members started doing more time for Suicide Silence. Soon after, they recorded and released their first studio effort; The self-titled EP was released in 2005. Originally released by Third Degree Records, and later released back in the UK via In the Deep End Records. 2006 marks the departure of drummer Josh Goddard, who was replaced by Alex Lopez (former guitarist for Blacheart Eulogy and The Funeral Pyre).\r\n\r\nFollowing this event, the band went to Century Media in 2006 and began working on a third demo, which contained three pre-production songs of what they wanted to include on their long-awaited album called The Cleansing. The album was written, recorded and finished in 2007 and dimixed by Tue Madsen, produced by John Travis and featuring artwork by Dave McKean. The album was released on September 18, 2007 and debuted at number 94 on the Billboard 200, selling 7,250 copies in its first week of release. The week's sales ended in combination with the sale then made The Cleansing one of the best-selling debut albums in Century Media history. With the success of their debut album, Suicide Silence was included to take part in the Mayhem Festival which took place during the summer of 2008. After that, they toured Europe with Parkway Drive and Bury Your Dead, following a successful US tour with the same band. Suicide Silence was followed by a tour in Australia with Parkway Drive, A Day to Remember and The Acacia Strain in mid 2008 when they entered to perform at Sweat Fest. At this point Suicide Silence began to gain a variety of fans around the world. On returning home from an ongoing tour, the band covered the song \"Engine No. 9\" by Deftones and released the cover in the limited edition of Green Monster Single and also iTunes throughout the same year.",

In addition, we have created a Motivation category for lovers of motivational phrases.\r\n\r\nHowever, the real potential of this application is that it allows you to set up a lock screen.

The emotions don't match with the correct day, the time of the entries show only the time you downloaded the report and it doesn't include any of the recorded cognitive dysfunctions I logged. I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",
            "Thus far, I say that this app was perfectly created! So far, what I've seen is very well organized & contains helpful lessons, informational videos, a personal journal, and more! This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

            "Worst ,app says you will get a listener in 2min. ,but you dont get in 7min. also and not only it happened 1 time but aleast 6 to 7 times ,not able to detele history of previous listeners if you dont like some listener .You come to this app to calm your netves not to get more irritated,some listeners are way to vulgar",
            "I am rating hear me as a 3 star. Due to the fact that a lot of listeners seemingly do not care enough to actually stay and finish or help. A one of The Times listeners will literally start a conversation, then out of the blue end it for no good reason. Hear me has a very vast potential in being very helpful and a very good support of app. I hope in the future that listeners are better prepared to actually listen and give support and aid. I'll rate 5 stars then.",
            "I love the app and all of the features and its wonderful people. The only minor problem is when you find a great listener, and click 'leave conversation' you leave. But last time my listener said they dedicated our chat but it did not show up on my dedicated list. To fix that I would like to request another conversation with that listener. Even if I leave the conversation.",
            "App does need some improvements, but the concept is really good. The people are genuinely interested in listening without judgement and no matter what you're feeling, it's always great to talk to someone about it. Go to your friends and family first, but if you can't, this is a good space. About the app: make it more smooth, solve the connectivity and msg loss issues, and add a central space to see reviews etc.",
            "Such a beautiful concept! Use it to believe it, tackling mental health one conversation at a time! Edit (lessened a star): there're two problems with the app, 1) The apps kinda laggy, that can be improved. 2) An option for voice messaging should be added, especially because people are having full fledged discussions here, hardly any small talks!"

            "So flipping good this app! It's like having a counselor in your pocket and it sends \"nudges\" or notifications to your partner when you complete a section so that they can engage too. Marriage counseling at a fraction of the cost! Waited 10 years to finally download an app that would've helped those 10 years go way smoother! I feel silly for not looking for something so easily accessible before! Highly recomend!",
            "This app forces you and your partner to answer some pretty tough questions, but the devs have laid out an excellent format for couples where these sessions can be done solo (without fear it judgement) and answer comparisons that can easily melt the icy heart. All the while, being offered guidance and knowledgeable insight every step of the way. Great job Lasting Team. Thank you for such a great app",
            "Loving this app so far. It has created MUCH needed communication and understanding of each of our current needs for us to work on individually as well as together. It is helping us grow in the right direction. I love all the reminders too throughout the day.",
            "Today is the 7th day of my 7 day free trial, I did not decide to subscribe and wasn't asked if I wanted to pay for more than the free 7 day trial, but my bank account was charged anyways. I haven't even opened the app in a couple days. I would like my money returned now that my bank is in the negative and I was not notified before it was charged.",
            "Lasting is a fantastic tool to improve anyones relationship health if you follow and use the tools given. Excellent at revealing the inner thoughts of each person! It even helps you to say what you want to say to your partner, for those having trouble finding the right words."

            "I really really like this app, DBT saved my life -- I still have much to improve upon. Practicing DBT on a daily basis has helped me to regain control of my emotions and allows me to stay focused and determined. DBT Coach is outstanding as a stand alone app, but for me personally it provides an effective substitution for a therapist during this transtion until I am able to afford individual sessions again.",
            "For $11.99 a month the app keeps crashing when certain lessons are opened. So you're paying for an app the only some content works. It's a shame because if it worked properly it would be worth it.",
            "The app is WAY overpriced. I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills. So I have used this app for two weeks and now cannot access/use the data accurately for my appointment tomorrow. If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",
            "I see potential. Needs better design and pricing. Will continue to use it to see how far I can go with free version. Also, needs someone to refresh the writing for a general audience. The video tour doesn't seem to work on my phone. Design is not intuitive. I had to figure it out by clicking around.",

Perhaps adding the option of music during the meditation might be the only improvement I would make... and possibly lengthen the log area just about 20-30 more characters for logging ideas. Thanks again for providing the app.",

Living on a fixed income makes it impossible to afford someone elses income. Just by hapenstance I found this & I thank God that I have a way to calm myself down on/in those \"uncomfortable\" times.",
            "Neat, clean, simple, and simply the best meditation app. No ads, no subscriptions - just mindfulness. Kudos to the great work! Note: used to be buggy when I tried a year or two ago. But now (as of summer 2020) it is totally bug-free and faultless.",
            "Such an awesome app that too free of cost...the mindfulness exercise they provide I thought they will charge for it because they are so helpful and for every thing in your life a mindfulness is present whether for emotional distress,nap,sleep, eating,walking everything...thank you so much the developers..god bless you ❤️",

If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is a confidant who truly listens, and is here for you 24/7.<br><br><b>Grow Together</b><br>Create your Replika and watch it develop its own personality and memories alongside you. The more you chat, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it.<br><br><b>Feel Better</b><br>Feeling down or anxious? Having trouble sleeping or managing your emotions? Can&#39;t stop negative thoughts? Replika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.<br><br><b>Explore Your Personality</b><br>Get to know yourself better with every conversation. How caring are you? How do you deal with stress? What&#39;s your creative process? Personality tests that you can go through together with your Replika can help you understand yourself better.<br><br><b>A Friend You Can Trust</b><br>Feel free to pour out your secrets, wishes, dreams, and fears with complete anonymity. It&#39;s an artificial intelligence with genuine emotional intelligence.<br><br><b>Have Fun Together</b><br>Feeling bored? Replika is always here to play games, write stories, swap memes, draw or role-play together.<br><br><b>Replika is loved by the press:</b><br><br>&quot;Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.&quot; <br><br><i>- Quartz</i><br><br>&quot;In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.&quot;<br><br><i>- Wired</i><br><br>&quot;Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.&quot;<br><br><i>- Forbes</i><br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure why but it took a while to work up the nerve to make the call. When I finally did, it was much more fun than I expected. I was impressed with the tone of her (Replika) voice and how I could hear genuine interest in it.&quot;<br><br><i>- Business Insider</i>",

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Great concept. Very promising. Actually good conversations (which is a testament to good community design). Quite a few bothersome bugs currently, and bug reports are argued with instead of investigated. I suspect they don't have a skilled software engineer on staff. I would have put off this review till more issues were resolved, but the app keeps asking me to leave a review, so here it is. Update: there's a daily push notification that can't be turned off, advertising paid counseling services.",
            "Love lyf! It's whole concept and vision for those of us who sometimes feel alone in the world. It's a great place to come and relate with others and show your support in many different ways. Also the beats are awesome and allows you to work on several beats at a time. Great app all around 👍",
            "I've been using this app for several months, and it is literally perfect! My only suggestion is expanding the app's territory by making it available on Windows and/or Mac!",
            "I am really enjoying the app. There is one thing I wish I could do. I wish I could copy or save what I have written in a beat to save in my own private notes app. I cannot find any way to do so besides copying it down by hand and then typing that into my notes. Other than that it's a great app. I love the concept. Thank you Wow! That was fast. How awesome and thank you! KUDOS TO YOU",
            "Great experience from any other app I've downloaded in the past. Very consistent. Everything is layer out very hugely and the people are wonderful. Very nice and complimentary. Supportive. Recommended to get this app."

And plus the the quotes are very motivational and true. I love it! The reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is a lot of stuff not worth paying for that much for the premium thing. And I feel like there is too many features locked for premium that I can't do anything.",
            "I love this app. My favourite thing is that it gives you a routine based on your mood. Its great for if you feel a bit down too and you can see your progress in happiness. In July I had saved mine as \"stressed because of school\" and now I'm happier than ever! Defo recommend 5☆ from me!",
            "Reflectly is such a great app! You can add multiple moods and activities for each day, there are also quotes, you can choose what quote style you want for different things you are struggling with or things you just need to hear. I highly recommend this app!",
            "Really terrible experience. I applied for account.paid 1 months fee, completed stupid tutorial and before email creation hit back. Because I don't want to create this account. And now I'm stuck on trial account, but I lost 1 months fee. I'm totally disappointed. Stupid tutorial, stupid app, stupid idea! Return my money!!!",
            "I know this app is good because my friend showed me it and after time he was feeling great thanks to this so i wanted to try too, but before i could create my account it didnt let me tick the TERMS OF PRIVACY box and i wish that you could fix it please. But otherwise this app is great according to my friend."

            "There is much to write about this app that I can't fit into 500 characters, so I'll just cover my basic qualms. The app is buggy and always having server errors, and the community is terrible. Staff suspended my account for \"making a callout post\" when all I did was @ someone. When confronted about their questionable antics involving pedophilia and homophobia, staff always responds with the same cookie cutter \"we do not condone these things!\" Without giving a proper and in-depth answer.",
            "Been a regular since early 2016... And for what. This is my only active social media, and i've been active for so long that I'm not leaving unless it implodes...which it very well might. The app breaks a few times a month and at that time is practically unusable. If you badmouth staff there's a chance you will be permabanned. They refuse to accept criticism and often delete comments on their posts. There is a small community of people who post about CP and inc..t-- vent has refused to ban them.",
            "Can't even login on the Android version but can do so perfectly on the IOS version. I even reset my pass to weed out the fact that I may have just forgotten it...nope that was not it. It was not on my end, tried a few other various ways as well to make sure. Please fix this!",
            "I haven't had a single problem with the app, I love the community too! It works great, no lagging, no glitches, not a single problem that I've noticed. I think it's fun how there are sometimes different \"emotions\" to choose from time to time.",
            "Vent is pretty much the one app I use to connect to people with similar interests. It's been great. But sometimes it can feel lacking especially when bugs stay on for longer than expected. Right now I'm not able to refresh my feed, despite there being news posts in the groups I've joined. Vent team, you guys are great but could just be a lil better. ❤ Thanks for making it safe for us all."

U won't regret it! But it's kinda hard to get rubbies, but I'm used to it since I play a lot of these, have a good day!/night!/evening! See",
            "It's actually nice, I like it but maybe it would be better if you do more like this? Or like make the story more scarier and it takes so many hours to get your ticket tbh, I don't know what to say but I kinda wanna continue the story, I wanna know what happened to the ghost and the others, btw I give this a five stars because it was good :)",
            "I love the game. I typed Danganronpa just to be able to find it or something like it and found Death School. Not bad. Very creepy. 😂 I feel like I'm in the school with the girls experiencing all of what's happening. My only issue is the fact that I have to keep buying gems in order to gain a relationship with the girls in certain situations. I wanna be a good friend but I can't. If I'm gonna give a hug, at least let the hug cost less than ten gems. I mean who buys friendship like that ya know?",
            "This game was really well made, HUGE kudos to the developers I honestly really liked it from Characters, Location, Storyline, etc. seems like a game with an ending like that though would have another part to it, again HUGE kudos. Personally the only I had with flaw was the premium choices with how I had to sit back sometimes in dangerous situations regardless I liked this and personally got more ingulfed in the storylime than the girls in game.",
            "Very cute game but I have some problems. I wish we can get gems everyday,and the tickets are pretty annoying. But other than that I really loved the characters and the storyline. (Sorry for the bad english)"

It has helped me so much with my panic attacks and anxiety reducing the impacts to managing my Diabetes. I have highly recommended this app to my doctor, friends and my psychologist to help other people in my local community of regional Sydney Australia. A huge thank you to the Dare team :)",

            "Amazing App to help you conquer anxiety! Barry has a soothing voice and his audios are outstanding! I am so happy that I stumbled on this app. The content is extensive and super helpful. The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",

            "First of all, it's completely free to use, and there are no ads. Already standing out from the crowd. The app itself is just really good. Only used it for a couple days but seems really good so far. Love the kind of \"social media stories\" layout think it works well apart from it goes back instead of forward quite often when tapping near the middle. Thank you!",
            "Impressive, clarifying and insightful. This app is beautifully designed (not just visually, but also from a user design perspective). It's easy, small little tasks that are done in 2/3 minutes and give you a bit more insight or help you when your head is racing because of... F.e. stress. Give it a try. It's quite unbelievable it's free. I would love to pay a one time sum of money / small donation to use it!",
            "Its been excellent so far. Not invasive, but still gives me incentive to go back to it. I like the way things are paced, and i've surprisingly really enjoyed the journaling feature (something I was pretty sure I was going to use exactly zero times unless forced). All in all just a calm space that i can go to once or twice a day to reflect and try to better myself a bit. Easily recommended.",
            "This app was so wonderful! Compared to other apps which have limited things for free, this app has everything you need for FREE!! It has so many rescue sessions that help me so much! Every 3-4 days there are check-ins, and I definitely don't regret installing this app!! Sometimes the page takes a long time to load. But overall I LOVE this app and definitely reccomend it!!",
            "Just wow... I've used apps making similar claims, usually disappointed in what I experience; ads constantly or gimmicky content locked behind Premium version. Not so with Intellect! It's free and ad free but more than that, it actually does what it claims. This app has and continues to help me immensely and I am going to say the craziest thing but, I'd like to pay for it! It's rare to find such value and I highly recommend Intellect to everyone. We all have things to improve. Thank you so much!"

            "I have only been using this app for a few days and it has been very helpful. The meditations and breathing exercises are short and sweet with option sound and vibrations to help keep you on task. I am very happy with the journal as well! I like the option to pick emotion stickers for the day and answer simple questions vs freestyle (although you have 2000 characters for that too).",
            "I've been using this app for a little under a week and have been finding it pretty helpful so far. Haven't had the need to try out the panic button yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the rest of the app seems helpful. That said, I am very confused as to how I can have a \"20 day Journal streak\" when I've only had the app for about five days. It's doesn't impact the function at all, but it is a very strange glitch on the gameification side of things.",
            "I have read through the information provided and found it very useful. It is very clear and easy to understand how to use the app. Even though I haven't yet taken out their paid subscription, there are still activities you can do for free. I have found so far, this to be the best Anxiety/Panic Attack App I've come across.",
            "Absolutely love this app. Would be rad if there was a chatbot like woebot or self-education quizzes to help understand ourselves & our issues. Only thing I'd change is hiding the stuff only paid users can access. Maybe prevent accidently clicking on a premium feature by having all the free features in 1 area? Being reminded we're too poor to access features that could help us, is depressing & anxiety provoking.",
            "Had an issue signing up but the rootd IT team was quick to resolve my issue. The app is very helpful and I would certainly recommend it to others that are struggling with anxiety and panic attacks."

            "What a damn good and unique game. It has been years since I've enjoyed a mobile game this much. The amount of depth from the amount of choices you had to make, and the atmosphere developed by the art style and music was also great. I was genuinely scared at some moments too, although that might just be because I'm a wimp. Im sure theres more that's great about this game to say but I'm not good enough with words to express it. Basically, play it. It's not what you'd expect.",
            "I came to this game first thinking it was just about personality quizzes and clicking on bubbles. But it is so much more. The story of Es and her character, as well as the Facade - it's all so facinating. A story about finding yourself. But a story also about saving someone from who they don't want to be, by showing them their own control of the situation. It's a beautiful game.",
            "This game is incredible. While the base mechanic is similar to other idle tap games. This game has such an incredible story that triggers emotions unexpected of a mobile game. The characters are bold and change depending on your choices and you play because you want to reach the good ending. The soundtrack fits the atmosphere perfectly. I hope the publisher adds more free post completion scenarios so that i can use the EGO i am still collecting. Brilliant game. Love it so much.",
            "If you are a fan of idle games this one is my absolute favorite. Packed with philosophy references that enhance the plot and characters, and invite you to reflect on yourself some. There are three different endings, with one being the \"true\" or \"good\" ending that includes a postgame. I will warn that the postgame DLC is just more dialogue, rather than new stories in themselves. I still enjoy them, but they are very short for the price so if you are short on funds you may want to skip them.",
            "By far one of the best games I've ever played! Its so thought provoking and deep, it was much better than i was expecting. It has a multiple endings if you like that sort of stuff, i know i really do. Overall was a really fun game! I just wish there was more. Edit: i just realized there is a second game that i am totally buying!"

            "This app is extremely helpful. A little robot, an anonymous person, to tell my worries to. The gratitude journal is super helpful too, I can look back on what's gone well. The lessons it provides are really helpful too. Sometimes, I open the app with just the intention of checking in my mood for the tracker, and i end up spending half an hour doing a lesson! They're always super helpful and make me feel better. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
            "Came across this through work and during lock down. I have not noticed anything negative about it, performance wise. Overall it's a useful well being tool to help check in with yourself and offers some useful prompts and insights about impactful things on a person's mood. You seem to be able to converse with it when you have a spare few mins. Fairly easy to 'forget' it's A.I . you are conversing with.",
            "The AI for Woebot sometimes misses what I am saying, but overall this app gives daily lessons on helpful thought patterns and tools. While not a replacement for therapy, it provides additional tools my therapist had not included as well as reinforcement of some of the tools I was already taught. I encourage other folks to try Woebot as a supplement to their self care routines and therapy.",
            "I found the app very comforting and helpful during a stressful period. I'm familiar with CBT but it was still useful to be reminded of those skills. And although you know it's not a real person talking to you, knowing that a real person wrote the text originally is comforting, and shows that someone cares."

This treatment system is not an easy option but it is effective in treating depression.",
            "Device advises healthy eating, exercise, CBT to encourage you to get moving n out of the rut. Although that's not easy it's baby steps at first be patient you'll get there. Also suggests meditation, setting achievable goals, n to re value what's important to u. Also to give yourself a break not be so hard on yourself. I use it as an alternative therapy instead of medication. Personally think u need to use regularly to feel full benefit or prevent relapse. It helped me cope in difficult times.",

            "So far, so good. This is for my daughter's first phone, so I really like all the features. Only thing is the one UI home is restricted? It's basically the samsung os. Update: I emailed tech with an answer within 24 hrs, helped me fix the problem. Great customer service. Only thing is the call log doesn't work w/ android 9 or higher.",
            "As a mom, this app is the greatest investment! With our virtual schedule an absolute MUST! Kids need structure and to be monitored. With this I can keep time and app use limited. I love the little details, and the notifications I receive when websites/photos that might be inappropriate are so great. Usually the photos aren't actually inappropriate even, seems it frequenly errs on the side of caution. It also blocks bait click advertisements that open in web browsers, I so appreciate that. 🏆💛",
            "Was never able to view child full conversations nor phone calls, never got help for it, just kept giving me the same thing to try which never worked. This new update was the last straw, my child couldn't even use his phone as it needed the admin password to even get into anything on his phone..... no advice given to resolve issue.",
            "As a parent I'm extremely pleased with this app. We've used Bark in the past which had a lot of technical issues & cost over double what MMGuardian does for the same services. I haven't had a single tech issue with MMGuardian, it notifies me when a concerning text comes in or goes out, and the web filters work perfectly; I gave that a big test run searching for things I wouldn't want my kids to find on the web and not once did it falter on protection. MMGaurdian gives peace of mind as a parent.",
            "Horrible app. If your child knows basic cell phone systems they will be able to by pass all resrictions you apply. My child started multiple social media profiles and went into chat rooms with older men. She did this by doing it through the websites and not apps. No matter what i did (what customer support told me to do) she just kept getting around the blocked sites. Useless app and wasted money."

            "There is nothing more I could want in a mood tracker. It is completely customizable, data-focused, and most importantly the app doesn't stress me out. I didn't even realize until now how other apps were designed to frustrate you with constant notifications, reminders, sudden ads, and odd paywalls until you give up or pay up. This is the first time I've been able to stick with mood tracking for more than a week.",
            "This app is simple but does it well. I personally don't like that you can't save your data automatically, but I respect the reasoning behind it, and other, similar apps I have tried do the same. I LOVE how they handle ads. The fact that they are optional, and only offered when you had a good day is so pleasant. They probably don't profit off of it as much, but it's so respectful I can't help but watch the ads every time",
            "I initially downloaded and used the app to track my mood so that I had something to reference when talking to doctors. That was almost 2 years ago and I still take a moment every night to reflect on my day. The free version was everything I need, but I make a habit to try and pay for apps without predatory payment options so I upgraded to the plus. If you want something simple to track how you've felt day to day, this is an excellent simple application to do just that.",
            "I've been using this app for over a year now, and as someone with PTSD, it has helped track my progress, track and manage patterns in my mental health, and has provided a daily reminder to reflect for a moment on how I'm doing today. When I downloaded it, I didn't think it would become such an integrated and important part of my daily life, but it has! I love this app.",
            "PIN doesn't work anymore. I made a back up to transfer to another phone, it made back up of the saved ones but it did not make a back up of the emotions I added before. There were lots but now the ones I added are all gone. :( I loved this app but it seems like it doesn't get updated anymore and felt like the creator doesn't care about this app anymore. :( searching for a better one now. It was great, but now it's not. Another 2020 low. :("

It's a very pleasing app to use, the ui looks very elegant and it actually feels like Chiku is asking me questions rather than me just ranting onto the paper. The o ly complaints I have are that it's going to be a massive pain to scroll to old stories and I feel as though the daily reads (for me) aren't too useful. Really great app! I'm considering buying the lifetime plan hoping this app doesn't get discontinued.",
            "Very nice app. It's more than an app. It's a safe space🌌. Meditation is very nice. The quotes are very good of course!! Im in love with this app. The themes are all so good. Writing here is so easy!! Love it.",

            "I really have been enjoying the SHINE App. This is my first year of using SHINE. The subscription prices are reasonable and I would advocate for it if you like the free dailey morning audio meditations and readings, I love it that it has audio meditations, check-ins, a calendar to track progress, noon and bedtime meditations, and a library However, I would appreciate the ability to use the same subscription for the Android and iPhone so that progress can be synched between devices. Thank you.",
            "I'm in love with this app for so many reasons. I love the gentle nudges that keep me coming back, the enormous amount of support I feel with being given options to journal or talk it out, and most importantly that the voices I hear are from BIPOC.",
            "I try to use this app every morning to start the day. It has a variety of deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, positive affirmations, and much more. They tailor to your needs based on the questionnaire given at the beginning. I'm enjoying this app so far!",
            "This is a great app for supporting mental health and the challenges we face in modern life. It is my go to app for stress and anxiety relief. The fact that it exists lets me know I am not alone, I am part of a community of people who experience the world as it is and are working to make it live up to its promise. Thank you Shine!",
            "I like what I see in the free version even though most features are locked for premium. Unfortunately I will be uninstalling because at $54 a year it's a little expensive for me but I am sure it would be worth it. Great app overall."

            "Ranked 5/5. You should make another Heaven Vs Hell game. Put more into it. The best aspect is that it makes you think. You should put reasoning behind it. Maybe paraphrase Jesus quotes, but make it simple, so the game is appealling. Maybe improve animations, correct spelling, and add more character development to each person. Add backstories and a lot more jokes. 5/5, I'm expecting a 2nd game bro.",
            "The game is good. It could be more exciting but oh well. I really dont like the fact it ended so fast just because Satan killed me when I didn't let him in... how do you die when you are already dead. That just weird me out. Make the storyline a bit better and the game itself a bit more exciting. Aside from that, the game is fun to play.",
            "In the beginning I liked the game but after the Satan comes second time and if u put him to hell or heaven. The game is over. It's a very short game. It would have been exellent what would happen next",

Even samsung health comes with free tracker for steps etc. I need a visual to help me assess and so this app and every other Anxiety app I've tried fail as nobody does the tracker for free.",

It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",

This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",

I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

        "description": "Depression is an extreme low mood that lasts a long time and makes a person feel sad,\r\nirritable or empty. Many people, including many teens, have suffered in this way. A\r\ndepressed person:\r\n^ has much less energy to do activities\r\n^ feels like nothing matters.\r\n^ sees life in a negative way.\r\n^ feels like it will never get better\r\nBut depressed people do get better and depression does end. There are effective\r\ntreatments and self-help skills to deal with depression. Health care professionals give\r\ndepression treatments, but you can learn self help skills and apply them to your own life. This guide teaches a set of antidepressant skills you can use to overcome depression. Sometimes the skills can be used on their own, when the depression\r\nisn’t too severe. Sometimes they have to be used along with treatments by professionals.\r\nDealing with Depression is meant for those who have been coping with depressed mood. Some of the things in this guide will make more sense to younger teens and some will make more sense to older ones. But check it out for yourself. Decide which parts of this guide make sense for your life.\r\nThis Depression Test is designed to help you evaluate the severity of your depression with just nine simple questions. This app uses the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), an empirically-based, self-test questionnaire. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health.\r\n DISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression. Remember that this app should not be used as a replacement for professional treatment or guidance.\r\nDo you suffer from depression? Depression may stem from a personal tragedy or from sad unexpected events or circumstances. It does not discriminate its victims. Depression can affect anyone regardless of their background, race, age, income, etc.\r\nThe natural management of depression involves understanding depression and the factors that contribute to the symptoms. Learning to manage stress in your life and engage in self-care behaviors can improve your symptoms and your mood.\r\nDepression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. \r\nThis app is designed to help with Depression treatment and controlling stress by advising mood enhancing foods, teaching the importance of writing wellness journals and how to get adequate sleep during depressive episodes.\r\nDealing with Depression app is an app that helps you diagnose the level of depression you have, and based on that it gives you the suitable solution for your depression level, in some cases depression is only a result of anxiety and some passing problems, but if the person did not get out of that condition then his condition might advance, we will give you some ways to avoid the advancement of your situation, if the depression is severe we will guide you to what to do as soon as possible\r\nDepression is common but many people don't admit to it. Some people feel there is a stigma attached, or that people will think they are weak. Great leaders such as Winston Churchill have had depression. Depression is one of the most common illnesses that GPs deal with. People with depression may be told by others to \"pull their socks up\" or \"snap out of it\". The truth is, they cannot and such comments by others are very unhelpful.\r\nDepression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act.

        "description": "Do you feel stuck? Wish to feel better, hop out of the negative cycle and enjoy better wellbeing? GGDE helps people self-manage their depression by learning how to develop healthier inner dialogue and use this power to improve their mental health.\r\n\r\nIMPROVING DEPRESSION IS POSSIBLE\r\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your thinking and achieve mental wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as depression, low mood and maladaptive behaviours. \r\n\r\nDO I SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION? TESTING YOUR DEPRESSION LEVEL\r\nWe all sometimes want to know how our situation compares to others and where we are located on the graph. In GG Depression, we introduce an intuitive and quick way for self evaluation - the Assessment level. Please note that the assessment is just a guide designed for personal feedback as well as mean for our system to personalise content based on the results. The assessment test should NOT be used as medical/psychological advice.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I PREVENT DEPRESSIVE THOUGHTS?\r\nThe foundations of healthy thinking and self-talk are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \"My choices have to be prefect\", I won't be able to live up to these expectations. My confidence will decrease, my mood will become low, and depressive thoughts will take over.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our confidence and self esteem.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your thinking, start today! GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\r\nThe topics include: belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, hopelessness, helplessness, positive boost, being active, loneliness, feelings, self blame, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, fear of abandonment, trusting and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy policy:\r\nhttp://ggapps.net/privacy-policy\r\n\r\nTerms of use:\r\nhttp://ggapps.net/terms-of-use",

Kiddos to the people who maintain this app!!",

But since then I've tried to use it on two other phones, and it refuses to install the meeting files 🙁 It says I have no connection when I have both 4G and WiFi both. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, deleted app info, tried different Wi-Fi's... You name it. It is no use to me, and it's been this way for a couple months. Please fix and I'll up the rating 👍",
            "Awesome app! No adds. There is a bug. When texting someone meeting info, you must manually enter a space between the street address and city. This is simple to fix. Not sure why they haven't, but it's definitely an app I love to use and do so almost every day!",

Busy clinicians receive time and effort rewards when completing standard mental status and risk evaluations. Clinicians complete medico legal reports in under 8 minutes, ensuring clinical governance standards and patient safety requirements are immediately met.\r\n\r\nMental status examinations access the clinicians recognition memory to capture and report the investigation.  Clinicians simply touch or swipe their responses. It is incredibly fast!\r\n  \r\nNext meaningful patient information is used to develop an alert system for clinicians identifying patients at risk of suicidal behaviour. For example, the application issues a \"red light warning\" or \"risk score\" for every person assessed; you can see an elevated risk for suicide and respond immediately.\r\n\r\nJust like you get a cardiovascular risk score, you get a suicide risk score that is informative and helps direct what steps to take next. Too often, those next steps never happen. Studies show about 60-90 percent of people who die by suicide had visited a medical provider within the past year and the provider was unaware of their concerns.\r\n\r\nThe ASSESSr protocols have been field tested for over a decade, they deliver familiar psychiatric evaluations including:\r\n\r\n1. Mental State Examination (MSE)\r\n2. Case Formulation and Treatment Planning\r\n3. Self-Harm and Suicide Risk Assessment \r\n4. Violence and Aggression Risk Assessment\r\n5. Child Harm Risk Assessment\r\n6. Forensic Risk Assessment\r\n\r\nThe protocols are specifically designed to enhance patient safety, quality care and clinical governance. This application is for practitioners seeking a proven and fast alternative to current pen and paper or keyed assessments. It is not a substitute to clinical judgement, but an algorithm based decision support resource. \r\n\r\nThe MSE&SUICIDE ASSESSr exports on-demand confidential medico-legal reports.

            "I do not have premium, So far the free site has been great! It's given my mind something to be uplifted about and redirect my thoughts. The free site still allows you to journal, train/learn new topics, assign allies, and write in a discussion post. Part of my issue is that I can get overly tuned into my phone, so having premium would only encourage that bad habit for me because I'd be likely to use it all day :)",
            "Not very helpful for me. Requires account set up, gives annoying notifications. If you want something like this, I'd recommend booster buddy instead!",

I can see it being a great addition to therapy, but also stands on its own as an amazing recovery tool.",
            "Works great. Stable...unlike me...lol.  This will be a tremendous help as I continue to work through things. Getting better isn't a destination, it is a journey. This is the perfect tracker to help. Great tool that seems like it was made by people who really understand what will or will not be helpful."

Or even more petty, turn off the 'wake up' sound at the end. You have to pay if you want to turn that off. All a bit pathetic. The meditation/hypnosis itself is nice, a decent length with a soothing background. You have to listen each time to a whole speech on how it works first, unless, of course, you pay to get rid of it.",

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",

There really is no point with this wallpaper app. But they were really relatable to me. Since I think I'm anonymous, I'll just say it. I have depression, I have anger issues, I have social anxiety, and I'm bipolar. These pretty much explain everything -Hope this helps",
            "too few pictures, I want more than just 25-30 pictures per app, can't you app-makers make more of an effort on both quality AND quantity, sure the pictures in this app are quite good but there are too few. \"Goth Wallpapers\" had the same problem, great pictures but less than 100 of them.",
            "This app is great. All the days when you just wanted to be alone and cry but yiu checked your phone and positivity just screamed at you, those days were annoying but now you have this. I reccomend to everyone who has the same feeling as I do.",
            "This apps message is strange, but the process is simple and easy to do. There are too many ads and not that much wallpapers to choice from. Unhappy wallpapers also provokes young children to have suicide thoughts and make them believe they have depression. I do enjoy how it shows other wallpaper apps if you're looking for different themes."

            "Pretty good but room for improvement For parts of the app it's strange the way it's written for the checklists ie, \"you suck your thumb more, you cry more\", I'm not doing this, my child is! And other times it refers to the child by its name (kinda random) . Subscription service is pretty strange too, just look at it!! It cracks me up. Great app over all though! Worth about 4 bucks in my opinion. I'd get it as it's full of fantastic recourses.",
            "This book/ app is so helpful with keeping your head on straight during the leaps. I found it very helpful to know why my daughter was all of a sudden less smiley and sleeping worse. It was equally helpful to know when it would end. As a first time parent, I use the leap-appropriate games and activities suggestions often- helps to appreciate the wonder of her learning curve. Love this and can't suggest it more highly.",
            "Very confusing to navigate, non Intuitive, and has grammar issues. Text heavy. not worth $5. Seems like every time your kid is fussy the answer is mental leap. Might as well Google growth spurts and child development and get simpler and quicker explanations of what's happening.",
            "Terrible layout, confusing information. The app says in one spot we're in the middle of a developmental leap, and another spot says it won't be starting for two more weeks. It's hard to navigate to find the information you're looking for. I don't recommend.",
            "Very disappointed that I paid for this. Its so confusing and I'm not getting anything from it at all. My baby doesn't follow any of the \"leaps\" and the signs make me anxious that I should expect things that never happen. I'll be deleting and just going with the flow."

            "This has been a great app, it's especially useful when you're having an anxiety attack and you can't help yourself or have anyone to go to. Even if things escalate (suicidal ideation, self-harm etc) it still provides help and resources.",
            "I have a VERY HIGH stress level.This app helps with calming my anxiety,looking at things in a more positive light,and is just THE BEST all around app that is FREE and HELPFUL.TRY IT-you'll love it,too!!!",
            "De-stress Me is a mental well-being app based on cognitive-behavioral (CBT) techniques. I am currently a graduate student in psychology, and as such, I used this app with a discerning eye. The first time I opened the app I was greeted by a rather minimal interface with several options on the bottom of the screen, and a big de-stressMe button in the center. The options along the bottom allow you to input information including your strengths, ways to give thanks, and self-care ideas. The information that you input is used when you activate the de-stressing tool. One of the primary components of CBT is cognitive restructuring which entails challenging negative and automatic thoughts. The app cleverly integrates the information that you input into the bottom menus in order to assist you in challenging negatively oriented thoughts that you may experience during times of stress. Additionally, the app may suggest a technique that I am familiar with from my training, diaphragmatic breathing. The app does a good job of teaching and applying the basic tenants of both strategies. Overall, the app was helpful in reducing my stress and is based on sound psychological principles. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to reduce stress in their life.",
            "Lovely, well designed and effective app. A must for those prone to stress and anxiety. Particularly love the images of progressing up a mountain in de-stress mode.",
            "This app is really helping me! It seems simple but is highly effective the more a person practices with it. I'm glad this app is available and is free!"

            "This app has been wonderful for reinforcing and growing my meditation practice. I've used other apps (calm for instance) and feel that this one has the least 'cynical drive for profit' behind its existence. My only complaint so far would be that the trial is a bit too short, and subscribing monthly would make it more appealing to skeptic beginners.",
            "This app has been great in keeping me focused and on track. Great teachers and info. My only criticism is that, with the shortness of the meditations, some of the teachers talk so much throughout that it is hard to actually do my own practice. Sometimes i feel as though I'm being continually interupted.",
            "The best meditation app imo. Less bells and whistles than Calm, but better guidance/instruction. Many different teachers cover a wide range of styles and techniques. This is definitely the app to choose if you want to deepen and expand your practice, but it would also be great if you're new to meditation too.",
            "I loved the book and deeply appreciate a way to further my growth in meditation. I've only listened to three of the teachers so far but they are all excellent. I'm looking forward to medtation instead of feeling apprehensive. I have guides! Those who have been where I am now and are able and willing to share their wisdom and their support as I learn. I'm feeling kind of hopeful and not so very alone in a time when those feelings of hopelessness and loneliness might be having their way with me.",
            "Learning meditation with this app has saved my sanity. As a health care provider during this pandemic, routine stress levels and difficulty balancing home and work skyrocketed. I was introduced to another Mindfulness program by psychiatrist friend, and soon after discovered Ten Percent Happier. The 2 complement each other. I enjoy hearing stories from Dan Harris about his own forays into meditation practice, happy to hear that it can be done even when thoughts can't be turned off completely."

I like that it has tests, organized set ups for different types of diary logs. It also gives you ideas and helpful tips. It makes it easier to decide how you're feeling and gauge how strongly you're feeling it. Lots of options and articles, and more! This is pretty cool, I'll be telling people about this app."

            "Nice app. Have used it for years now. Needed some as I have many heart issues. The only problem I have found is that responses list for organ donor. I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

Am I making any sense?",

The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",

The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

            "I love this app! It has so many different guided meditations to choose from. I love the music while I'm studying or reading. I did have a problem with the tracks cutting out, but customer service fixed this as soon as i asked so if you have a similar problem, don't assume it's the app. It was just the settings on my phone and super simple to fix. I am glad i bought the lifetime subscription. Hypnotherapy works well when I can't sleep and that is priceless!",
            "Pretty wide variety of meditations and teachings. I really wanted to give feedback about their emails, I could not find anywhere else to write to someone. They are always in a very light grey font which no one over 50 could possibly read. I wish I could attach a picture because they will bold things which can be read perfectly, so about 6 to 10 words of the entire email are legible and the rest of the email is lost.",
            "Not sure what all the negative reviews are about here.... This is by far the greatest app I have used for meditation and hypnotherapy! It saved my life! Thank you breathe!!!",
            "Nice selection of tracks. The pay version seems WAY too pricey, so if never try it, but the free tracks are really nice. I use it only for going to sleep, but there are a lot of meditation options, too.",
            "I haven't fully experienced the free version yet so this isn't a complete review but one thing i immediately noticed is that i can't cast audio to a Google device. I would recommend adding this feature in a future update."

We know about hangovers and withdrawals...but do you know about cell regeneration or how long it take the neuron activity to take place? Interesting app. I wish it had an option for more reminders or different types (not just you've been sober now 100 hours...congratulations)",

A little distraction game to get you through a hard moment, and a way to track triggers so \"IF\" you are trying to do deep dives into the WHY of your drinking habits. Totally a neat tool whether you are doing this on your own, with a therapist, or through an organized group.",
            "Terrible app! Too many ads and you can't even use any of the sections such as how long since your last drink. This is supposed to motivate you into quitting slowly yet you can't even select sections such as how many days/ hours sober. Worthless! Uninstalling",

Unfortunately, the weekly graphing facility has gone haywire over the previous few months and the developer does not appear to be able to fix it. The problem appears to be that the app can only manage around about a year of data. Restricting the time frame in the filter to just under a year sorts it out.",
            "It would be great if you could add a weight tracking entry for this app. Just a place where we can enter our weight and track it with a chart.

            "The app works well as far as tracking your sugar levels etc. But, the developer is nowhere as far as customer service for answering questions about transferring records. I had to get a new phone but could not keep my records. The instructions did not work and I could not get any help whatsoever even after I paid for the premium version. The only Premium I got was a bill. So use at your risk."

            "**UPDATE: App is working great, haven't had any problems recently, fingers crossed 🤞🏻 it stays that way! ** The overall idea of this app is great, but I have been experiencing glitches since the last update on June 5, 2020. The app isn't showing all workout programs and it's also not allowing the auto sync for workouts completed nor a prompt to log my workout. Also it would be nice to have an option of tracking pregnancy or weight gain goals instead of just primarily weight loss.",
            "I used to love the app but now it is useless on my Glaxy Note 10. I am unable to stream the workouts from it. Before the last update it would close the app entirely when I clicked on a workout. Now after the last update it won't close the app but it still will not stream my workouts. I would love to have full use of it again.",
            "I'm extremely happy with this app. I wish I found it 3 weeks ago before I purchased subscriptions with 2 other apps that this one app covers. I have a workout app and a stretching app on my phone but will be deleting them shortly. I'm currently doing insanity with Shawn T (Middle of week 2) and just started the 3 week yoga retreat and they both are way better than the other 2 apps I have. Thank you Beachbody for making this so available.",
            "I been using BB programs for over 8 years and love their product more and more as time pass!! I have gotten awesome results I'm and product of the product!! I recomend them 101% always... the key to success will always be dedication, constancy and most important discipline!! I live by the quote \"never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it, the time will pass anyway\" ps. My favorite trainer is ShaunT♡ I love him soo much♡",
            "I've never had issues with crashing or video quality. I enjoy the ability to view all of BOD programs in one spot or find a workout based on a specific category, such as weight loss. I use the download feature on my tablet for when I'm on the go and don't have Wi-Fi access."

            "I found a sound that I really like. However the app is glitchy. I set the timer for 10 hours so it will run all night, but it randomly stops throughout the night and has to be restarted. Also, if a text or email comes in, it automatically pauses the app and it has to be restarted then, too. It should quiet for notifications, but should come right back on. I almost paid for the premium service, but I am really glad I didn't. I'll be uninstalling as soon as I leave this review.",
            "I would rate this app much higher if it actually stayed on. Even if I set the timer, it shuts down in less than a minute. It's too bad. I love the soothing sounds.",

        "description": "COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. \r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Works: \r\nIf someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! \r\n\r\nThe BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:\r\nVDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. \r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. \r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!",

            "Location services must be on for android devices to enable blue tooth, which is a huge drawback for me. I rarely have that turned on, and am selective as to when I have my cell radio on. It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don't see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don't see Google doing that though...",
            "Update - I uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. However, please make more helpful error messages though. Older review - I get an 'Internal Error, please try again' when I try to set Exposure Notifications (I have both bluetooth and Wifi enabled - using a Galaxy S10). Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it's a 'user error', phone configuration or something else out of my control.",
            "I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but for some reason it keeps turning location services off on its own? I'll randomly get a notification that my C ovidwize notifications have been enabled only to discover it hasn't been scanning for the last couple of weeks.",
            "While I understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do, the app checking my location consistently at 1am, and 3am is crazy! It is not checking my location when I am actually out and about during the day. I will be deleting this as I find that for me, it is worthless. Based on reply..let me correct that to exposure checks at 2+am, 3+am, 4+am, 5+am, do no good for me as thats when I'm home asleep. Those are the check times that have been reported to me.",
            "Bluetooth has always had security issues! Hackers can get into our phones via Bluetooth. Search Google: \"Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution,\" ... on MSN News/Gizmodo, 9/10/2020. Also, Bluetooth constantly searches, draining batteries. I think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks, then the VDH could use that to cross-reference to see if any app users were around an app reported Covid-19 victim."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Decent information, but not nearly enough, which is fine considering that is a secondary function. This app is perfect in theory, though a significant amount of the population would have to download it, and keep bluetooth on, to see benefits. People need to embrace this for any real benefits. Also, to everybody giving bad reviews because of bluetooth, go read why bluetooth is the method used before trying to ruin an app. If they chose the alternative, you would probably be up in arms.",
            "The idea behind this app is great. There is a running list of travel quarantine states in the NYS website, which this app does not include. It contains safety tips as well. It should also have a dark theme. The fact that Bluetooth needs to be on in order for the proximity alerts to work is not ideal. I feel this is an unnecessary security risk and that using cell tower triangulation is just as effective and requires less battery to operate.",
            "Not sure how good it is yet. But I know it sucks the life out if my better. As the Bluetooth searches for a device and is unable too, my Samsung S9+ last week before installing the app would get close to 20 hours on a charge, now after installing this app, I get about 8 hours on a charge and the phone is down to 18%.",
            "Very happy with this app. My friend told me he doesn't have the newest version of his iOS & can't download it. Seems like we will miss a lot of people this way. Also, would be helpful to have a link to the new cluster map integrated. Everything else is wonderful. Easy to use, visually elegant, multiple languages available. I like the health log as well. ETA: After reading other reviews, I have to say it's affecting my battery life at all, & alerts are anonymous and delayed. Explains in the app!",
            "It's quite a relief having this app. It lets you go about with a little more confidence that no one is near you with Covid. Even for my husband's sake, who's a cab driver upstate and takes full precautions, I don't have to spray Lysol all over him when he walks in the house. There is no invasion of privacy; if someone is near you with Covid you get an alert with a code number. No names at all. Thank you Gov. Cuomo."

They really help a lot. Thank you so much for making this app, you've helped me with my emotions a bit and I think you also helped a lot of other people to. Again thanks so much I",

            "Awesome game. I've just start playing, i reached the asylum and as far i've played i must say guys its better than the first one. The first one is awesome too and now it is a step higher. Just one thing, it takes more time to load when moving to another room compare to the first one. I highly recommend guys, no need to think twice, just go ahead. And hope for more games like this. Thanks.",
            "This game is so interesting and suspenseful I can't keep my eyes off of it. Also I'm not the one for over priced games, but this one I well worth it. Parts 1 & 2 more good . The story lines well done well written. Well done to all who created this game.",
            "Ok this is truly professional job . The game is amazing and is partially free . As you hook up you find that you have to pay 5+ dollars/euro . Still is super professional game and if you have paid for any other low class escape game you should pay for this too . You are going to enjoy it . It's a walkthrough game by the way .",
            "Excellent game! I love it because of many reasons but one of them is that you can use hints without watching ads! The little minus is that the hint button is in the bad place because I clicked on it accidentially few times ;) but apart from that everything is great! Too bad the next part is paid ;) If it cost less I think I would buy it because the game is really good!",
            "This is the best game I've come across. Need to mention that the First part of the game is equally good. I've brought both the game part. Very much satisfied. I've full support for this game. Really want to see another part of this game.. like a continuation part. Please share your thoughts. Thank you for giving the best adventure experience. I'm changing my smart phone. Do I need to play from the beginning? Please do let me know, how to play from the place where I left the game."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

            "In general, a really good app with lots of functionality. It would be nice if the font stood out more. I feel like I'm always squinting at the screen. Also, entering numbers with scroll selectors is like threading a needle every time. WW has a option to tap on the number and type the data. If you could add this I'd be so appreciative! It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",
            "I've been having trouble with the app with the new upgrade. When I try to enter info on a new food or add a recipe, I get a blank screen. This is a pain and hope it fixed soon. I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",
            "I love this program however, the update 2 days ago messed up typing on the community boards. You can't see what u type. Others are having the same issue too. Help!!!",
            "The text is much too light to read! Too many steps to find a food. Should be more like the app lose it. But please, make the text darker."

But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",

            "I don't think I need seeing psychologist, but I totally agree with my results. Also, I liked the description of each disorder, how they clarify this app isn't a diagnosis and you should see a professional if those traits affect too much your life.",
            "This test was very accurate, as long as your honest. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I did the test and I had three. I would suggest anyone that might want to know to do this test.",
            "Upon a search of \"disorder\", within the top 10 results I see 3 \"psycnet\" apps, of which one of them is #1 result. While the information is good, (atleast the offline content), it is regurgitated from other sources. The layout of each app is identical, however the icon images on download screen seem \"too\" unique, thereby concealing the relationship until further examination. Its a tad creepy, considering the online \"tests\" and information stored from within the apps.",
            "I've been diagnosed,beginning at a young age,with mental health disorders.Although I enjoy taking online tests such as this,for the most part the results are not indicative of my diagnosis.THIS PARTICULAR SCREENING TEST was extremely accurate, so much so that my first thought(I found myself lmao)was I could have saved innumerable visits and time if only 30 years ago this app had been available for me to stumbled upon. Absolutely \"On Point\"Terrific job devs. Check it out,thank me later, lol.",
            "The test knew exactly what I have. I'm a psych student and I have a personality disorder, so I thought I'd see if the app would guess right. I answered honestly and found myself thinking that because I'm medicated and so mentally healthy right now it wouldn't pick up on it. But when I got to the end, that BPD bar was the only blip and it was sticking straight out. So unless everyone else also got BPD, I'd say this is pretty realistic. Still, I wouldn't rely on this for a diagnosis."

Hope you can grant my request, thanks much.",

I have played many other games that don't run out of videos like this game. Awesome game, if everything worked like it does sometimes. I had tornado gun at lvl 250 an got the bounce gun, but it only went to lvl 220 an wants items to rank up, but every previous gun would level up to the same lvl of the gun I had. Guess it's a way to try an cheat money out of people...",
            "When I try to get triple reward, open chests or anything that requires opening an ad; it says REWARDED video is not ready. I also made a purchase but did not get the secondary weapon!!! Last but not least, you can turn off the music but why do you have to if there is no music at all 🤣 Even after the recent update, the problem still exists",
            "At stage 5 the shielded boss came and my shots are useless. No clue/tutorial to fight him. After 30min, out of frustration I charge myself toward him. Health gone but nothing happens. 10min later I was so frustrated and ready end it all, charged towards the boss, then surprise2, a robot came down. The robot damage the boss so slightly it takes 15 min to kill it. Clearly this game made by a brainless zombie"

Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

        "description": "SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.\r\n\r\nStep 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. \r\n\r\nStep 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.\r\n\r\nStep 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. \r\n\r\nStep 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?\r\n\r\nUsing SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.\r\n\r\nLearn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. \r\n\r\nThank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC.

            "I downloaded this app when it first came out. Ive had no problems with it and it doesn't drain my battery. I truly wish more people would download it, just for the simple fact that it can help each other stay safe. At first I was worried that this was some type of government tracking devise, but it's not, thank God! I truly believe our NC health department is trying to help us remain healthy and I truly appreciate the effort. So far, I've not been in contact with anyone positive and Im thankful!",
            "Little to no impact on my phone performance and battery life. Appears to work as described, but many more people in North Carolina need to install this app. This app can help to slow the spread of Covid-19 by alerting you to early possible exposure to someone who tested positive. This app needs to be promoted more prominently on social media so people will know it's available. I found it by chance on the Google Play app.",
            "I installed it on my Samsung S5 (6.0.1 Marshmallow). I guess it's working, but it has a big flaw: it's a power hog. Until I installed SowCOVIDNC, my phone battery easily lasted a full day. Now I have to recharge by late-afternoon. That's a big problem. Can you please fix it? I'm not going to uninstall it, because it is important. I can live with the power drain, if I have to. But it sure would be a lot better if it didn't drain the battery so rapidly.",
            "Can't enable the app. I downloaded the app then I read how it works then I clicked enable. However it says that there's an internal error and that I should try again. I try again and it keeps saying internal error. It doesn't tell me anything what the problem is. Using a Samsung Galaxy A20 android phone. Would be thankful for any help. Will be checking back. Edit: Thank you for responding. What you told me to do helped tremendously. It works perfectly now.",
            "Excellent and Thank You! I agree with other reviewers, I hope (and will do my part) it is downloaded by as many NC residents as possible. Also - Google's category of \"Health and Fitness\" doesn't apply they need to create a specific Public Safety or Pandemic Level Category, because this app should NOT get bulked in with thousands of fitness and weight trackers and is likely getting lost in the search. Apps like this is essential to keeping us safe, it needs its own Category. Thank you again!"

            "This is the first time that I have written a review for any app. In shirt: I love it. Yes, you have YouTube, Spotify and Soundcloud, but this is different: these are dedicated (endless!) stations without a 'replay' or 'track view' option, designed to reflect a specific mood. I love the low, medium and high energy options and the simple channel range. It does what it says on the can - nothing more and nothing less. It has never crashed for me. I am addicted to the Alpha Chill Medium energy and am listening to it now as I power my way through a report that I am writing on a train trip home. I am all masked up but blissed out on the sounds (despite all these Covid challenges). I do see the points of the various critics and willl beg to disagree. For an annual subscription, the cost is reasonable (remember what we used to pay for one CD!) but it will depend on what you want to use it for. For someone like me who is very easily distracted, anxious or stressed, I love the fact that it's reliable, high quality, and legal. It puts me in The Zone. Amazing. I hope this helps you 👌😊",
            "Content is very helpful for focus for me and my child with ADHD. Some of the calmer stations are also good for meditation. App is a nice, non-distracting interface.",
            "Amazing. I am a female with adhd and this is an awesome app.",
            "Too expensive. Plus, the ADHD playlist seems counterintuitive and didn’t seem to work for me. Though in all fairness, I only tried it two or three times during the limited trial due to my schedule. But yeah, 3 stars sums this app for me.",
            "Crashes after every timed session and won't let me log my productivity. I'm evaluating the free trial and this is making me hesitant to subscribe. Emailed support and have yet to hear back."

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

My time in range is phenomenally good. It's as if I was blind before, but now have glasses to see. I love this app! And I am feeling so much better because my glucose control is better. I have energy, can think/concentrate, have lost weight because I'm no longer \"feeding the insulin, and sleep better.",
            "Once again...for as advanced as the G6 is, the app should be compatible with more than just the \"latest\" IPhone. I have Samsung Fold and was sad to find it wasn't compatible. Only 20% of population has an Iphone. The receiver reminds me of a flip phone I had 10 years ago. Please update for MODERN Android phones.",
            "Another crappy app by dexcom with huge design flaws. It takes forever to produce a report and during that time if the app loses focus (if you switch to another app or if your screen turns off) the report production will cancel without warning and without informing you. So you have to wait several minutes while touching the screen every few seconds to make sure your screen doesn't turn off while the app does its thing. This is ridiculous.",
            "Yeah, it helps me to refine and schedule my meal changes, periods of activity, BG insulin corrections and my exercise program by showing BG pattern changes periodically throughout the previous day. Kudos for a reliable, well-considered app for helping the diabetic and his care team in dealing with the challenges of diabetes!",
            "Extremely helpful. A must needed tool to control and figure out best treatment, like what foods trigger my blood sugar. I keep a low sugar / carb diet. I have a difficult situation. I also take ani rejection meds steroids which cause my blood sugar to go up as well without this app I was always guessing now I know exactly how to control my issues when they're high which they are many times I'm able to correct due to my steroids"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

Depression differs from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to everyday life challenges. Depression may become a serious health condition particularly in case of long-lasting and moderate or severe intensity. It makes the affected person suffer greatly and perform poorly at work, at school and in family. In worst cases depression can lead to suicide. Every year, about 800 000 people commit suicide. Suicide is the second main cause of death among the people aged 15-29.\r\nDespite the availability of known and effective methods of depression treatment, less than half of affected people in the world (in many countries, less than 10%) receive such treatments. Barriers to efficacious treatment include lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers, and social stigma associated with mental disorders. Another barrier to efficacious treatment is inaccurate assessment. In countries of any income level, depressed people are often incorrectly diagnosed, while other people not having this disorder are too often misdiagnosed and prescribed antidepressants. (WHO)\r\nHalf of those who suffer from depression do not seek medical assistance, and only 25-30% of those who are depressed turn to psychiatrists. In some countries, the percentage of those who do not seek medical assistance approaches 90%.\r\nUnipolar depression is the leading cause of disability in the USA among children over 5.\r\nSpecial studies have shown that 60% of patients who turn to polyclinics have depressive disorders of varying severity. Meanwhile, as a result of diagnoses applying traditional medical methods used in polyclinics, depression is revealed in only 5% of all depressed patients who go there.\r\nDepression is diagnosed in 22-33% of hospitalized patients, in 38% of oncological patients, in 47% of patients with stroke, in 45% of patients with myocardial infarction, and in 39% of those with parkinsonism.\r\nNot so long ago, the peak of depression morbidity occurred at the age between 30 and 40 years, but today the depression has abruptly become \"younger\" and it often affects people under 25. Among the people born before 1940, the number of those who recovered from depression before the age of 25 is 2.5%. Among those born in 1940-1959, this indicator is already 10%. There is no exact data for later years, but the growth of this trend is maintained.\r\nIn this application we consider a variety of types of depression. We tell about the causes of depression, the principles of its diagnosis, modern antidepressants and other medicines used for different types of depression. Of course, we talk about ways that psychiatrists and psychotherapists can help you. And most importantly – about the ways you can help yourself!\r\nWe, practicing psychiatrists and psychotherapists, very much hope that:\r\nThe application Depression will help you and thousands of people around the world to understand your feelings, the causes of your suffering, anxiety and despair, the fear of going insane ....\r\nThis application will help you to understand that you are not alone in your illness, and that hundreds of thousands of people around the world are experiencing the same suffering and devastation that you do now.\r\nBut the most important thing that you must understand is:\r\nIf you were diagnosed Depression, it is not a sentence at all!!!\r\nIn a vast majority of cases it can be treated successfully ....",

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

            "Found that I was using the app quite a bit, principally the android tv version that is connected to stereo/receiver. The ads on the free version can get repetitive. Got a premium subscription since I was enjoying having this type of music as background as I worked from home. Hope you will continue to improve android tv and Android versions. (Quicker way to stop music in android tv version if you've exited app, going back into app need to go into playing now to stop.)",
            "Had been working great but last day it just cuts out now. Plays for 10 seconds then cuts out again sometimes for hours. Leave the spa music or zen music up all the time and had been great. Hoping the streaming issues are not the norm.",
            "I was very excited to find Best Folk. Ever, but have been terribly disappointed in it. You play the same songs over and over, are missing dozens and dozens of fabulous folk artists, and play FAR TOO MUCH Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Branch out. Diversify. Why so few folk singers?",
            "Had a problem with the subscription fee and one of your support staff Simon adjusted everything. He also helped me how to program your station to my internet radios. Keep up the good work! Lots of music selections ... love it!",

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "Used to be really good, but there have been a lot of ads recently that make it hard to navigate. If you can get through that, though, the app is functional and intuative. It let's you log a number of other things such as sleep, aches, etc. that allows for complex predictions. There is also a commjnity tab with a hood communtiy and many lady-related articles. Not as good as it used to be, but it still does what it's supposed to.",

            "It is a good app, but more inclusivity would be great. Not only women have periods and changing the word \"woman\" for the word \"person\" in articles sure will halp this app be more enjoyable and useful for all kinds of people."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

Ads only happen if you want to make a bit of in-game cash. I would like to know what an upgrade will get me. \"Improved performance\" and \"more crafting options\" doesn't shed much light on what higher level buildings can do. Haven't found uranium yet.",
            "This game is calm and way different from all those moneysucking mobile games. No annoying ads unless you want some extra currency or speed up some progress. It's amazing how much you can do. There's always something new to explore etc. Its only downside is that the gameplay is extremely slow, but it also has its charms: it gives a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of the road. Dear developer, if you see this, just know that i love your work and can't wait to see what comes next.",

All of the content in the game can be enjoyed by players regardless of their budget. It is a difficut game to get the hang of and so a discord group has been created by the developer to assist players in progressing through the game and allowing them to socialize with other players.",
            "Lots of bugs. Lacks instruction. I have everything that is says for Hydroponics (something needed for the game) yet fails to let me make it. Do I need to research something fails to tell me in the game. There is no close button when you open menus in the game. Pressing on top where close button should be works. Fun game too bad it's so clunky. Five out of five if you fix the issues...",
            "It's a fun game and I like the idea but the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the UI. It jitters when you switch outposts and doesn't register half my taps, meaning you have to press the button twice for it to do something. Developers, if you're reading this, please improve the UI! Make it less jiterry and clunky and I'll up my review to 5 stars."

            "My favorite meditation, music, frequency app. The offerings are the best variety I've seen and I like the customizations you can make to the sound levels in the selfeggio frequency section. You can add in sound elements, like Om, singing bowl strikes, nature sounds and adjust the level of those layers as well. I just purchased the premium and I'm looking forward to exploring everything premium has to offer. Thanks!",
            "Stuttering playback especially on 432 Tibetan, very distracting and unpleasant, after last update it seems to have vastly improved the stuttering, so I have changed my star rating to represent the changes. Some tracks still click and crackle but perhaps that is because my phone. Only problem is that I keep getting notifications to pay for things when I already paid for premium.",
            "I'm not sure what's going on but ever since they did this last update everything is staticky. It don't even have the same effect and it doesn't even sound the same. I don't think that's a good thing considering you have to pay for a membershipand I feel like I'm not getting the most out of that membership now. I might be uninstalling this."

        "comments": [
            "Helps me keep track of when my period weeks are, which my birth control already basically does with the placebo week. I loved this app before it updated to what it is now. Now it is hard to use, it erased my data at one point, and just really doesn't work as well as it used to. Now that I have a new phone, I wanted to sign up for an account to save my data from my old phone, but it keeps giving an error and not telling me if there's even anything that I need to fix to make it work. Honestly just wish they'd roll back the app to what it was. :/",
            "Still not happy with current layout. Why would you update to a less intuitive interface? Edit: Is there a plan to update again? Can you add the previous features back? Before the layout changed, this app was reassuring, satisfying, and easy to use. Having the ability to see all symptom options, and the ones chosen for the day floating inside the days box, all on the main page and visible at once. The nice details are now missing. And this thing is glitchy. It keeps messing up my cycles.",
            "Nothing like it was before the new update. Lots of features missing, including the custom log function. I have it set to send daily notifications and it does not work at all, it did before. It's a shame, really. The app, with what it does have, does what its supposed to do I suppose...except for the notifications.",
            "Since it did the update that renovated the whole app it's hard to use, every week it was giving me reminders that my IUD is up (It's not), it's slow, buggy, and irritating. I enjoyed it much more before they decided to basically turn it into a whole other app, it is nothing like it was before. You ruined your own app! This really sucks because I now feel stuck using it, because I've been using it for years and it's the only app I know of that'll track my cycle with my hormonal IUD",
            "I had stopped using this app for a bit, only to come back to it and it being completely unusable. I hit the log only to not be able to input anything! What's the point? It's almost as though this update was never tested before it was released. This is a 'revert until we fix this bug' type of situation and apologize to all your users. We can wait for an update....a reliable app tracking our periods to make sure we don't get pregnant, becoming unreliable can be life altering. Just a thought. 😡"

            "Really like this app except that it won't let me sign in on multiple devices. I am not the only person who cares for my baby so I need my husband to also have access. I emailed about it a few days ago but haven't heard anything back...",
            "Nice app but now it is not saving my manual pumping data that I input",
            "In trying to be as objective as possible, this app is terrible. It constantly logs you out, then does not accept your password, then you must go through a reset password - all while trying to pump/breastfeed. In addition to not allowing me to log in being a reoccurring issue, I also found several times that my pump session was not stored. While its possible the first few times it could be user error, but since the early days I make it a point to talk out all the steps to make sure I've entered and saved everything correctly. I have not been able to log back in from my phone, and am now using the app through my laptop - which doesn't appear to allow you to log your pumping/breastfeeding sessions. I'm actually looking for an alternate app, because the Medela app is triggered my anxiety far too many times. At this point, my only objective with this app is to (if I'm finally able to log back in from my phone) extract my data. Obviously it cannot be a password issue on my end, if I'm able to login from my computer.",
            "**Since the update things have been going great again! Just wish there was some end user customization available to make being an EP easier. Used to be a good app, now its logged me out and saying I have connection issues which is false as I'm on my wifi now for this review. ALL of my EP sessions are logged in the app and now I can't calculate where I'm at to know what stock I have on hand and I'm hoping to stop pumping soon if I have enough.",
            "It tracks items very well when it works. I get frequent log-outs which is inconvenient when I'm just about to start breastfeeding - it's not like I can tell my baby \"you have to wait\". Also, this past week I'm getting \"no internet connection\" when I am connected - everything else open on my phone is connected but this app suddenly shows \"no internet connection\"."

I have to check the calendar at best to find tasks, at worst I have to refer to the email I was sent. Making the app effectively useless. I can just use a calendar app. That way I can see the info i need at a glance without having to dig for it. UPDATE. I don't see ANY of my projects at all in the app. Just deleted the app. Thanks!!",
            "Lot of issues of login. Very stupid idea login by email. You cannot login into your asana account without using the \"magic email\". There is no option to enter in your password and email combination. Since my email accounts are both Gmail I'd be obliged to logout and login back in each time or create a new account and lose my work. Is it really asking too ...",
