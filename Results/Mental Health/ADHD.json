            "So good first: If you're looking for an easy-to-use app that'll give you all the Pomodoro perks but with also a stopwatch for tasks you don't know the duration of, this is it. And I love the \"distracted\" feature, simple AND useful! Now the bad: The \"sync\", which is why I bought the Premium version, is a mess. I need to manually export each day of each device and then uninstall and reinstall to \"sync\". VERY inconvenient. Also Googlecal, events can be seen but not timed, you gotta create in-app.",
            "I immediately bought premium when I downloaded this app, but I don't regret that at all. The app is clean, practical, and just has a cool aesthetic. This app has a lot lot of tools to offer which have helped me a lot. There are some issues when it comes to syncing with Google calendar, but let's hope that's fixed soon. Premium is also a hella cheap one time purchase and totally worth it imo.",
            "It's the first app I've found that is ADHD focused and it definitely helps me a lot more than other productivity apps. I bought the premium version, it's worth it. Downsides: I think the app could be more colorful, starting with the labels. The all-white theme is so boring. I REALLY wish it was simpler to create events and to be able to turn to-do's into events; sometimes I just need to visualize my week and schedule tasks in a week view since I already use Google Calendar as my events manager.",
            "This app is very useful to regain the concentration by keeping our procrastination aside. But it would be even more nice if at least the statistical development is shown for limited tasks or sessions to know how one can control and controlled themselves. However, this is a very useful app. Thankyou developers and I hope that you might consider my request as a suggestion.",
            "Great app. We can choose if we can pause the session or not. App white list. It has both timer and stopwatch. Can set study, revision and break times and multiple sessions ( though I have noticed it does not take the revision time under total study time, please do consider and add the revision time to total study time.Had to choose 5min/10min, would be better if we could choose in btwn minutes )The to-do with the completion bar is perfect. Happy with it."

            "if someone put very often for all of the questions and the app told them they had adhd, it doesn't mean they do. i was diagnosed by doctors for adhd and adhd is much more than procrastinating, not focusing and fidgeting. plus, there are only 5 questions. i dont reccomend getting this app. go to doctors instead. (DONT self-diagnose !!!)",

Sometimes the concept of getting users help is good but misdiagnosing them can lead them to the wrong path Some minds are very fragile. I have A. D. H. D and it feels this app is mocking the concept of it as joke with just 5Qs.",

But with some polish and links to other sites to shore up his statements and back up information, it's a great start.",

        "description": "Tiimo is a visual planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  \r\n\r\nWith a subscription, you can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\r\n\r\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for people with ADHD and/or autism, and support executive function challenges. People with executive function challenges may struggle with planning, organization, time management, and goal-setting. Our features specifically support these areas. \r\n \r\n** KEY FEATURES ** \r\n\r\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with commonly-made activities, that make scheduling fast and visual, saving time and encouraging consistent routines. \r\n\r\n+ A visual timeline and ongoing nudges (notifications, vibrations and sound) supports time management and focus. \r\n\r\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \r\n\r\n+ Ongoing reminders halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions. \r\n\r\n+ Choose between over 500 icons, unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images, to represent activities visually. \r\n\r\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, a parent and child, or a teacher and child. \r\n\r\n+ With one Tiimo subscription, you can create up to five different schedules. \r\n\r\nTiimo was designed to be the most visual and inclusive planning app ever created!\r\n\r\n** OUR USERS SAY <3 ** \r\n\r\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.” - Aron\r\n\r\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’ - Ayida\r\n\r\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them.

        "descriptionHTML": "Tiimo is a visual planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  <br><br>With a subscription, you can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.<br><br>Tiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for people with ADHD and/or autism, and support executive function challenges. People with executive function challenges may struggle with planning, organization, time management, and goal-setting. Our features specifically support these areas. <br> <br>** KEY FEATURES ** <br><br>+ Pre-made routines, designed with commonly-made activities, that make scheduling fast and visual, saving time and encouraging consistent routines. <br><br>+ A visual timeline and ongoing nudges (notifications, vibrations and sound) supports time management and focus. <br><br>+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. <br><br>+ Ongoing reminders halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions. <br><br>+ Choose between over 500 icons, unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images, to represent activities visually. <br><br>+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, a parent and child, or a teacher and child. <br><br>+ With one Tiimo subscription, you can create up to five different schedules. <br><br>Tiimo was designed to be the most visual and inclusive planning app ever created!<br><br>** OUR USERS SAY &lt;3 ** <br><br>“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.” - Aron<br><br>“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’ - Ayida<br><br>“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.&quot; - Brett <br><br>** Get started with Tiimo today! ** <br>- We financially support neurodivergent partners &amp; creators<br>- We are a small company on a mission to make a big difference<br>- We are 100% ad free and proud of it<br>- We don&#39;t make money selling data<br><br>** PRICING AND TERMS ** <br><br>14 day free trial - after the 14 days: <br>€3.99/month<br>€7.99/month (support us) or <br>€19.99/annually.<br><br>When you subscribe by choosing one of our plans and confirming your purchase, the payment will be charged to the credit card linked to your Play Store account after the free trial period is over.

            "I really like this app, but there are a few glitches. I am unable to add/save items to the activity checklist as it is intended. It either doesn't save any or duplicates the first one. I also have to add one at a time, very specifically, in order for any to save. After about five successful items like this, it tries to duplicate the first one. Also, I am unable to have any activities with a checklist repeat weekly. I hope this gets fixed! Also, more offline capabilites would be great. :)",
            "I feel this app should be marked as in beta. It's so close to being great. I love that I can add my own photos or download a svg files to make my own icons. Roatines have to be my favorite. However I hate that I can't edit them once created. I have to delete the old roatine and make a whole new one. The app also doesn't work fully without logging on to the computer version. I've read the what's coming section and it's all very exciting. Number one problem- I can't mute the alarm.",
            "So far it's been kind of helpful but I desperately need the app to not throw a fit when I schedule things that overlap (I'm often doing things when I'm supposed to take my meds, these things don't conflict but rather its important that I take my meds in the middle of what I'm doing) also I'd find this worlds more helpful if I didn't have to schedule everything but could rather enter tasks that have to get done at some point that day with no stressful time limit",
            "I've only had the app for just over a week. And it has helped me so much get the chaos in my head straightened out. The use of icons and the time mechanic is perfect for me. And for some reason the layout doesn't make me feel silly putting the little daily routine things in along side daily activities and appointments, which for me is perfect. Hope this makes sense. Great job can't wait to see how it improves over time. 👍",
            "Couple bugs here and there (editing time slots of current events doesn't do anything) but as someone with ADHD, I love the concept and subscribed for a year. I like it on my WearOs watch, but I wish the main clockface could be changed or always-on. I BEG of you, however, to make a version for Samsung watches (Tizem OS). You're missing out on a large community of who would benefit from this! I'm considering unsubbing since I plan on getting another non WearOS watch this fall."

Instead there's this weird implication that adhd can just be cured through persistence & it's not that simple unless you lay on so much pressure that you traumatize your kid into chronic depression. Please don't use this without the guidance of a doctor (and preferably also an adult with adhd who can explain how it feels first hand.)",

Aan de andere kant kan het ook zijn dat de huisarts ADHD niet (tijdig) herkent. Hierdoor kunnen kinderen onnodig schade oplopen en dat kan hun functioneren negatief beïnvloeden.\r\n\r\nIn deze game heeft de huisarts een virtuele spreekkamer waar de ouder en kind of volwassen patiënt met klachten op consult komt. Het is aan de speler om via de juiste vragen de anamnese af te nemen en te bepalen wat er aan de hand is met de patiënt. De speler slaat zijn bevindingen over de patiënt op in een virtueel patiëntendossier.\r\n\r\nAls de speler het protocol goed doorloopt, zorgvuldig ‘kijkt en luistert’ , komt hij tot de juiste diagnose en kan hij al dan niet behandelen of verwijzen.

This valuable new tool provides inspiring stories to help you reach the finish line each day, and whether you prefer to read or listen - daily coaching is a great way to kickstart your day with inspiration.",
        "comments": [
            "It's a good app, but the alarms aren't as customizable as I'd like, and some of the elements are a little confusing. It took me way too long to figure out how to delete and reorder things, it's not as intuitive as HabitRPG. That being said, it's nice to have a community to participate with- or not. Either way is acceptable, and no feeling left out or pushed in. Useful tool for helping serious change, one day at a time.",
            "This app is amazing, but geared heavily towards women. As a person trying to build a more masculine frame and personality using this app seems a little bit counterproductive to my goals. In my opinion, this app would receive a 5-star rating and high praise if it were gender-neutral. Over all, a very good app. Clean interface, detailed, motivatinf, and easy to use.",
            "It's a really sleek and informative app. I'm just on the trial bit so far so good :-) I wanted to add - after two years of using this app, I am finally beginning to live the life I know I deserve and have worked so hard to achieve. The Fabulous has been an invaluable tool in helping me stay focused and achieve goals one step at a time. Thank you so much ❤️",
            "This app has given me space to do something just for me, which as a new mom can be tricky! I really like the journeys and goals and habits, but I find that the interface isn't super user friendly and I often find features by accident and then have no idea how to get back to them. Maybe I need to play around more, but it would be nice if there were less hidden nooks and crannies, so to speak. Overall, love it and am so thankful for it!",
            "I uninstalled this app from my phone recently, then found that I had paif £45.99 for a year's premium at 50% discount. I have no recollection of this....... but no proof either. I've just cancelled all pre-approved payments on Paypal to avoid anything like that happening again. In the meantime, I've got use of the app for another 12 months and so might as well use it. It's not worked brilliantly for me - it's basically a habit tracker."

But as someone thats been using this app for years...two thumbs way way down on the updated look. Its not easy on the eyes, the ads on the bottom are a wicked turn off, just overall disappointed. Wish I didn't update it.",
            "Used to be really good because it was simple. Now the minimalist design was replaced with 2 new features that have no tutorial or detailed explanation on how to properly use. Here's the problem, there's too much inputting and figuring out. Blocks vs Routines vs Programmer? I preferred simply making different weeks, copying them and slightly alternating them if anything pops up.",
            "Really enjoyed this app, but was disappointed to find it doesn't automatically sync your schedule to your account. I had to reset my phone and was bummed to see the schedule, routines, and tags I worked on for days, tweaking it to fit my kid's days perfectly was gone. Not sure I will take the time to redo it and will probably not use the app anymore although I really did like it. If you do use it, just make sure you back up your schedule!!",

Some people might not go for that but in reality it would help the developers to be better funded so they could make the app the best of its kind. Is timetune the best? no. Its potential is incredible though and I really like the approach and Design.",
            "Hi TimeTune, I love your app since then. I just have a problem. I don't know how to fix the blockage of TimeTune app on my Infinix Hot 9. Your site for troubleshooting is not accessible for me. Overall this app is fine and satisfying. Edit. Troubleshooting doesn't work on Infinix Hot 9. Hoping for its inclusion on troubleshooting sites. Edit. I can't find any forums. I am hoping for more improvements in the future. I'll be reinstalling the app after the update."

Stand alone web version also good, widget isn't great, but all around a very solid app. No intrusive ads, and a robust free version that is still worth using it you don't want to pay the monthly fee. Highly recommend trying it out.",
            "This for me is the best planner app I have come across. I have tried and used many apps. But each one lacked some or the other feature. But Ticktick has all the features I need and the app is so easy to use. This app is helping me plan better, stay organized and get things done. Keep up the great work.",
            "This app is very, very well written. In particular the browser version is very intuitive and easy to use when adding sub-tasks and just in general. It has a modest subscription fee to use the full monthly calendar, and it is very well worth it. I test drove around 5-6 other apps and ended up liking this one the best and it makes sense that this is on the Editor's Choice list. Well done TickTick.",
            "This app has changed the entire course of my life. From health to relationships and productivity. This app is a life saver. One suggestion: regarding habits it would be good if it has all the quotes relating to that habit and so those quotes (maybe along with pictures?) pop up every day on reminder and motivate you. As am example If I want to go to gym, in reminder I am shown random quote written on some inspirational picture.",
            "I've been looking for an app like this for ages! Finnaly found! The best todo app in the world. For me much much better than todoist where you have to pay even for reminders (sic!). Here you have almost everything for free. You have to try it!"

            "I love this app but one of the main paid features does not work. I want to download my entries to send to my therapist but the report output is incorrect. The emotions don't match with the correct day, the time of the entries show only the time you downloaded the report and it doesn't include any of the recorded cognitive dysfunctions I logged. I'm really disappointed and will be checking out other/similar apps and won't be sticking with the paid version after the free trial.",
            "Thus far, I say that this app was perfectly created! So far, what I've seen is very well organized & contains helpful lessons, informational videos, a personal journal, and more! This dovetails nicely with my weekly therapy - I'm feeling ecstatic! I definitely plan to tell my counselor and the members in my Zoom DBT group about this great app!",
            "Could be a good app, but I keep adding entries and they just don't get saved. It is not very intuitive to use, it rather stresses me out. Also a lot of content is not free, and the subscription seems quite expensive.",
            "Is this your app a good one? I've downloaded it about 40 minutes ago but it can't open. Why does it require an email, a username, and a password to open? Meanwhile, there are other expensive psychology apps which do not require these. In any way, I've provided the requirements but the worse part of it is that the verification code can't be sent. I have only wasted my 35mb of data. I didn't know this is a fake app. I thought it was going to help me as a psychology student.",
            "I'm a training child psychiatrist and wanted to test run this before offering it to patients. For now I'd hold off as I don't expect clinically meaningful results. Ideas are taken from cbt but the structure and organization do NOT follow cbt. Was the best available app, but a $15 cbt book on Amazon is still superior in content, organization, and clarity. Pair it w free habit tracker and you're better off. Recent release is dysfunctional. Not easy to navigate. Only anxiety lessons can be found."

The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",

Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

            "Amazing app. One of the main reasons I like having a smart watch is to keep track of my appointments on my wrist, and this has been one of, if not the best way I've tried of having easy visual access to my daily agenda. The visuals is seeing the hand move towards my meetings and the time listed until then is a great touch as well",
            "Requires you to link your device calendar. Doesn't actually store your schedule, just provides a fancy UI for the calendar for some is the calendar features you're already using. It even opened your existing calendar to create events. I don't want to clutter up my existing calendars, or risk breaking important things, to try this out. It really needs to stand alone unless I choose to integrate with my existing calendar.",
            "I bought the pro version. It's a really great app... Simple clock widget to display all my plans for the day... I used it on my smart watch n it's really useful. I don't know if it's a bug or not, but when I touch the event on the phone widget and it shows the detail, after that when I touch the \"X\" button it wont go back to the clock face but open the Calendar instead. And I can't move the watch hands around to see the othe upcoming events. I hope there'll be update about these. Thanks alot",
            "Love it, great time management app, one thing I think would be great is if you guys would add a feature where it shows like a chart of all your time from the past say like past year, so you can see where you are spending your time cumulatively, instead of just the chart of how you spend your time each day, which is still super helpful! But adding a chart of how you spent your time in the past would be great! Would love to see that feature perhaps on an update of the app!",
            "I don't usually do reviews but this app is honestly quite great. It really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when I open to my home screen. My only complaint is that it does end up crowding my calendar app because it requires you to add an event to the calendar but past that, it's pretty great. Most planner apps don't work but this blew it out of the park"

            "Beautiful app, with great instruction. It really helps with knowing deeper mindfulness. I have practiced meditation and mindfulness for over 10 years. Perhaps adding the option of music during the meditation might be the only improvement I would make... and possibly lengthen the log area just about 20-30 more characters for logging ideas. Thanks again for providing the app.",
            "I love this app! It really works if you give it a chance, it's also something from the Government that's REALLY FREE! I been suffering from PTSD for over 20 years. Living on a fixed income makes it impossible to afford someone elses income. Just by hapenstance I found this & I thank God that I have a way to calm myself down on/in those \"uncomfortable\" times.",
            "Neat, clean, simple, and simply the best meditation app. No ads, no subscriptions - just mindfulness. Kudos to the great work! Note: used to be buggy when I tried a year or two ago. But now (as of summer 2020) it is totally bug-free and faultless.",
            "Such an awesome app that too free of cost...the mindfulness exercise they provide I thought they will charge for it because they are so helpful and for every thing in your life a mindfulness is present whether for emotional distress,nap,sleep, eating,walking everything...thank you so much the developers..god bless you ❤️",
            "By far one of the best and cleanest and most simple mindfulness app I have ever used. The lessons are very helpful too, you can really tell this was created out of good and kind intentions: to help others be more self-aware in order for us to execute decisions thought about thoroughly. Thank you so much!"

            "Great concept and game. As to be expected with any newly published app there are bugs. From my device (Moto G5 on Android 8.1.0) The only major bug seems to be that when I click match it doesn't register as a match, or it also registers an incorrect match. It's hard to tell because the only way I've noticed this is seeing the number of incorrect matches at the end of the game. When in fact, I know I pressed the match button as soon as I seen a sequence repeated. *Nootropics group member",

            "I like the concept of this app, but there are some flaws, even with the paid for full version, which are pretty annoying, I think: 1. You cannot modify or reassign the videos shown of the preinstalled tasks 2. You cannot add videos to a new task 3. When you are done with a task, but swiped too far and you have to go back to previous task, it gives you the stars again, as if you had completed the task again 4. Limited amount of tasks you can add yourself 5. You cannot change the task symbols",
            "Amazing app!!!! Love it!!😍😍 I am just 10 years old....This isn't my own phone though and not my own account😆.....Anyways, this app helps me in every way..... I always wanted something like this app.... I was searching and found this app.... After installing it is the most favourite app in the whole device.....I never used to do anything on time and did everything in the last minute so I know this will help you too.And I hope you also make the same thing for afternoon chores. Install it!!!😃😃",

            "Really wish I could do countdowns longer than an hour, was planning on using it for 2 hour increments. Otherwise everything about this is just great, a simple non-distracting timer that gives you an idea of how much time is left without having you just waste time counting the seconds. Everything you need, nothing you don't. Just really wish I could do longer timers.",
            "Simple, effective, and free! This is what I was looking for to help manage time more efficiently. I needed a timer for my kids' schoolwork and decided on this app based on the reviews. I'm glad I did! The timer presets work well without any ads or unnecessary permissions. It's refreshing! I donated to support! We need more developers like this.",
            "Love the app, would be 5 stars, but I keep getting \"unexpected countdown state\" when stopping the alarm while the phone is locked 🤷‍♂️ #Update - I set a timer and lock the phone. When it reaches zero, the timer comes up on screen, but attempts to hit stop (to stop the alarm) fail. I have to unlock the phone, then hit stop. The alarm stops, but I also get the \"unexpected countdown state\" message.",
            "Simple, clean timer that has enough features to make it flexible. I've been using it as a pomodoro timer for school work and it's nice to be able to make presets. Fewer touches, more work!",
            "I spent nearly 2 hours to find this application. All I wanted is an app that can do the following: Allow the user to setup a bunch of tasks each: With its own timer period With its own ringer / alarm Allow the user to: Start a task at a time of their choice Be alerted via a ringer / alarm when task's time period is over Allow the user to look at statistics Chart how frequently a task is done Chart the time of day when a task was done Though this is a big ask, it will be good, if the data of the app use can be exported in a standard format for review / analysis by desktop applications. To require phone to review and analyze is something that could / should be avoided."

            "Good. Ads are so minimal on the free version which is refreshing. Sometimes I find the instructions don't make sense, so you have to pause and think. But I suppose that's good because we are training our brains to get better. I'm using this because I had a brain tumour removed and I'm trying to get my cognitive abilities back. Using this gives me a great sense of accomplishment, and benchmarks for areas of improvement",
            "Great! Some problems/concerns: - time to read a task description should not be counted - better to not just choose a random exercises, but consider what a user was working on recently, cuz sometimes the app gives me the same one multiple times in a row - more statistics, please, so that I can track day to day progress - more exercises? Premium should help, but still",
            "So as others have already stated...why does the timer countdown when you are reading how to do the different brain exercises. That is not fair at all. If I'm new and learning how to play them for the first time the timer shld not start....and you should have a 30-60second to learn how to play it before jumping right into the exercise. Other than that I love the exercises and I'll keep training my 🧠.",
            "Great little brain games that I'm hoping will really make a difference in my brain strength over time! Lol. Only 4 stars instead of 5 though because I could be doing better on the game's if we had more clear instructions for Each game provided to us. Like Examples of exactly how.to do each game would be Great! 👌🏽😁",
            "Just what I needed! Beautifully designed app! I'm trying to improve my executive functioning because of what I think is the \"COVID Long Haul\" brain fog & forgetfullness. I also have ADHD & PTSD. This app is engaging like a game but not so addictive that it takes over my brain when I have something else I NEED to do. If it proves to have longer term benefits I will try to update this review. 😊"

            "amazing! this simple and funny app really pushes me to do things i hate to do! my sister really applauds me for this. can you please also make the timer act like a stopwatch that starts with 00:00 or countdown timer that makes it hours rather than minutes? they are easier to track. In addition, i would love to have this in Windows version so that i would not keep looking at my phone which can be disruptive (and also the fact that the phone light would go off in certain time to save battery). thanks and keep up the amazing job!",

I have ADHD and it's so useful to help me complete tasks, even if I only accomplish the first few. 8do wish that when a break ends it would automatically bring you back to the app and start the timer again. Also is there any purpose to asking the user's gender at the beginning of a task?",

            "I do love the app. I have several problems though. Whenever I make a recurring task it won't complete. I will slide it to the side but it won't record the progress, though it says it does. And it will just stay in uncompleted. Don't know if this is a glitch but it's annoying. Also you can't download your own notification sounds and the notification options are a little confusing.",
            "A RIP-OFF! So far I really enjoyed the app itself. However unlike other apps it doesn't have a normal and a premium version. It just has a normal version and makes you pay for every little thing if you want to change the color you have to pay for each individual color. If you want to use the widget mode, you have to pay for that. It would be much easier and better if they had a one time payment for premium version. This way is such a ripoff and it's not worth it! Such a scam.",
            "Wow..great app. I just start using this app. To be able to keep track of your daily task and at the end of the day complete a report of the day. It is amazing. Plus it show the percentage of accomplishment. It keep you motivate every single day to keep doing better. It always an excitement to do list for tomorrow. Well done.",
            "I love it. Its SO HELPFUL! It would be nice if a background image could be added to the tasks, but that has nothing to do with functionality. In that regard, the app is flawless.",
            "I have just started using this app and I am very excited that it has the ability to schedule tasks on certain days of the week for each month. That's a feature I have been looking for for a while. I wish there was a feature for yearly or biyearly scheduling. That would make this app perfect"

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "This is the first time that I have written a review for any app. In shirt: I love it. Yes, you have YouTube, Spotify and Soundcloud, but this is different: these are dedicated (endless!) stations without a 'replay' or 'track view' option, designed to reflect a specific mood. I love the low, medium and high energy options and the simple channel range. It does what it says on the can - nothing more and nothing less. It has never crashed for me. I am addicted to the Alpha Chill Medium energy and am listening to it now as I power my way through a report that I am writing on a train trip home. I am all masked up but blissed out on the sounds (despite all these Covid challenges). I do see the points of the various critics and willl beg to disagree. For an annual subscription, the cost is reasonable (remember what we used to pay for one CD!) but it will depend on what you want to use it for. For someone like me who is very easily distracted, anxious or stressed, I love the fact that it's reliable, high quality, and legal. It puts me in The Zone. Amazing. I hope this helps you 👌😊",
            "Content is very helpful for focus for me and my child with ADHD. Some of the calmer stations are also good for meditation. App is a nice, non-distracting interface.",
            "Amazing. I am a female with adhd and this is an awesome app.",
            "Too expensive. Plus, the ADHD playlist seems counterintuitive and didn’t seem to work for me. Though in all fairness, I only tried it two or three times during the limited trial due to my schedule. But yeah, 3 stars sums this app for me.",
            "Crashes after every timed session and won't let me log my productivity. I'm evaluating the free trial and this is making me hesitant to subscribe. Emailed support and have yet to hear back."

            "AVOID! Do not pay for this app. Can't believe I got sucked in by the fake positive reviews. This app is completely broken and or potentially a scam. It looks great at first glance, actually useful even, but in its current state is completely unusable. The To-Day tab randomly mixes up times of day, placing Morning after afternoon followed by morning again... The Daily+ tab is completely broken again randomly re-ordering tasks in the View All/WakeUp/Morning/etc tabs this makes the app essentially useless. The MyDay tab adds incorrect completed habits, which then change again seemingly at random to different tasks...again making this feature useless. Poor translation throughout the app which would be forgivable if it weren't for the crazy price being charged. Which is my biggest gripe. The use of clearly fake reviews and that the developer think its acceptable to charge for something so completely broken is appalling. Will do my best to bring this Google's attention. Very disappointing indeed.",
            "I have a moto g6, didnt work. I really liked the set up of this app so I paid for the notification/alarm reminders on it, but they did not work and it makes the app useless to me. I gave it all the permissions it requested and nothing. I did receive a refund though. Next time I upgrade my phone I'll look for this app again, maybe it'll work on a different phone.",
            "I was going to try the trial and then the annual fee. The annual fee is listed as $27.99/y but when I went to sign up it said $54.99/y. This comes across as really dishonest and shady. Will not be subscribing.",
            "It's only alright. Not worth paying for at all. Doesn't keep habits in order it mixes them up even if you sort them by time of day. It's a very simple concept and executed poorly.",

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

Brili has star rewards for completing tasks, and then kids trade them in for rewards. I'd like to see routinery do this for adults, because there are several things about brili that make it harder for adults to use on themselves. The thing is, adhd adults need that reward motivation. Please incorporate the reward structure into this great app!",

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

I kind of wish they had courses for specific mental illnesses like depression anxiety and eating disorders though but that's the only really thing I can think of at the moment that I'd change.",

            "Setting up medications is REALLY confusing. There are dozens of formulations that are in the list, but their missing Amphetamine salts, which, in my experience, is a common label for generics. That pretty much stopped me there. A quick look at the other 'tools' and, well, not very descriptive. Overall, this app strikes me as an 'everything for everyone'. I don't know where they got their knowledge base data, but they need to do more research. Some treatment providers claim to treat adult ADHD, but will only use dosages appropriate for children and adolescents and stop there, in spite of guidelines for adults being available. More often than not, adults are undertreated. This app would just muddy up treatment.",

            "I like it for now but even after buying the premium version there are a limited number of categories. I have 3 businesses & thus the single briefcase icon doesn't work for me. I would like to be able have a different category icon for each of my various tasks & a larger range of icon options of categories available. There isn't even an icon for pets ! That is super important !",
            "Almost perfect. There's only one feature I'd like it to have that it doesn't: modify start of the week. To Europeans it makes absolutely no sense to start the week on a Sunday, which throws off my quantifications. I bought premium, but will update my review if this is added. Edit : it worked, thanks!",
            "It beautifully displays, tracks, and reports all of my important habits that I want to develop. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an option to set recurring tasks - things that I need to do regularly, but that aren't necessarily vital to my personal development. I paid for the full version, but actually stopped using it because I don't like that it won't differentiate between a habit and a recurring task. Looking for something to better suit my needs ...",
            "Reminder Notification Not Notified When It's Time That I have set. At first it working well, but now idk what happened. I checked every settings in app and my phone settings there seems to be normal. Edit: Okay. MB It's Huawei Battery Optimizer that auto optimized the app in default settings, I'd forgotten. Star added to 4, I know this app could be better than this ex. Add option for habit that already mark as done today getting no more notifications.",
            "One of my biggest problem I was not so persistent and regular. Also I always tend to forget task. Habit tracking, task tracking and reminder helped me. It's like, a part of myself changed that day when I decided to install it. It's worth purchasing premium version. I really love the widget on my Home screen. Winners' secret of success is always hidden in their daily routine, so this app is highly recommend from my side. A REQUEST TO DEVELOPER TEAM, PLEASE DON'T STOP OR TURN DOWN THIS APP, EVER."

            "This is very informing and a very nice platform to learn a Lot. Or just to stay brain active. Each read is not too long or short and I love the quizzes. Very nice app. First and only one I stuck to reading from in fact.",
            "New user. The page layout is nice and intuitive. However, the articles so far are disappointing. They are lightweight with little substantial or new information.",
            "Good app. Content is easy enough to read and digest. Could do with a regular change of content, as I often scroll and see the same posts for weeks. Also, by way of UI, there is a huge ad banner that covers a big block of content, which I feel cheapens the overall interface. More discreet ads would make for a more user driven design, while seeing to your revenue.",
            "So during the time that I've actually had this app I've not utilize it as much as I would like but the information and knowledge gained each time I do access the application meets or exceeds expectations. There really is a plethora of information to be gained here and it's easily accessible, navigation is easy & smooth no problems with this app but am rather interested in the premium version. it's actually really great for those few minutes you have to spare to read something informative."

Another app I use called Engross has a great one, it allows you to count how many times you get distracted and is more flexible for example. Also I would like to copy my to-do's to the Routine instead of having to writing it there again. That's all I need to buy premium and switch completely to this app. :)",

            "I have been looking for the perfect app to manage my schedule and tasks. This app is a perfect combination. Clear and friendly user interface and does exactly what it says. Very few apps out there that will give you the same clarity and effectiveness. Only thing I would improve is the calendar. Would be nice to be able to also add future events, beyond the current week you're on and also have the option of seeing the month as a whole as well as week by week."

            "I think this is a really great app with awesome features, even for free. I ended up purchasing the upgrade because I enjoyed the app so much in the free version already, and wanted to support the devs. However, I wish there was an option to mass delete records instead of going in 1 by 1, I was exploring the multiday record feature and accidentally gave myself 60 new records, which I had to delete 1 by 1.",
            "Love this application, though it's simple still useful and easy to work with. But... Minus a star for not recognising Cyrillic characters - question marks in report files plus font size is too small for a 10\" screen. Maybe developers don't know that there are users using tablets as well as smartphones. Also it would be nice to have 3 levels - project, its subs and their tasks and statistics for all of them (look at Gleeo Time). Task Start Area is quite narrow, in 95% cases it calls Task Edit.",
            "Neat productivity app, a bit barebones in places and the UI isn't terribly intuitive, but it's simple to learn and very solid once you get the hang of it. I use it to keep track of time spent on different hobbies and it's nice to be able to keep track of time goals for each day and week and see cumulative time spent.",
            "Love love love!!! Best time tracker app Ive tried. Its clean and easy to use. Some suggestions that would make me love it even more would be tobe able to show data for tasks per project.",
            "Great App! I have been using it for a while now and am convinced that it is the best designed time tracking app out there :) What I do miss a little bit is to be able to mark projects as billable so it would make my work life easier. Also I would like to be able to set \"goals\", so I could say I would like to work 8 hours daily, I would get notified when I reached the 8 hours. That would be really cool! :)"

We plan on adding more languages in future updates.<br>- Notification volume reminder! (Optional) Reminder to increase notification/ringtone volume to hear notifications at the end of your study session.",

            "The best application ever I found the all thanks to developers and there are some suggestion below 1. Structure of bunny might better. 2. Add some curiosity to app for focus. 3. I aspect some more motivational quotes during studies and breaks. Once again thanks to the developers.",
            "Very cute study app! I really appreciate the amount of customisation for my bunny and the timer setting and catigoration options work like a charm! :3 would love to see a skateboard added for my bun bun :3",
            "It has no ads It shows ads only if we want extra add. This app have a motivation to study, you can collect coins after studying and change the Bunny's costume and also decorate the room",
            "This is super cute and I kind of love the wonky aesthetic. Reminds me of flash games I grew up on. Everything about it is great; tagging, flashcards, timer, stats and rewards. The only issue I had waswhen using the stopwatch, my phone screen would turn off, but the app would turn off with it. This didn't happen in the default timed mode. Also if I could make a suggestion, the to do list could send out notifications, like reminders on your phone especially for something planned for way ahead.",
            "It's good. Lets you set a timer for whichever activity you desire, and adds it to a schedule where you can see how much time was spent on each task. Only suggestions I have is to add a sound when the timer is over. The first two times I had to check because I was very sure the 30 mins had passed, but the app didn't let me know. I would also like the option to add task in the schedule manually, without going through the timer."

Also, if I sort task according to priority, why can't I move tickets to the top or bottom between each other?! For example, I have 5 high priority tasks, I want to have possiblity move task 4 to the top, but I can't!!! Please, fix it.",
            "I'm a premium user. Please add an option to add/remove projects in a folder. I accidentally forgot 2 put 2 projects in a folder and I simply can't fix it unless I delete my projects and restart! Unless I'm missing something very obvious, but even on pc I can't seem to fix it (folders don't even show up on my pc) For the rest the app is quite good. I would give 5 stars if you fixed this issue (and maybe also make it possible to change project color in the app? Now I have to do this on my pc)",
            "UI is beautifully designed but UX is the worst I have ever faced. Far too much nagging. Literally pop up after pop up telling me to review on every timer end and pop up saying did the timer stop while in background go to settings. Look, just show it once and it's fine. people using this app are stupid. The app is too slow, even though I'm on an S10+, so that I would press start, it won't respond so I try to press it again, but it just happen to respond at that time, so the timer stops.",
            "While this app is quite powerful, I've noticed a couple things. First, there is no dark mode. Everything is white. As an avid dark mode user, I like to save my eyeballs and forego the blinding white lights. Second, the date format. I'm in the U.S. I've been conditioned to write the date as mm/dd/yyyy instead of switching the month and the day. Current format is day first then month. Please add a setting to choose date format!",
            "I loved the app and purchased the free version. I use the windows version on my computer and recently installed the android version. Now for the last 2 weeks, my progress is not getting saved accurately on my windows version. It is extremely disheartening when you have put in loads of Pomodoros in a day, and none of it is saved the next day including thr completed task. I want to give you 5 stars. Please fix the issue."

            "It's a very good up to learn skills for parenting situations. I enjoy the short chapters, interactive summaries at the end, the videos are lovely quality and they talk to you in a way you still learn but not to getting overwhelmed with too much scientific jargons. It is also enjoyable as a wind down after a hard day with your toddler ☺️ or to find answers for a situation you had on the day, how could I do better. Thanks for them to give this tool to us for free, it is deeply appreciated!",
            "I am so impressed with this app. I have learned such a tremendous amount in my lessons and look at things totally different. I am excited to do more and plan on sending this to all my friends and family so we can all evolve together. Also, I'm hard of hearing, not only does the caption actually work (a lot don't) on the videos, you can read the transcripts of the videos,I love that!",
            "This app is so well designed and the information in it is presented in very thoughtful and easy to digest segments with a small recap quiz after each short video to solidify your learning. I am so grateful that I am able to access this for free! The quality of the apps design; the expertly curated information; and the production value of the videos make the experience feel like I am enrolled in a really expensive course. Thank you so much!!!",
            "I dont usually bother to review apps but this is amazing & after only the first set of videos how I see my kids & their needs had changed. The videos are bitesized & packed with information from professionals & have a short recap questionnaire after each one to make sure you haven't missed anything. I was honestly waiting to be asked for payment for further access. It doesn't happen, it's completely free. 👍from me 100% totally worth checking, you have nothing to lose & everything to gain.",
            "I recently started using this app because I wanted to do some sort of parent training. It has been one of the most educational apps I've seen for parenting, they use lots of nuero scientific information to help you understand your child, how their brain functions, how you can create deeper bonds with your children. I think every parent could benefit from the quick short lessons they have and you only need a few minutes a day to make your relationship with your kids more strong. Highly recommend"

            "I really, really enjoy the app... But I bought the subscription for a year, and it never loaded. The exact dollar amount was taken off my debt card. I'm giving it 4 stars, when normally I would 1 star an app for taking my money. However, their customer support is outstanding!! 🤗 💕",
            "This was recommended to me. I am interested in cognitive health. It was fun and engaging. I can see the benefit of interacting with these games everyday. I want to do more.",
            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",
            "I like the app. The only thing that truely bothers me is that there is not a mute button/setting to mute the music while playing the games."

            "Pretty addicting in a positive way. Pretty beneficial for encouraging me to do my assignments in an addicting way. 😄 There are 2 things i want the game to add though: leave the screen on when i use the focus timer, just like the other Foretst does. I don't like constantly unlocking my phone just to check how much time i have left in a focus session ; add a chat function for the group members(maybe, but not really necessary)",
            "It's a really good app, very motivating, cute graphics. However, the only thing I dislike is the (seemingly unnecessary) distinction between 'focus time' and 'pomodoro time'. The latter doesn't show up on the weekly graph and doesn't count towards the group farming either. I find it very frustrating and, again, unnecessary. I hope you can fix this.",
            "To think the app is supposed to help you stay away from your phone it surely tries really hard to make you spend time in the app. You can plant your plants quite comfortably even without doing the focus sessions. The \"21 days to form a habit\" streak is not really based on if you come and focus but if you log in, watch an add and pick up your daily reward. The design is cute, the idea is nice, but it really is a lot more of a game and less of a focus tool.",
            "Great app! Has adorable animations and includes pomodoro! The problem with this is the fact at time when I'm doing a session it bugs out and say I failed so much to the point where I have to watch a video every session. I understand ad revenue but if it's done unintentionally and disruptive to the point of where I cant do a session without saying I failed every time then that's a problem.",
            "It's fun, but I find it weird that an app that's made for staying off the phone uses the same tactics other apps use to keep people hooked (ie waiting times). I would give 5 stars but I can't figure out how to sync other apps. I had to whitelist this on Forest, so I haveto start my timer on Forest then go to this app and start the timer"

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

            "We used to love this app. When we got it in February there were enough free tracks to make it useable. When covid came the whole thing was free. It was a lovely bonus. But now there is only 1 free track in each of the meditation sections. They are the shortest ones. It's v disappointing. We looked at buying the app but it is way too expensive. The amount being charged is what I would expect to pay for a year, not a month. Tbh it feels quite money grabbing.....not in the spirit of well being",
            "Update: Ninja Focus kindly opened up a bunch of the content for an extended period. We are back to happily using it for the time being. Thank you Ninja Focus! Loved until the update. Our 6 month trial ran out or something, now so much of it is locked. We do use it every night and my son absolutely loves falling asleep listening to the stories and music. I am now looking for a free app, as this one is expensive to purchase a membership.",
            "I was unimpressed when the update came out and the app came with a monthly fee. After speaking with the app developers they have listened to my concerns and respond really reasonably. The app is a great ground to open up conversations about emotions and thoughts with my son's. We love it as a family and I hope we can continue to use in the future.",
            "Originally, this app was wonderful. I used it every night and always had great sleeps, I gave it 5 stars! Since this update however, It takes about 20 taps for me to select something and the app constantly crashes. Reading other reviews I found that I wasn't the only one with this issue! What has happened? Is there any way to fix it???",
            "What a bummer used and loved for my son's now updated and I have to pay. As a single mother of two boys who is currently employed part time due to covid and everything else with school and education happening at home this AP was a respite and a way to connect and slow down with my son's teaching them and watching grow through mindfulness. Did the upgrade and now all of their favorite meditations and yoga are locked unless I but As we are unsure of our meals for the week I can not"

            "I downloaded a few habit trackers and this proved to be the most simple and effective. On the whole, it's a really good app. However, there is one little bug: I turned notifications off but still recieve them. They briefly appear then quickly disappear but it still makes a buzz/sound. It can be quite annoying. Will update review to 5/5 stars once fixed.",
            "I love how simple this is! It's helped me focus on those important things that I want to accomplish. I just wish there was space for more than 5 free habits!!! This means, if you decide to track something else in that space, then you'll lose the data, unless of course you write it down before changing it. This is why it loses a star, in my opinion. It's the best FREE habit tracker I've found! A lot of other apps have free trials, which I don't even bother with.",
            "Simple, direct, easy to use. However, I do wish they wouldn't preemptively set your percent success rate to 97% if you haven't performed the habit yet that same day. As long as you input the completion of the habit before midnight, it should stay at 100%. But super small aspect.",
            "Widgets don't work unless you open the app, and sometimes you then you even have to take an action or two within the app. Wish this product was maintained. Have emailed the developer, but they didn't get back to me. The app doesn't even support logging out, anymore. The usual uninstall/reinstall didn't work.",
            "Great for progress. Their motivation quotes stopped working. Plus it doesn't remember which habit you were last viewing... so a pain in the ass \"weekly\" intrusive display. I specifically looked for this app. Because it's simple and easy on the eyes."

            "Been using this for a few years, it's super helpful. Keeps me organized on various tasks I need to do. I use it daily. I love that I can set a reminder for something I only do once or twice a year. I eventually bought the full version since I use it so regularly. The only change I would like is a calendar view (instead of a list) so I can see several days at a glance & how many tasks I have for each day. I want to evenly spread out the house work so that I don't have too much on any given day.",
            "I have been using this app for well over a year and love it! The customizable tasks paired with the already made master list made it easy for me to begin using. I absolutely adore the timer function. Housework is a beast and with the timer I can make a game of the work and try to beat my own time. What I would really, really love is to link my personal cleaning list with other family members so they can mark theirs off when completed. We could even make a game of that!",
            "Best customizable app for cleaning that I've come across!! I like to be able to plan chores during my weekdays to keep my weekends free and divide it equally so it doesn't feel overwhelming. I searched through many many apps and none were able to offer what I needed. I absolutely LOVE this app and has taken stress off me being able to feel more organized and keep a clean home. Thank you so very much :)",
            "I've been using this daily for months now, it's exactly what I wanted. I had no real schedule for chores before, just did things when it seemed like they needed doing, and always forgot when exactly I last did something. Now I'm on top of everything, be it daily chores or those that only need doing every few months. It really makes my life easier and my house nicer.",
            "I absolutely love this app. The only thing I wish it would do is filter by over due days. I'd like to be able to see what is most over due first to tackle what is most needed first."

Its fun but yet educational and you don't even realize how much knowledge you obtain from the short everyday challenges. It has helped me in many ways already! Highly recommend to use daily or at least 3-4 times a week upon downloading. Enjoy!!",

The only way i can do it is to eliminate the ones i can see first and hopefully they will be the last ones. I turned on colour blind mode but I don't know if it worked. It wasnt black and white. Some of the colours were invisible to me.",

I have been telling people (for years) that playing brain games can help stave off (their own or a loved one's) Alzheimer's and dementia. Now that I'm pushing 50 I'm taking my own advice-this app is perfect for it! Not only are the games fun, you can work targeted areas, track your progress, and see what percentile you are in.🤘",

            "The app is great. However, as a student it's basically a deal breaker that you can't have a start date for weekly tasks. I need to finish that homework by every Tuesday, not exactly on the due date. Also would be great to be able to create subtasks (yes, projects kinda work like this, but they're not enough). Still, I'm going to give this app a chance and keep using it, love most of it. The developer is active and quickly replies to emails, so hoping for some nice updates in the future :)",
            "Been using this app since 2014. There are plenty things I like about this app, nice UI, sync, works across devices, etc. My only problem with the app is when I complete a task after the due date. The App uses the due date as the completed date and not the actual date of completion. It's annoying as it doesn't reflect the reality of the task. Reported this issue in Aug 2019. Hopefully this issue gets fixed sooner otherwise this app deserves 5stars.",
            "I've tried Todoist before coming across Chaos Control and the difference is monumental. This app is far more elegant and less bloated and I love how simple and intuitive everything is! I will update this review to five stars as soon as routines are added, because that's the only thing that I feel is missing, otherwise the devs have done a fantastic job.",
            "*Update 10-14-20 Fantastic app to help organize your life! The best I've used personally. Chaos Control creators took the extra time and worked with me to get the app functioning well on my phone. Thanks so much for the positive help.",
            "This is one of the better attempts at a GTD app. Perhaps the best asset is folders in the projects list. I find input is too laborious on the phone and a little too much going on in terms of the views. The desktop app is clunky to navigate and has to much going on for a list manager in the approach to viewing it. It actually looks like a large mobile device too. Ok but didn't suit my needs (Free version)"

            "I really really like this app, DBT saved my life -- I still have much to improve upon. Practicing DBT on a daily basis has helped me to regain control of my emotions and allows me to stay focused and determined. DBT Coach is outstanding as a stand alone app, but for me personally it provides an effective substitution for a therapist during this transtion until I am able to afford individual sessions again.",
            "For $11.99 a month the app keeps crashing when certain lessons are opened. So you're paying for an app the only some content works. It's a shame because if it worked properly it would be worth it.",
            "The app is WAY overpriced. I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills. So I have used this app for two weeks and now cannot access/use the data accurately for my appointment tomorrow. If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",
            "I see potential. Needs better design and pricing. Will continue to use it to see how far I can go with free version. Also, needs someone to refresh the writing for a general audience. The video tour doesn't seem to work on my phone. Design is not intuitive. I had to figure it out by clicking around.",
            "Like the app, but it doesn't save your entry more times than not. Very frustrating."

            "its a great game and has a lot to do but it freezes a lot and it glitches too, sometimes when i go into the game and swipe to pick a game, it goes into the game that my finger first touches. the games are great but i don't really like how the \"fortune cookie add\" keeps popping up. but other than that it is honestly a great game.i don't know about other people but this is just my opionion if anyone thinks otherwise, they do",
            "I would rate it 5 stars but it has a couple of problems like the slimes are really unrealistic and ther loads of ads . Aso you have watch a ad to open a fortune cookie which really anyouing . This app is met to relieve stress but that is not!!!! Part from that really good app would I recommend it yes.",
            "I would definitely rate it 5 stars if it doesn't freeze .Many times despite of selecting a game , it freezes so much that game didn't open . Please fix this problem. Otherwise very nice app.Please bring back old version. I love this app so much.",
            "Amazing game. It has great graphics and is very helpful to reduce stress. I would definitely recommend it. I have tried many stress relief games and they all sucked. This one is actually worth downloading. #1 stress relief out there in my opinion.",
            "I love this app beacause when you are feeling stressed or anxious you can go on this app and calm down also the soap cutting is a bit glithchy but this app I would rate it (5 star)review so if you have anxioity download this app it will help!😜"

            "I'm really enjoying this app and feel like it's been worth the $5.50 to upgrade to the full version. I use it to document a variety of things. Ive been overwhelmed by writing and journaling in the past and the simplicity of this app has really encouraged me to write more. I'd really like to see the addition of a simple time line feature where I could map out a time line like you'd see in a history book. Would also like to be able to use the split screen option that my Samsung tablet facilitates.",
            "What is there is beautiful, responsive and, best of all, easy. It needs more. For me, for this app to be truly fully-featured, it needs a way to \"relate\" two bubbles from different orbits. Really, that's the only thing truly missing. You could add more with checklists/timers, but that may detract from the simplicity.",
            "I have been using for a couple years now and have been a paid user all year, and I love it. There are a few things I would also love to see in the near future. Also, I have lost supposed backed up files before, but since then no issues. Still a highly recommended app for Mind Mapping.",
            "Please add dark theme. I like to add lot of text in description, but scrolling text is hard \"inside\" that circles. It would be nice if you add a few little tools to edit description text like bold type or selection with color. When i work with mindmap, i can change parts of it in different time, so it would be better if i can see a date when i changed every \"circle\". Thanks for da precious app. Upd: uncomfortable writing, especially editing",
            "Love it a lot but... i wish there was a Microsoft app or a windows app for this! I don't use my phone much for typing because i have tremors so typing on it is difficult and takes time... i refuse to use anything apple related and just really want to be able to use this on my computer because itd be so much easier for me to write and type things out on it. Please make a program/app for windows computers! Im begging 🙇🏻‍♂️"

            "I love the idea, but it feels unpolished. It regularly freezes, and has weird bugs. My child's morning routine is set by end time, but this morning it arbitrarily set the end time 5 minutes earlier. One day I logged on and a robotic voice said I had to read for 11 hours. There should also be a \"home\" or \"finish\" button at the end of a routine. Right now the routine end feels unresponsive and confusing. The price is too high for something that feels like a beta & I'd prefer a one time purchase.",
            "I'm an adult using this for her inner child, and it's great. I wish the app had an option for putting a task off of the routine, like if I'm late for work and can't do a few of the tasks or if I already did them earlier before I remembered to start the timer. That way it wouldn't compromise the integrity of the time tracking to just swipe left. Also, the voice informing you to spend more time on the task is incredibly annoying. But overall this is the best app for ADHD people I've ever seen.",
            "Some features are fantastic, but after using it for a few days, I went into my settings and it is showing this is only a free trial (which it does not say anywhere in the description or when you sign up.) I started using this app upon the recommendation of a friend; we both have kids with ADHD and my kid seems to love it so far! (Age 7) but she will be disappointed when the free trial runs out and we can't use it anymore. 😔 I would not have tried it if I was aware of that fact.",
            "The application is very good! Its amazing to find out, how simple things like this app helped me to stay on track.. It makes me even happier, to find out that the developer is working on the new version of the app, targeting adults. Brilli team, I thank you for your great job.",
            "I've been using this as an adult with ADHD and its been really helpful! Very much looking forward to an adults version in the future"

            "This isn't a complete app for average people, I don't think more than 80% of people who have downloaded this would understand this app. 1. The instructions are only partial and doesn't indicate that the text will be of 15 minutes, You would have to read \"About app\" for that. 2. What the hell those figures even mean? No matter if the figures are accurate or not they do not even remark about ones performance in the test which feels like you have wasted all your time. Can be made a lot better.",
            "Tap the screen except when you see the letter \"?\"... The next button covers the letter im supposed to be looking for so I cant read the full instructions. Very frustrating.",
            "Silly app, it's meant to be testing you on your ability to react to a letter but the actual letter is hidden under UI so you don't know what it is. Basic error really.",
            "Good Start! Nice Test with option to control sound and vibration Can you please add the following: 1. Option for test duration say 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, etc 2. Option for speed or interval between two letters 3. Can the reports be only in English. One worksheet can give explanation which will help the users to choose the right metric. Also user info not avbl in attachment is it because I clicked on Test. You may like to see the SART app on i-phone All the best",
            "Interesting, but could be better if the app gave some indication of what the results meant. It's dissapointing to have done the test for what felt like no reason. It's hard to tell how your performance is in relation to other people's. The test could say things like if you're average, above average or below average. Or it could give some indication of the chances of you having ADHD (I myself am being tested tomorrow)."

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

Sharing a pdf via email didn't work (no PDF attached to email!).  Worse yet, Google Play denied a refund of the $3.49 purchase price, despite my  requesting the refund within less than an hour of purchase. I uninstalled the app, re-downloaded, and now all I have access to is the free version; I can't even use the limited functionality I paid for in the first place!  I've written to the developer to request a direct refund, and will update this review with their response."

            "I 100% recommend this planner. It is so helpful in my everyday life instead of piling everything into my Memo's where it doesn't have daily separations. If you're thinking of getting a planner app, this one is great, but I do have a recommendation for the creator(s) to add. [Unless it's in premium, I don't have it.] I think we should have an \"edit\" option on things, incase we misspell something like that!",
            "Very good, thanks 🤗😁👍, appreciate the stability of the App and how it runs so smooth! This App has such intuitiveness and keeps me on-the-move with organizing my tasks. The card-type interface is really cool 👍, I especially like the dark theme. I bought it 🧡💛❤️... Love how the numbers above the date number on the calendar page resemble a traffic light for task completion...! red-yellow-green, clever!",
            "Re-reviewing because my last one was negative, but that was my own fault! 🤦‍♀️ I couldn't figure out how to rearrange tasks and thought it wasn't an option, but the developer very kindly got back to me and let me know how it was done. So with that in mind, five stars! I can't think of a thing that would make this app better. (Premium is also totally worth it, by the way!)",
            "I just started using this app about two hours ago and I am overwhelmingly thrilled. It is easy to use, very user friendly, it offers all the functions we need for daily self- organisation in a simple way. It is excellent. This app makes the calender, a notepad and many more Android apps useless😉. Thanks",
            "I have ADD, therefore, staying on task is a problem for me. With this app, not only can I create a list of things that need to be done, but I can create sub-lists which is almost always a necesssity for me. Definitely a 5 star rating!"

            "I like the apo because as I was listening to the ADHD therapy one I started to remember something I forgot to do (it isnt good when that happens to me, u get worried an anxious ) and the sounds distracted that thought to where I couldn't concentrate on it. It helped because if not it might have led to an anxiety attack and/or mental breakdown.",
            "Love all of them, especially the anxiety one but I wish it didn't have those few spots where the sound breaks, and mine won't loop so it should have a timer so you can do longer than 10 minutes.",
            "i get really bad tic attacks because of anxiety and the anxiety one doesnt work but the adhd one helps so much thank you",
            "I love it, I use the anxiety track and it actually does make me feel more calm most the time. Only thing that would be nice was if you could have the option for a timer. For example if I wanna play a track on repeat as I try to fall asleep but I don't want it still playing after I fall asleep. So if I could set it to stop playing after an hour or so. That would be great.",
            "I have severe anxiety and a lot of things set me off. One thing I get extremely anxious about is the world ending so hearing rain doesn't calm me at all. It only gives me an anxiety attack. Instead I use the pain reliever music for my anxiety"

You can express yourself as you are.\r\nArt is a visual language that transforms the unconscious into consciousness, so the inner mind can be naturally expressed. You can express yourself freely regardless of your language ability. It helps you reduce fear or defensiveness.\r\n\r\nB. Anyone can have fun with it.\r\nAnyone can do it easily, regardless of their artistic talent or age. Infants and toddlers who can't speak well, children with disabilities, and seniors with dementia, they can all do it. You can feel joy and happiness through the creative activity of art.\r\n\r\nC. Art therapy can purify your troubling and painful emotions.\r\nYou can feel the emotional purification (catharsis) that you get from expressing your inner emotions to others in an art form.\r\n\r\nD. You can see the process of change by looking at the artworks that come out of the process of art therapy.\r\nArtworks have specific results that can be preserved over time.

One request is to have a persistent notification while the timer is running so the user can quickly check the time left if on another app. Love that you can keep the screen awake!",
            "The UI is trying a bit too hard to be simple and it manages to do the opposite. And yes, the price is a bit high. But it works, it's consistent, and has helped me with my problems of knowing that time is passing. If you have ADHD or any other condition with a similar time impairment, I recommend it.",
            "It's a nice feature. I hope they can add pomodoro function too with asking if we want go proceed to the next session which can be great for project or simply doing a routine with a smooth transition between tasks with necessary breaks as some of us may forget to take a break. Add more variety of colors too! Also adding a widget would be nice and/or having a visual timer on the notification beside the text when away from the app.",
            "Hi, I am a huge Time timer suporter and I use it regularly.  I started using it in my Ipad, Iphone and then I bought a TimeTimer wrist watch too.  I have have always wanted time timer on a smart watch and now I see you have finally released it on apple watch. Unfortunately I switched from apple to Samsung last year and now I have a Samsung Galaxy watch. I do hope that Time Timer is planning to release a galaxy watch app soon too and would like to know when it will be available.   Thank You."

            "The app has a lot of potential, but you can not move to the next task until the timer runs out. If you finish early, you just have to wait for the timer to run out. I would also like to be able to start at each seperate activity, rather than having to start at the beginning of the schedule each time. Currently, if you forget to start it at the first activity, you can't skip ahead to the second one. Uninstalled, even though it is a cute app and works well. It doesn't work for us."

        "description": "Productivity Challenge Timer is a Pomodoro timer which aims to help you be more productive, more focused, waste less time and so on, you already know all that stuff.\r\n\r\nWhat this app is about is challenging you to work and study harder and tracking your work habits. You'll earn/lose ranks depending on your performance, earn achievements and track your productivity over time, so you'll know how long you worked on what and during which days of the week and hours of the day you're at your most productive.\r\n\r\nNow here's a few things you should know before downloading:\r\n\r\n- This is not an organizer. If you can't keep track of what you're supposed to be doing, this app is not for you. The app includes tracking of projects so you know how much time you spent working on each of your clients/books/websites/whatever - like a time sheet, but it's not meant to be an organizer or a to-do list.\r\n\r\n- This app is in English only. No translations are planned for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n- This app will not let you pause work sessions or finish them early, so if you have a tiny baby-sized bladder and you need to pause every few minutes, this app is not for you. The shortest work session you can set is 10 minutes and you're not supposed to be interrupted. Also because I use this app too, and I'd be the first to abuse that pause feature to go look up useless nonsense instead of getting work done.\r\n\r\n- The purpose of this app is not to promote a healthy work-life balance, but to get you to work harder. Because of this, it does not recognize weekends or holidays or parenting or any other excuse to take time off, and it will demote you if you start slipping. Please don't expect the app to validate your goals, its sole purpose is to make you work harder, even when you shouldn't.\r\n\r\n- If you want to use the app with the screen off, make sure it's been exempted from any battery saving apps/features your device may be using.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it, thanks for reading and I hope you find this app as useful as I do.",

            "Just for betterment, here are the key point to the developer: Please add more *ticking* sound, as the only sound available in it sometimes too speedy for any work of focus. Add some real clock sound , 1 tick per second. As of now, 2 tick per second available in the app.",
            "For some reason, adding the game element to a productivity tracker really helps me stay more engaged. The app is also attractively designed and feels well made, and I appreciate the sense of humor that pops up throughout.",
            "A very good app, keeps you on your toes. Perhaps the developer may include the possibility of day(s) of rest without losing ones ranking. It's human and refreshing to rest a little from all work/goals once or twice a week without dropping off the ranks.",
            "A very good work by the developer. The way he has written the ABOUT section is really funny. The best thing about this app is the achievements one recieves as one progresses.",
            "This one is actually helpful because of the rank system: much of my obligatory uni work feels like a waste of time, so at least i get something out of doing it. Using this app ive gone from maybe 30 mins to 2-3h a day of work."

            "Mostly not too special, but there are a few good games that I haven't seen in similar relaxation apps. \"Galaxy\" is one. As for \"common\" anti-stress games, this app has the best slime simulator! (The mud/clay is my favorite.)",
            "Ok I just installed it, not so bad. I actually really enjoy some of these cute games, but I did not try them all yet. I tried the stretch one, and I was not so impressed with that one, I expected I could really stretch it not just move the hands. The butter one, was not actual butter, it was just bubbles you press on. Sometimes the game is not responding to my touches. If you add more games and fix these mistakes in your game, it will be a lot better. :)",
            "This is supposed to be a game that relieves stress. Not increase it. I feel like I can't ever relax with this game without having to be shown an ad. People look these kind of games to calm down, not to be hounded with ads. Please fix this, and I'll be more than happy to give you five stars.",
            "This makes me rage more because of all the fricking ads, I would rate it 4 stars if it hadn't had so many ads."

            "Please stop fixing things that aren't broken. I have had this app for years. And it has been perfect. Now with the new update I have a stupid constant alert that no alarm/whatever alarm is set. I can't turn it off. And when the alarm goes off I have to unlock my lock screen before I can shut it off, even though the settings are set to not do that. So now it is waking my partner up too, because it takes so long to turn off.",
            "Just updated after the old app failed twice this week...I loved that app, I didn't want to say goodbye...but I don't want to get sacked for being late either so...This version looks nice so far; doesn't seem to be missing any important features from the old one, so that's good. Interface is a little loud, black and grey was better for morning eyes. Playlist manager is improved. The fact my paid version carried over is appreciated. I'll add the extra star if it proves itself a worthy successor.",
            "Every update, you guys still manage to break this app even further. It was perfect a couple of updates ago. In one update, you added an annoying notification. In the last update, you added loud ads after turning off the alarm, which made the awake test malfunction. Please make sensible updates. I understand you need to have ads but don't make them show up when we are half awake in the morning.",
            "Giving it 3 stars because the alarm will not stop blowing up your eardrums even if you're doing the tasks, until you finished them. With other similar apps I could run over to the other side of the house in silence. With this I'm afraid of waking up everybody else and need to do the tasks while trying to hold my finger over the loudspeaker. Please fix this and will give 5 stars",
            "I always use a playlist and have it randomly play to help me wake up and I don't know what happened but it started just playing my ringtone for every single alarm. I have tried everything I can think of to fix it and it wouldn't even recognize I had a playlist and then when it did, it keeps telling me it's empty when it's not."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",

            "My daughter has a learning disability and has no concept of time, this app helps her understand how long to wait until something is over or begins. We use it for calming time and also for when we are waiting to do an activity that we are really excited about. When we use the app it helps to remove the anticipatory anxiety & the constant questioning about when we are going to do that activity. Helps her understand concept of time, something the Dr is still convinced she won't be able to do.",
            "Very nice. I use this a lot with my 2 year old, she loves seeing if she can beat the timer. My only request would be for the image to stay up on the screen at the end of the timer until a button is pressed, because every so often she misses the ending. But the timer is a great way to get kids to understand time and to implement predictability for our kids, i.e. when we need to leave - I can tell her she has 5 or 10 more minutes to play and when the timer ends, we go home.",
            "This app is really good however there is too many ads and considering the target audience, children and children with disabilities, it really should be ad free.",
            "Love how I can set this and it ticks down the time. I love how the theme changed everytime I use it. Works great for getting my kids to do something in a certain about of time.",

        "comments": [
            "I really like this app. One suggestion, please add a reward kind of thing in the sparkle section. Like, if I completed a sparkle I should be able to check it (this option is already there) and then I should be allowed to do a thing I like as reward. For example if I just finished composing a music piece, I should be able to get a reward for it (like eating my fav ice cream or something), so that people get an inspiration to work. Thank you",
            "The app says it's for self care but tbh it can be used to track any activity you'd like. It even lets you make notes about your progress. The only reason I have not rated it a full 5 is because I was expecting to see my progress for individual tasks, like for eg, I'd like to see in the calender only the days I exercised. But it shows all the tasks clubbed in one single calender so you have to go to different dates to see if you did a particular activity.",
            "I thought this was kind of too simple of an idea. Why do I need an app for this? But a friend loves it, so I have it a try. And I have to say, I'm so impressed. It has made me realize patterns in my life that lead to more contentment and peace. It has alsoade me realize that things I thought really filled me up actually don't. Other, simpler things, are really what I need. I'm so happy I found this app.",
            "Loving this app so far! It's very minimalistic and it works really well. It can also be used for other things to track aside from self-care. Just bought Sparkle Plus and it's definitely worth it (and really cheap too)!",
            "Clean, simple, user friendly interface, free version worked so well I paid for the usefulness of tracking more sparkles... well done app, thank you."

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

I would love it if there was a 20 or 30minute timer option also in another colour! I know you can adjust the 1 hour timer but its something about having the full circle count down that makes it easier to get my head around when managing tasks.",
            "I was hoping this would have some sort of reminder sound at certain intervals, like another app which unfortunately didn't work for me to do some bug making it unreliable, unfortunately it just seems like the clock that comes with my phone, except with ads.",
            "at the end the timer keeps making a sound, even if I set it to not notify. this is very disturbing when recording a video!!! graphically the app is good.",
            "Great app for little kiddos that don't know how to tell time yet. My son used to throw fits during timeout, but now that he sees that he's not going to be there all day long, he sits a lot better.",
            "A great visual for elementary through high school students. Works very well for both general and special education. Excellent for community based instruction"

            "This is a fantastic visual timer for kids, kitchen, projects, ADHD, ASD, study, meetings and Pomodoro. Resizes perfectly. Keeps tracking even if it's not on top. Customizable settings to not sleep, change alarm sounds and alarm options. Countdown out loud at whatever interval you set or turn that off. Create preset timers and use the widget to create desktop shortcuts. Simple. Easy. Fast. Reliable. Kid friendly. To adjust the time, you just click and drag or drag it with your finger.",
            "Does exactly what it says on the tin. The alarm feature isn't very alerting but still if you are tentative to when the timer is roughly going to expire then the alarm outputs should suffice!",
            "I use this daily at work to time my breaks. Would like to be able to add a customisable reminder that pops up when timer is done.",
            "This app has honestly improved so much since I last bought it in 2018. Good job to the dev and more power!!",
            "It's not too bad, but it would benefit from some more features and customizations, like having the ability to have certain timers start at certain times. You can string together timers which is nice (have one automatically start after another) if you want to plan a specific daily routine or something like that. Calendar integration, like scheduling certain timers, would be nice. Overall it is a pretty good app but leaves a lot to be desired, maybe just for what I am trying to accomplish with it"

            "I tried other apps with similar function. But this one is simple, with enough features. Suitable for study or focus on your tasks and see how much time you've spent on each task weekly or in a month. However it has a bug. I find out that parts of my hours have not been saved, but I don't know why! Specially the hours that occurred at the midnight (12a.m)",
            "Really good, covers all of the functions I need without being overly complicated. There's one weird behavior that I don't like though: having to tap next after one block finishes, and then tapping it again to start. I want to auto-start next block. A 3 second countdown timer that you can tap to pause auto-start. Sometimes (a lot of times) I forget to tap next to start the timer... Would also appreciate if the reset button only appears after you pause! And option to change theme colors :)",
            "It's very simplistic, and that's what I love most about the app. It allows you to see how you're working and give you a visual idea of how much time you've put into something. And you can have different categories of activities. It doesn't give you data and dat of stats, just a simple graph to show you how much time, and a decent timer. Recommended.",
            "I installed because of the interactive graph. But the app has many many bugs. 1. If I start the timer at a time, pause it in middle and resume it, and end it some other time, it showing that I completed the task continuously without break, from the starting time. 2. If I minimise and come back, the timer restarts from the beginning.",
            "The app requires me to manually start focus and rest sessions, despite already having set the schedule. This means that I constantly need to fiddle with my phone during work time. I wish there was an option to have the app automatically start and end sessions until I intervene, so that I could just follow the notifications."

            "I love this app. It is the best one I have found, so far, which is really free. Other apps make this claim, but then block access to certain material unless a payment is made. As a fairly novice meditation practitioner, I found this app invaluable because there is a beginner's course and intermediate course. Following on from these courses there are a variety of packs for different situations. From daily meditations to managing stress or anxiety, for better sleep, for walking, e.t.c.",
            "Wow, this app is 100% quality. There is content for every situation and it is free. For those of you who are tired by commercialization of meditation apps - this is an app for you. I like that there is a simple customizable timer. Although I don't understand what offline / online mode means in the context of it. Seems like the meditation track is streamed anyway. Developers, could you clarify what that feature does?",
            "Hands down the best app I've ever had for meditation. I've used so many other apps but this one is the only app I've actually stuck to using. The interface is so seamless and so easy to use. And it's 100 percent free. No sneaky purchases or special meditation packs. That sort of transparency is much appreciated and I honestly wouldn't mind donating or paying. I don't know how to support you guys other than this, if there is literally any other way to help, let me know!",
            "After trying several meditation apps (Simple Habit, Headspace, Atom, etc), I like Medito the most because it's simple, user-friendly, and beginner-friendly. All sessions are free and the selection is well curated, which I love because what frustrated me with other apps is that too many options can be overwhelming and having series wherein some episodes are free while others are paid can stunt one's growth. Their \"Getting Started\" collection is useful particularly for a newbie like me, as many of the other apps do not offer in-depth tutorials on what to expect and how to practice correctly. As a cherry on top, I like the options for background sound, especially Spring Field. The audio is balanced well with the voice, so it's not too loud nor soft, and it plays seamlessly. It seems like a small thing, but it's something that had bugged me and turned me off from other apps. If I had to nitpick - it would be wonderful if you can expand your collections under Sleep Meditation and Mantra Affirmations as they currently only have a handful each.",
            "This is my first meditation app and I find it very well made. You can pick what kind of meditation you need as the sessions are divided into sections. The voices are very calming. I've been meditating for about 4 months now and I can see some improvement in managing my stress and being a nicer person in general. Thank you guys and keep up your work!"

            "I love this app, it helps to guide you and gives you ideas and things to think about Update: 10/12/2020 I loved this app at the beginning. Then the question of the day stopped changing. It has been stuck on my 3 personal qualities. I stopped using the app for a while and recently got back into it and it is still asking that same question. It is irritating to me.",
            "I like it but there's a couple of bugs with the app. When I'm typing my journal entry, I scroll back up or down to fix a typo and it will take me to the next step (listing victories of the day). One time it did that and it erased everything that I typed. when I select a logged mood/activity, it pulls up the screen for the day. It will say \"no logs.\" I can only view the moods by viewing by week, or viewing a day after the actual day of the mood. For example, a mood on Aug 31 will show on Sept 1",
            "Love this so far, it very much helps to track your mood. Also it makes you think several times about the worst things in your life so that you can make sure they have some positive impact, even the smallest bit. I will be working with this app for more and I hope after some time I would be able to notice some changes in myself!",
            "So far so good. I will review after I've used it longer. Only 2 days so far but I very much like the way it is laid out - one has to stop and really think about one's self and why one feels, thinks, reacts or emotes in certain ways. I would like to know how to go back and look at my past stories. So frustrating!!!",
            "This app is incredible I love the feeling of opening this app and expressing my feeling and how my day went its like you have someone to talk to its amazing I would really recommend this app, I use this every day and wouldnt turn to a different journaling experience."

Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",

            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",

The only app using bluetooth to listen through earbuds. Impossible to use for the intended purpose. Update: seems only to fail on the Study program. ADHD ran the entire preprogrammed time without stopping.",

HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",
            "For those of you dealing with the app getting killed in the background regardless of your battery optimization settings...try Mindroid. This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",

            "I love this app, I paid for the premium and it's totally worth it. I love all the suggestions it has for time frames to help me be cleaner, and the custom chores I can create. I use it everyday to help keep me on track for all the little and big tasks I have to do to try and keep a neat house! Now I just need my husband to do his assigned tasks (he has the app too). I wish you could move forward tasks that are due today though, at least for a little bit while I focus on other ones.",
            "The bones are there, and they work--this app changed everything around for my partner and me. Amazing help emptying my brain of all the to-do overload & made it easy to catch up and stay on track. I wonder if it's built by someone with executive functioning disorder (like me). It certainly works as a valuable tool. Well worth the cost for premium, and that's coming from someone who has bought a grand total of three apps in as many years.",
            "I love this app. Once you take the time to properly set it up it takes most of the thinking and prioritizing out of cleaning. Freeing up mind space and making it easier for me to get things done. I can adjust the difficulty and importance or frequency of the tasks anytime. The only draw back (why I didnt give it 5 stars), every new user must buy in to sync your household. They should just have a household price or pkg for different sizes so that not every person has to pay a fee to use it.",
            "Deleted all of my data. We liked it so much we paid for premium. I just got a new phone, transferred everything over and when I open the app everything is completely gone. Best believe my payment information is still on file though. Very disappointed. Edit: I was able to reactivate it by pairing with my husband's phone. Changed my review score.",
            "Pretty great app. Feature request: When editing the interval of a task, could you please implement the possibility to see what the default intervals for the different attitudes would be? So I can basically not set different attitudes for different tasks. I would like to do that because some tasks can wait longer than others."

Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",

Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",

I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "I really like this app. There are a wide variety of available sessions and i enjoy being able to put in my emotions and have a list of tailored sessions. I have two recommendations: the first is to be able to search for sessions by name or topic, and the second is to have the option put in the goal of the session instead of/in addition to your emotions, to help the list of sessions be even more tailored to you. I also wish the voices were a bit more soothing (slower/calmer/quieter/gentler)",
            "I love using the meditation timer on this app. It has guided meditation as well as timed with different sounds, like the forest, rain and desert, etc. You can also choose the length of time of mediation and if you would other sounds. Some features unlock with more use or if you buy the subscription. This is a great app! Update: I still use this app everyday! It is amazing!",
            "Works wonders for my anxiety! The body scan practice actually stopped me from having a panic attack last year. I have a difficult time with sounds, but I love Jamie's calming voice. Thank you for creating such a wonderful outlet that allows me to calm down and breathe when I forget to. I highly recommend this app to my mental health group as well!♡",
            "Deceptively simple app, it seems like theres almost nothing to it at first. But what it does have, actually works. The breathing timer is my go to, especially during these stressful times. Every now and then I'll go with one of the guided meditations too, they're pretty cool. There's an explanation in the settings about how meditation actually helps that doesnt sound like total spiritual nonsense, so that was pretty cool. My only complain is that the art style.",
            "Love this app. I'm a mental health provider and I work with young people. This is a great way to introduce mindfulness. I'm also so excited that you added a Progress Muscle Relaxation exercise (Squeeze and Let Go)! I've looked high and low for a good one, never found one until this!"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "Before I started using Waking Up, I had a half-hearted meditation practice with a self-timer, which was mostly just me being lost in thought for 10-20 minutes. I was a bit elitist about this practice as well, thinking that 'true mindfulness' is not compatible with listening to someone speak. Waking Up has not only improved my meditation practice, by showing me what it actually means to be mindful, but has also changed my daily experience and made me aware of many of my thought processes.",
            "I liked it in its infancy, but the more it develops there really is a great deal to treasure here. Lots of variety. The learning included, by way of lessons and conversations, is great to reinforce practice, and it's additionally marvelous that a number of those participating in Sam's podcast conversations have contributed meditation programs for the app. Liked it in its infancy, but have come to love it. A new program added this week... On the up and up!",
            "I just took the first session and I am already glad that I started using this. Maybe its the way Sam speaks in the calm soothing voice of his, but I already feel a bit relaxed, and for some reason I feel connected to him, like maybe he knows me... Haha.. Don't know if that makes sense... I'm looking forward to learning more about my mind. :)",
            "I really like the content of this app but I would have expected a paid app of this price to be better programmed. For example, it doesn't auto pause if you also have Google maps directions on the go, so Google maps speaks over it. This makes it difficult to listen to any of the podcasts or discussions whilst driving which is what I wanted to do. Could you fix this please?",
            "I just love this app. It's the best introduction to meditation out there and takes you through the stages of meditation and mindfulness in a scientific manner. Sam harris has also included talks and sessions with many other thinkers in the area so you can explore the kind of philosophy that works best for you, that keeps you keeping on with this practise. They keep adding new methods and information and features so it's worth the subscription fee. Go for it."

My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",

            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

I don't know how they made it,but it helped me really improve.even though I'm already a pretty steady and organized person,this actually makes me feel good about me,my day,but the only 3 cons I really have to yell out is, 1. Sometimes after I finish a task,it plays it over again,thus gets in my way,so bare this in mind. 2. It takes long to load sometimes which wastes time. 3.you can't add another kid,and it will say already joined if you sign in a different device.",

If SEARCH is added that should have direct search in Role, Gole and Action directly from Screen. otherwise also it is best app. it is good it is free. many thanks. Will give five stars once SEARCH feature is added. Please make this available on Windows 10 MS Store too.",
            "This app is by far the most used on my phone. It helps me so much to plan my day and weeks with the easy to follow format. My only hope is they will also add a checklist feature so that my boxes don't get so full with small tasks that are all related.",
            "By far one of the best productivity apps I've used. And I could tell you, I've been through a quite a few. This one keeps me motivated and helps me finish tasks in time, leaving me extra time for myself. Where before I was lucky if I could catch a break.",

            "It's simple and cool. Autoprompting is my fav part Dev: Is there a way to customize the things that are surveyed? I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

            "*Update: Wow!! Only 4€ for a full subscription!! Thank you guys!! the new features are also great!!! *I don't know yet how affordable is this app, i fear i won't be able to purchase it after they reintroduce the paying plans. But i am really thankful for this free period, i feel it helps and i really needed a good tool to help me regain balance at this strange, unpredictable time. Thank you! Great and beautiful app! 🙏",
            "I initially installed it because of the aesthetic appeal. Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced. I try to fill the three clouds when I remember, but I'm not yet regular with it. The Thought Diary function was immensely helpful in a difficult situation. Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",
            "The app is great. If you pay for the non free parts it would be a better experience. I'm currently using the free section but helps as have to think and find the positive in the day and why do I think its happend. It helps to re read when going through a rough day and realising that you have more good days if you find the good.",
            "I like it so far. Would be usefull to have it on other languages. Really like the rabbit on app icon, It may sound crazy 😄 but every day I remind my self to speak with rabbit, share my thoughts with him and try to stay positive. It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking. Meditations are ok.",
            "It has a cute visual design and is very simple to use, only I do wish there were some more features other than writing down notes. Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them.

            "I love it :D I met great and fun people and this is the only to-do apps that really makes me do it or else I'll die oof. I love the concept and all but i kinda wish that there'll be more default costumes like the hair that is free, or some that can be bought by coins if possible. And maybe the background too? Anyways overall I love it, it was really effective for me. Keep up the good work, I'll look forward on it",
            "I was very excited to try this but the app is a joke. There's no proper user flow or error handling- after registering I got no confirmation, I had to quit and open the app again so it would let me login. I added goals but they were in no way saved after reinstalling for troubleshooting. I can't check them as completed. No tutorial, no character loads like in the screenshots. It's not a network problem either, it's just a broken app",
            "Dear Habitica, This app is currently impossible for me to use. There is no save OR delete button for editing habits. I checked your most recent reviews and a few others seem to have the same problem. Please, please, please fix this. I will say as well that the first opening of the game feels a little jarring. The editing of ones character feels clumsy and it is definitely not better to start with a randomized character. Give users a blank sheet and let THEM apply changes.",
            "Awful. Installed on Galaxy Note 10 Lite. Avatar, gold and gems images dont show up. It is not synced with my desktop account at all. It says i have no tasks, when I've actually got about 50. The app does literally nothing at all on my phone. Same on my partners Note 10 Lite. Tried logging in with Username, google and facebook. Deleted cache and data. Reinstalled. The app is literally useless. Ive messaged the devs, yet to hear back. The browser game is amazing. I just wish it worked on my phone.",
            "I love the layout, structure and simplicity of this app. But it has one critical failure There is no way to view stats except how many times you have done a thing. \"Make the bed\" 23 times. In what timeframe? A month? A year? What is the percentage of days it has been made/not made? The only thing I feel like I have to show for this is virtual items. If you would add satisfaction with good stats I would rate 5/5! Kindest regards William"

            "Great app. Straight forward and the narrator has an incredibly soothing voice. So much to gain from this app and their other app NeuroNation I think it's called? That one is fab too!! :)",
            "This app is wonderful. There is a significant lack of pressure to adhere to a particular course or even to buy premium (making me personally feel far more willing to subscribe to be honest). This app feels like it genuinely created to support people rather than for financial gain - which is something you rarely see nowadays. All in all, this app places meditation in the hands of the user, but provides freedom within it's supportive direction. Useful both for the beginner and the experienced.",
            "Just did a 7 minutes breathing exercises and love it so far. It's short and simple and I definitely feel more relaxed after 7 minutes.",
            "Everything was working fine. Until yesterday when the sessions just stopped loading(only the hot air ballon appears). I have an A5 2017 and restarting the app/phone doesn't fix it.",
            "I have tried to meditate in the past but never quite been able to. I tried this app and for the first time really understood how peaceful meditation can be!"

            "A useful app, keeps the mind active, although I have two main observations: the first is that the training 'games' are in fact testing your knowledge in relation to 'speed'. All tasks are time sensitive, and you are encouraged to answer or respond to actions in as short as time as possible. I'm sorry, that is not necessarily going to improve an individuals grammar or math in any way. Secondly, there should be a way to choose your level, (or beginner to advanced)",
            "Love it! So good! Currently doing maths and English at college so this in my spare time or just whenever I fancy a little phone time is ideal! Unfortunately I don't wanna buy the full version yet! Quite pricey! But I'm sure i will at some point! Maybe if it had a little monthly subscription I'd be more up for it. But yea, for now I will enjoy the free version until I can splurge out. I'll keep an eye out for a price drop also",
            "I wouldn't necessarily say it is a brain training app, more of what you understand at a point of time. Due to the timer in the games, you never really take in the mistakes you make, so nothing gets retained. Also, some of the games are really boring, I lose interest half way through a lot of the times and I have to restart them.",
            "This is very sophisticated, very artful, beautiful to see, and fun. Good algorithm's for challenging you based on your progress - just enough to keep you egaged and learning without being discouraged. There is a large number of activities . VERY clever design of games. I \"train\" (play) daily. I have learned things that I have used elsewhere. I am 67 years old too.",
            "This is a really good app! I have to say it's never crashed my phone before and it uses very little battery. However recently I've had to change this review as my training streak had mysteriously disappeared even though I have done my session everyday. It was up to about 130 days so I am hoping you will put it back as I have emailed twice. You said you have replied to me via email however I have not received an email on the dates you have said to have said to have sent one."

I have installed another app which has an alarm⏰ option but the alarm does not sound😐. But it helped me a lot😘. Thank you so much for that🙏. I wish there were more apps like this. 😊❤️",
            "I like the simplicity but there is a major bug. A lot of the notifications won't ever arrive. Also a lot of them won't come until I open the app. So the app is kind of useless right now. I really hope they fix this bug, because the app is the first scheduling app that works for my life.",

That way if I forget to start it, I can still input it correctly. Otherwise this is a fantastic app, and I'm highly considering purchasing the premium version",
            "Great app! 5 stars if they would add a reset feature on the timers or, more ideally, allow you to select what time your timers reset each day. I stay up late so on some days I don't complete a task until after midnight which makes it count towards the next day. If I want to do that same task when I wake up, the timer is already completed and I have to make a duplicate of that task in order to time the task.",
            "I've been using the app for a short time now, but I gotta say is amazing. There's a thing I've been struggling for a while and is keeping certain taks under a certain amount of time, I get perfectionist and things start taking time from other things. This app has a wonderful approach to time management using time limitis as either goals or limits, which allows me to make sure I am dedicating to each task the time I do want to dedicate. I love it.",
            "Awesome and elegant interface. Easy to use, with history (calendae) to keep track of time. I have a suggestion though, can you please make me register my days missing? I have a streak in Duolingo of 150 days for example and just installed the app today. It would be great if I could check on the days missing. Other apps like Habits have this feature, and yeah, I would like to have all my favorite features in one app. Thank you!",
            "Simple, clean and effective! No ads is a HUGE win! I belong to a goal setting group and have introduced this app to the group - several members are excited to use it. Hoping for a \"to-do list\" feature in the future. Thank you for this app!"

Thank you very much. Cachal Teagues",
            "I've had this app for 10 years and this is a fun app when it comes to brain games. it does make you think and really makes you try to beat your timing when doing different games on here the only thing, I don't like is that you have to pay to do a different game if you want to do that differently daily or you have to wait daily for the games to change that's the only thing that sucks on here but all the games are fun. I love coffee game on here and I love the train game, super fun for the brain.",

            "Appears to be the only effective timeboxing app on the Play store. Not updated since 2015? Crazy. If you seriously intend to get a lot done across multiple projects, this app is utterly invaluable. If success in your field depends on being able to do that consistently, then stop right here: you've found the answer - a total game changer. Join the rest of us dedicated, but frustrated users. I'd pay £10 for an updated version of this app. Someone wake up the developer.",
            "Great app with some annoying inconveniences/bugs 1. Whenever a message pops up, it pops up directly over the control icons at the bottom and you have to wait a second for it to disappear if you want to tap on the icons. 2. I have continuous mode OFF and whenever I complete a task it starts the timer for the next one. 3. When you're adding the time duration for a task, it's sooo annoying to have to scroll through the numbers and it's not that responsive. Why not just manually type it in?",
            "Google Tasks integration is buggy or just badly designed. This app has written a JSON string to all of my task notes, except for the ones that already contained other notes. It goes without saying that it looks terrible on Google apps. I have sent a feedback email but received no response as of yet. Some other suggestions: Add task categories like Google Tasks have instead of throwing all of the tasks into one place. Add calendar support.",
            "My phone updated & now the alarms stopped working! Phone says app was made for older version of Android & might not work properly. Please, please, please update it for the newest version of Android! This app helps me so much & I can't find anything like it! It's almost useless without the alarms. Addition: I just uninstalled & reinstalled, thinking that since it syncs with Google it would restore my routines. But it didn't! There's no way to restore. I lost them all!",
            "I have updated my phone to android 10. After updating app displaying the message that , this is an older version. Update the app or contact to the developer. Also alarm and some other function is not working now. The app now is not compatible with android. Could you please update the app, which is compitable with android 10. Because I can't find the app like this. It would be really appreciable if you bring update. its a nice app. thanks to the team. I can manage the time very efficiently."

            "Almost perfect... I only wish it had more to do with the \"game\" aspect. It's basically a to-do list or planner. Sure, it gives you some \"gold\" and experience points based on your completed tasks, but they amount to nothing, as there is nothing to do with either once collected. No built-in items to purchase, no character creation or customisation... disappointing. That being said, the tasks are easy to create and customise. I feel more organised than usual. So, thanks, I guess.",
            "This app is very customizable, which I definitely wanted in an RPG style To Do list. However, it does come at a cost, since getting everything set up how you'd like takes much longer than similar apps. Personally I think the trade is worth it (hence my rating), but be aware that if you're looking for something more simple, this probably isnt the app for you. If you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work, pick this one over the others!",
            "Great, but it is missing a feature that honestly has me looking elsewhere. This app would be perfect for me, except that it seems that the app only provides a \"Successful executions\" graph for a given event with a time interval of _one_ week. I'm interested in the tracking of my successful executions of an event over a long period of time, and so not having an option for a graph over a longer timeline is a bit of a bummer.",
            "It really helps with getting things done! Receiving XP, gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do. I like that - on the contrary to other apps - it is actually useful without having to get the premium version. Though the premium version is a nice addition. Suggestion: some rewards could already be existent so you don't have to come up with them yourself. I personally don't have many ideas for coming up with rewards and don't know what gold price would be appropriate.",
            "It would be nice to have the ability to set an xp/coins decay until a particular task is completed. Also, would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time (rather than editing its time and resetting it, or duplicating it). Also, maybe add search ability for filtering icons (as there are so many)."

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

Second, the format provides low visibility. I was looking for something thst displays data like a calendar with icons and notes to show my doctors an overall picture of my health for each day. This is more like a database that has to be searched by individual criteria. I can't use this app in its current format.",

            "it seems okay on the surface, and the questions are pretty basic the only problem I see is the phrasing on the page before you start answering questions. it describes autism as a scale. the issue with this is that it makes autism seem more like a step ladder (as if someone can be \"a bit autistic\" or \"very autistic\") when really, the whole \"high/low functioning\" idea only describes how much people mask, which is incredibly harmful to their mental health.",
            "Why can't you put \"?\" for don't understand or it opens up and you can check the check box and or other: write what you mean but allow lots of room, also in the left corner you can push give feedback. And remember you need to make it word like it's for a small child that needs to understand, because that's my comprehension level 🤔.",
            "Am aware that an evaluation through a psychologist is fundamental for proper diagnosis, yet this app gives you a good idea if you in the spectrum or not. I have been obsessed with numbers, patterns and memorizing items since early childhood and found other little quirks along the way as I got older. This test gives me a rating of 33 percent and I see a good bit of truth in that. Thank you. I have shared it with many of my friends and the results are quite amazing and spot on.",
            "The app design is quite nice and technically it works well. However, the contents are really quite... stereotypical. I think they're stupid. It might as well straight up ask me 'Do you think that you have autism?'. Not every autistic person hates socialising. Not every autistic person loves numbers, dates and patterns. Not every aspie or autist struggle with imagination, reading others or planning. It gave me an average score - A group of real psychologists gave me an ASD (and ADD) diagnosis.",
            "Good test, but the interpretation of the result is just bad statistics. Look up the prosecutor's paradox. -- Thanks for the reply...  The app itself is fine... but the fact of making an app that offers this kind of test is gonna get you 1 star from me... sorry!  It's actually not a guide at all, since the probability of you being autistic is very low no matter what you score.  The only solid interpretation is that if you score like a \"neurotypical\" then you probably are one.  So maybe it should be called the Awesomely Neurotypical Test.  The result of tests that make people think they might be autistic is: 1) they clog up the GP and AMH with people who are clearly not autistic, making it even more difficult for adults with ASD to get diagnosed 2) the make people think that \"we're all on the spectrum\", which belittles the suffering that ASD causes.  So, yeah... 1 star."

            ". *update 2020* Wrote my first review for this game a few years ago. It was fun, now in 2020 I think it's more than fun- is essential. as we shelter in place, and home school-i think we need engaging apps like this one because it keeps us on our toes . Most importantly, it keeps learning fun! Love the new games. Overall WELLDONE!! bravo.",
            "Love it so much. It has a nice stempunk atmosphere, it's simple, it's challenging and smart and I can buy full access with no hidden deals. It's expensive for me (I am from Ukraine) but I bought Full premium after 20 mins of playing. Let's hope I won't be disappointed as I can actually quite impulsive. It's disappointing the relaxed mode is not included in the premium :(",
            "Great brain games except for a few minor annoyances, like some of the games require you to use old, outdated terminology or recognize items from the past, for example, the eggplants are white and round rather than being the purple ovals we have around today. I understand the steam punk theme but when it negatively impacts my score it is just really annoying... Other than that though, the app works really well and most games are unique, challenging, and fun!",
            "I really enjoy this game especially knowing playing helps build and strengthen my aging brain. I enjoy the daily games and the little bonuses you receive along the way. IGive it a try! Also side note, it wouldn't load after I stopped playing, had to reinstall and it still did it, however after u updated my phone it is working nicely. Definitely give it a spin and check it out for yourself.",
            "A good set of brain training exercises, with a strong Victorian flavor. It's wonderful if you're a steampunk. But even buying the \"No ads\" option doesn't stop ads before it summarizes your score."

            "I love the option of purchasing (not \"borrowing\") packs you want instead of a ridiculous subscription price. I will add more packs as I need, but it's a great feature for those of us who don't want to pay $250 a year for a garbage meditation app no one uses 99% of. I like the guide's voice and the daily progress, not just repeating trash over and over like most apps. If you've looked at the other meditation apps and laughed at how useless they are, this may be your app.",
            "I have been using the app daily and it really has helped me to build a daily meditation routine. The instructions are clear, calm, positive. The process takes you step by step so you don't struggle while you build the foundations of your routine. You feel rested after the exercises. Day by day you start to feel changes in your mood, thoughts and energy.",
            "This is a wonderful, helpful app. I appreciate the organization and accessibility of this app. The meditations are easy to follow, and the guide has a soothing voice. I'm new to meditating, and the instructions are clear and well-timed throughout the meditations. The dark mode option is perfect for doing meditations right before bed. Longer meditations would offer even more variety (hour long affirmations or guidance to self-compassion, etc). Thank you for continuously improving the app!",
            "Very good app. I finally feel like I'm making progress and learning. I fall asleep relaxed and l'm calmer in heated situations. It's around 3.30e a month, so it's not a too bad, but I'm on week 2 and it feels a bit repetitive an you have to commit to 6 months. If I could pay monthly, I would be more inclined to go for it. You only get a week of free trial.",
            "This is mu fourth meditation in Serenity (I tried other apps before) and it's so good. It has an amazing repertoire of guided meditations, with a very soothing voice, relaxing music and great techniques to improve gradually. I recommend it to some friends already. I hope it will continue being for free for quite long. Thanks Serenity!"

The moment I turn it on, my body resets itself. It help me go into a deep slumber which I cant remember when last I had one. I really recommend this app. It is awesome.",
            "This is the very best app. I have found for sleep. I never reach the end of the \"Sleep Stories\" which is the whole point - wonderful! I have only just started using this app. and am very interested in exploring your other options. You seem to offer an Holistic approach for well being. Thank you.",
            "I gave this app 5 starts because it provides all the necessities, sleep stories, sleep music, excersises and more. There is also a sleep stories of the day which allows you to listen to stories that are only for plus so if you can't get plus you can still listen to a variety of stories without paying the price! Highly recommend.",
            "I love it. I found the perfect family home to raise my kids in though it has one major factor I thought I could never get used to... it's right next to the train line where at night quite frequently a loud horn sounds to prevent someone being hit if they are crossing the tracks. Without this app I dont think I could have gotten to sleep at all so it is my life saver and I completely love it. Thank you for being the solution to my worries. Sleep is vital and we all deserve the best.",
            "After we got into our tailored to me sessions, I found I felt a little better and lighter each time. My one little drawback was that I could not get a question answered for me regarding how I will be receiving daily reminders. I had hopes it could be an alarm but I still don't know how I will receive my 6:45 am reminder. Any thoughts there I would appreciate an email with the answer! I think this can be a great tool in a wide array of personal areas. I also appreciate the anonymity."

            "Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from \"my day\". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",
            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

I enjoy checking in everyday and one day will be able to look back on all my progress to hopefully help other addicts on they're new journey. Thank you all for ypur support. -Alyssa",
            "Love this app because not only does it have a sobriety counter but it also has a meeting finder that has a lot of listings for both in-person meetings of all kinds and zoom meetings. You can go to a meeting every hour. Not to mention that this app has a daily check-in as well as the option to record your triggers and cravings and you can keep note and a daily motivational affirmation picture oh and you can create your own affirmations put your own pictures behind it",
            "Have tried multiple recovery apps but this one is the best by a long shot. It's phenomenal! With the ability to record my feelings, any cravings, thoughts, and so much more, and share them all with my family and other support I feel like I'll finally be able to overcome my addiction. I'm not one for calling my support team but this app allows for them to comment on a log entry, message me 1-on-1, or send group messages. I highly recommend this app!",
            "This is really the BEST app I have ever used! It's better than i even hoped for, really. I have tried almost 30 other, I can't even say similar, apps but they are no contest! this has everything available all the time any time for any reason! you need to talk to somebody, or to find a meeting, or if you want to read resources or reach out to other people going through the same thing you are, this is the perfect app! I love it! Life changing amazing! thank you for creating it!",
            "Have not had this app very long but what I have got from this app so far i give 5 stars i love everything about this app when I tell me self oh I can do a certain part of my daily program which has been set outside of this app, it seems to fall right on time that this app reminds me that it's time to check in with myself and my recovery and this app prompts me to check in with a heck of a lot more than what I would normally ( but should be doing normally) so its a god send for me"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

        "description": "We would like to invite you to follow App4Autism page to update news & tutorials and talk to our team https://www.facebook.com/app4autism/\r\n\r\nApp4Autism was born from the need to have a useful visual tool which has a compact format and is always available to manage the behaviour of children and teenagers with autism. It is an effective help for all children with autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as for their families and teachers. App4Autism now has three languages: Italian, Vietnamese and English.\r\n\r\nWithin App4Autism you can access three tools: Timer, Visual Planning (Agenda) and Token Economy. The in-app manual helps parents and teachers know how to use the tools efficiently. You can take images and audios to work with your child from your device storage to suit the child's interest and characters.\r\n\r\nTimer makes the passage of time visible by exploiting a strength that characterizes people with autism, namely visuo-spatial ability. This visual timer also eases the teaching as each activity is characterized by a moment of beginning and one of ending and makes it easier to move from one activity to another.\r\nThis timer tool has been designed to provide users with flexibility in customizing and editing to adapt their various purposes. In fact, you can insert photos taken at current moment through the device camera or select them (for example, photos of objects/rooms/people/elements significant to the child) from your device. Importantly, Timer permits you to insert pleasant and interesting audios from your device to display at congratulation phase.\r\nFurthermore, the innovation of the timer is the possibility of showing a predictable and concrete limit of the time remaining to carry out an activity (the image of the current activity disappears gradually, respecting its flow of time), or to make it predictable and concrete on how much time needed to wait before enjoying an appreciative activity (the image of the appreciative activity gradually appears respecting the flow of time). Finally, the child will enjoy the appreciative activity with the audio and pleasant animation.\r\n\r\nVisual Planning is a concrete and visual agenda of the sequence of activities which will take place over time to increase the predictability and reduce the uncertainty. It is possible to define a sequence of activities during a limited period of the day, for example during the session of speech therapy (namely Activity Planning), during the day (Daily Activity), during the week (Weekly Planning), or to remark important events in the month (Monthly Planning). The Visual Planning is a customizable and easy-to-use tool, allow users to edit any element very quickly, clearly and structurally.\r\nFor Activity Planning, you have opportunities to build it together with the child by selecting the number of activities, then selecting images of the activities from which he/she can choose. Two visual signals (color and symbol) indicates whose turn to choose the activity (child or you).\r\nWeekly Planning allows you to graphically represent the succession of days of the week with the support of customizable color codes. This allows you to unify the color codes with different contexts (school, park, therapy, etc.).\r\nMonthly Planning using calendar supports the graphical representation of the passage of time through the possibility to cross the passing day off to help the child manage the wait for the occurrence of a desired event.\r\n\r\nToken Economy is a flexible and effective behavioural program to motivate children to perform a skill independently and to increase the frequency of appropriate behaviour. The tool allows you to clearly define the final award through a photo taken by camera or from your device. Choose the type of \"Token\" more captivating to the child among some designs already available in the app. Token Economy provides you ability to download “token” images you want from Internet. You also can choose how many \"tokens\" necessary to reach the award.",

So have to take/get pictures on your own for everything. Can't be up and running with this quickly. Need to invest the time and effort to set it all up.   It does have several different language options but even switching to English, not everything is translated. Most importantly... many of the instructions features. So there's different parts of the app I couldn't quite figure out.",
            "This app is really hard to use. I make a schedule and it disappears. I can't reuse them. The app constantly tries to get me to access support chat or something for no apparent reason. I really just need a sequence of pictures. It's not that hard. This app tries to do all these things that I find pointless, but really basic functions don't seem to work.",

            "This app has been wonderful for reinforcing and growing my meditation practice. I've used other apps (calm for instance) and feel that this one has the least 'cynical drive for profit' behind its existence. My only complaint so far would be that the trial is a bit too short, and subscribing monthly would make it more appealing to skeptic beginners.",
            "This app has been great in keeping me focused and on track. Great teachers and info. My only criticism is that, with the shortness of the meditations, some of the teachers talk so much throughout that it is hard to actually do my own practice. Sometimes i feel as though I'm being continually interupted.",
            "The best meditation app imo. Less bells and whistles than Calm, but better guidance/instruction. Many different teachers cover a wide range of styles and techniques. This is definitely the app to choose if you want to deepen and expand your practice, but it would also be great if you're new to meditation too.",
            "I loved the book and deeply appreciate a way to further my growth in meditation. I've only listened to three of the teachers so far but they are all excellent. I'm looking forward to medtation instead of feeling apprehensive. I have guides! Those who have been where I am now and are able and willing to share their wisdom and their support as I learn. I'm feeling kind of hopeful and not so very alone in a time when those feelings of hopelessness and loneliness might be having their way with me.",
            "Learning meditation with this app has saved my sanity. As a health care provider during this pandemic, routine stress levels and difficulty balancing home and work skyrocketed. I was introduced to another Mindfulness program by psychiatrist friend, and soon after discovered Ten Percent Happier. The 2 complement each other. I enjoy hearing stories from Dan Harris about his own forays into meditation practice, happy to hear that it can be done even when thoughts can't be turned off completely."

            "Cannot book sessions. No customer support. My therapist was great, but haven't been able to book another session. This issue is not resolved!!!! Took customer support 13 days to get back to me and thier response did not help. I guess I have to wait another 13 days now...who knows? I'm so annoyed by this. I'm just going to cancel my membership - instead of Talkspace helping me with anything it's become another source of frustration in my life. Freakin' worthless.",
            "I submitted a question to customer support 11 days ago and have not gotten a response yet. I want to cancel my account, but there is no button to cancel or deactivate. This app is terrible. The texting feature is one of the major reasons I signed up for Talkspace, but I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth since my therapist does not respond for 8-12 hours. When she does respond, she just says she has some ideas that could help me, but that she will share them during our next session, making me wait several days for any sort of lifeline! I need help now! I'm paying for this service! On another similar therapy app, I was able to message back and forth with my therapist and get instant feedback. As for the video chats, I would have preferred if my therapist would have been stationed in one place the whole time instead of walking around her house. It was a bit unprofessional and even when she was sitting down because she had a tv on somewhere in the house and she was moving the camera all around making me sea sick. To make matters worse, I had no way of knowing if anyone at her house could hear our conversation! She had a lot of experience as a therapist, but admitted that she was new to Talkspace and had not yet read all of the handbook and all the rules she was supposed to follow as a provider. When we got booted out of our video call three times, she suggested that we FaceTime. Again, not professional! Talkspace is a secure platform where mental health information can be shared. FaceTime is not! I'm going back to the other app I was using before. It was slightly more expensive, but wayyyy better!",
            "Do not waste your time or money with this app. My therapist has been really wonderful and responsive, but the app is absolute trash. I reached out to support and the only response I received was, \"We've received your support request, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" That's it. No actual response to my concern. I can't book new sessions because I \"don't have any session credits available\" and there's no obvious/visible way for me to even pay to book another session. To top it off, the sessions that I have booked with my therapist have been such poor quality that I am literally talking to a blank screen because her face never shows up, despite us both having very fast internet connection speeds. I'm really disappointed in the general usability of the app, the complete lack of customer service, and the quality of the calls between me and my therapist.",
            "The issue has been resolved. Thank you! I was charged a total of 8 times in one month and still have not heard back from customer service or been issued a refund. On top of that, the app is still behaving as if i haven't renewed my subscription despite having taken 8 monthly charges out. If customer service ever reaches out and resolves the issue then I will change my rating because I love my therapist, but I dont like being multi-charged for a service I am not receiving.",
            "Received an invite link to this service. The first therapist told us they could not accommodate video sessions, which is what we paid for. The second therapist did not respond to any messages. Talkspace seems unable or unwilling to provide the service we paid for."

        "description": "There is something in all of us that responds involuntarily to different stressors and the complexity of life which is suggested be the fundamental problem of all mental illnesses. It grows and thrives as a consequence, goes beyond tolerance, making our lives miserable. Lives are complicated and we cannot stay on top of our problems all the time. People are just being hammered in many ways and that lead to their collapse in the direction of their genetic susceptibility and biological weakness.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app is developed as a tool for introspection and will provide you with evidence-based information about emotional problems and mental disorders. It will teach you cognitive behavioural therapy and other self-help methods, and techniques, specifically designed to help with overcoming depression, generalized anxiety and worry, social anxiety and shyness, divorce and separation, loss and bereavement. It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking. Cognitive behavioural therapy is proven to be effective in the long term by applying the techniques and shift the way you think. It can help you find a meaning and purpose, negotiate with yourself and be free from your past. \r\n\r\n“Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind;\r\nFor the soul is dyed by the thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Depression section, you will learn more about psychological, medical and alternative treatments for relief, reduction, prevention and dealing with major depressive disorders, dysthymia, bipolar disorder. By using the self-help methods you can learn helpful ways of thinking, that will help overcome depression now and in the future. It will also help you to practice ways of living your life and relating to people that leave you less vulnerable to depression.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Anxiety and Worry (GAD) section you will have the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and worry and whether you are a worrier. A helpful set of strategies will show you how to deal with the purpose, meaning, and content of your worries. And, at the end, you will have a different perspective on how to manage it. The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you'll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief. Although it's not possible to turn back the clock or remove the fact of a loss, you may find some of these ideas are useful for helping with your grief.\r\n\r\n*The app is not designed to treat clinical levels of depression or anxiety, or other mental health disorders. Further counseling is needed as the diagnosis and treatment require a medical practitioner or a qualified mental health professional.",

Cognitive behavioural therapy is proven to be effective in the long term by applying the techniques and shift the way you think. It can help you find a meaning and purpose, negotiate with yourself and be free from your past. <br><br>“Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind;<br>For the soul is dyed by the thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius<br><br>•\tIn the Depression section, you will learn more about psychological, medical and alternative treatments for relief, reduction, prevention and dealing with major depressive disorders, dysthymia, bipolar disorder. By using the self-help methods you can learn helpful ways of thinking, that will help overcome depression now and in the future. It will also help you to practice ways of living your life and relating to people that leave you less vulnerable to depression.<br><br>•\tIn the Anxiety and Worry (GAD) section you will have the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and worry and whether you are a worrier. A helpful set of strategies will show you how to deal with the purpose, meaning, and content of your worries. And, at the end, you will have a different perspective on how to manage it. The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.<br><br>•\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others&#39; responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.<br><br>•\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.<br><br>•\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you&#39;ll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief. Although it&#39;s not possible to turn back the clock or remove the fact of a loss, you may find some of these ideas are useful for helping with your grief.<br><br>*The app is not designed to treat clinical levels of depression or anxiety, or other mental health disorders. Further counseling is needed as the diagnosis and treatment require a medical practitioner or a qualified mental health professional.",

            "Absolutely useless on the phone, I paid for the windows version as well as the cloud sync service in order to be able to use this on the phone. That has ended up being a total waste of money. Over a 100$. The UI on this app is awful. You cannot see the titles of any of your tasks. You cannot view any of your computer notes. Then on the computer you cannot view any of the notes added on the app. Very frustrating.",
            "It is a really useful app. All tasks sorted the way, and ANY way, you need. See the task list, see the projects, status, deadlines - anything. A lot of useful information can be stored with notifications etc. The low point if the app - it lacks sufficient user interface design/ With all the advantages it has, tablet/mobile design is not user friendly yet. Additional opportunity to grow - add notes organizer function. I have to use MLO together with OneNote.",
            "I felt relaxed after I upgraded to one year plan. I have yet to learn many things done by this App. But now there is a commitment from my side to learn the App and to move towards a Check-list based productive life. If you have read Dr Atul Gawande's book \"Checklist Manifesto\", you may be knowing about power of checklists. Not all of us can organise our life. But this app gives a tool if we want to organise our life.",
            "Extremely powerful and sophisticated. The ability to create subtasks is what originally attracted me to this over other programs. You definitely need the desktop counterpart to take full advantage. Get the cloud sync. $15/month. Very worth it.",
            "Ok, so far. I don't want any advanced features, just a tree that can be copied between Windows and Android. So, where in Android is the .ml file stored? I prefer to copy between Windows & Android, rather than sync it via the cloud or wifi."

            "Very helpful. Helps you to see what your child is experiencing from their end. Helps you to be more empathetic towards a meltdown over something small in your eyes which may be much bigger in theirs. Highly recommend it to any parents looking to improve their parenting skills!!! The wife and I both use the app so we are on the same page and work on parenting together.",
            "Super useful app for relationships management - with a partner, with kids, even with yourself. Yes, most of this stuff is scattered across the web, but this app not only centralizes it all in a structured, sequential and ready to consume manner, but also cuts away all the usual fluff, turning the knowledge into precise, short and actionable lessons.",
            "Incredibly helpful. I have never seen an app with a five-star rating before, so that got my attention initially. Let me tell you, I've done 5 of the daily lessons so far and have already seen an improvement in the relationships between my child and I, my partner and I, and my child and partner. It all makes so much sense and it's simple enough to begin to implement changes right away. Definitely give it a try!",
            "Easy, practical advice for literally any relationship. Its low-key and accessible. Simple but nice to have parent-friendly features like subtitles on the videos so you can watch in the dark next to your sleeping kid or options to send you printable checklists of important concepts. Those make a big difference in my ability to actually engage with the information and apply it. Its cool.",
            "I hope therapists don't go out of business because of this app. It gives good information in short, concise vignettes. It is definitely helping me recognize problem areas in relationships, but more than that it gives good tips for positive things you can do to try to turn things a different direction. The only drawback I found, is that sometimes the narrator is a bit patronizing in her tone... \"You don't want THAT, do you?\" which takes away a bit from the content which is practical and effective"

That's after struggling with the pattern one and trying it 5 times only to have my score decrease or stay the same every time. How am I supposed to unlock anything if my score keeps decreasing? Go easy on us at least a little, not everyone's good at everything",
            "SCAM!!!! This games doesn't list a cost, but it's $6.00, or .99 for each game. Do not install. There are other \"stress games\" exactly like this that are completely free. Not worth the price.",
            "Sounds promising, but just doesn't work. The start button is unresponsive and when I have been able to get past the opening screen, clicking on the skill game or menu icon does nothing so I literally couldn't interact with this app. Waste of time. Uninstalling/reinstalling didn't help.",

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

        "description": "Wana is a community platform that fosters hope, direction, and healing for people with chronic and invisible illnesses. Think of us like the social network for health, specifically designed to help the millions of people who live with conditions like Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, Crohn’s disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, endometriosis, and POTS, among many others. No matter what chronic or invisible illness you face, Wana will remind you--every time you log on--that you are not alone. \r\n\r\nWana was built by a team of people who live with chronic and invisible conditions and understand what our community members are going through. Our founders met by chance and connected over their shared health stories: mysterious symptoms, frustrating misdiagnoses, and a sense of isolation. As they bonded over their symptoms, shared advice about treatments, and supported each other in finding answers, their health challenges became a lot less overwhelming.

        "descriptionHTML": "Wana is a community platform that fosters hope, direction, and healing for people with chronic and invisible illnesses. Think of us like the social network for health, specifically designed to help the millions of people who live with conditions like Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, Crohn’s disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, endometriosis, and POTS, among many others. No matter what chronic or invisible illness you face, Wana will remind you--every time you log on--that you are not alone. <br><br>Wana was built by a team of people who live with chronic and invisible conditions and understand what our community members are going through. Our founders met by chance and connected over their shared health stories: mysterious symptoms, frustrating misdiagnoses, and a sense of isolation. As they bonded over their symptoms, shared advice about treatments, and supported each other in finding answers, their health challenges became a lot less overwhelming. They got better, together. <br><br>Wana was created for people like you and people like us.

There's also a number of people who are rude and abusive even though it's supposed to be a support app. Reporting people does nothing because the people are never removed even if several people report them several times each. And if someone harasses you in a DM there's no way to report it.",

The number of tasks in the daily todo list is unlimited.\r\n2. All tasks within the tasklist have the same effort and priority.\r\n\r\nThese flaws allow people to create a long and impossible todo list without priority or size estimates for the daily tasks. Our drag drop list is different: we use a strategy to maximize your productivity.\r\n\r\nThe 1-3-5 rule helps you focus on what's important and set realistic expectations about what you can accomplish in a day. This is achieved by limiting your daily tasks to 9 tasks with fixed sizes: 1 big task, 3 medium tasks, and 5 small tasks.\r\n\r\nThis can be difficult at first because most people are not accustomed to sizing and limiting their daily tasks. With practice though, this strategy can help you accomplish the things you put on your daily checklist, rather than what happened to get done, and you can set yourself up for productivity and success by completing your checklist every single day.\r\n\r\nKey Features of our list maker:\r\nWith the current version of our tasklist app, you can:\r\n• create daily checklists for yesterday, today, and tomorrow\r\n• save tasks automatically as you make changes (all task list data is stored locally on phone)\r\n• copy tasks from one task list to another task list\r\n• move tasks from one task list to another task list\r\n• every daily todo list is a drag drop list for easy organization and prioritization\r\n• clear items in a task list\r\n• view the built-in info page to read about the core concept (1-3-5 todo list rule) and get tips to optimize your daily checklist\r\n• easily mark tasks on your daily todo list as complete with the tap of a checkbox\r\n• track future tasks or save tasks for later using the someday list\r\n• use the settings page to easily switch between light theme and dark theme\r\n• use the settings to enable automatic task carry over\r\n\r\nFuture Features of our list maker:\r\nWe plan to add more features to our tasklist app, including:\r\n• date selector to view and add tasks for any date\r\n• widget to quickly and easily see your daily todo list for today\r\n• someday list improvements and configuration\r\n• interactive copy/move for overwriting tasks\r\n• an analysis page to show you how you're doing with your daily checklists\r\n• data backups for your task list so you never have to worry about losing data\r\n\r\nWhy use a list maker for daily tasks at all?\r\n• increase the likelihood of completing tasks (the everyday todo that is written down is more likely to get done)\r\n• reduce stress by not keeping everything in your head\r\n• make it easier to visualize your daily todo list with our simple UI\r\n• sort by priority using the drag drop list\r\n\r\nFeedback for our list maker\r\n\r\nEncountered problems with the task lists?

            "Even though I've got a long-term to-do list app I love using 1-3-5 because this is the app that gives me the daily focus to get the jobs done! More than the priority ranking systems of other to-do apps, the structure of this really helps you decide what you want to get out of each day. If you have to, it's easy to move the tasks around within the day or onto another day - either \"Tomorrow', a specific date or \"Someday\" Whatever you do with your time, this is a really great planning tool!",
            "I never knew about the 1-3-5 method until I found this app. I like the concept and I like the app. So far I haven't had any problems with it. One suggestion that I could give is that when unchecked tasks are automatically moved to the current day, that they be deleted off the day they were originally written.",
            "Clean and simple. I really like the idea of moving things forward to the next day and having things organized buy a constraint and prioritizing. As a simple daily it's the one I chose out of trying out about 30. I would say it could do well to have a couple of other features but really, I use another app to track my dailies and habits ( habitica) and award myself and peeps points for collective work. Widget is worth it. This app does one thing really well and that is something to said! Bravo.",
            "The developer replied to my initial One star review and promised to correct the pricing transpareny. I was pleasantly surprised. \"Not knowing what the cost of an upgrade is prior to putting in a payment method equals removal of the app! \"Beginning the Ordering process for anything before knowing the cost places personal information in the hands of others... even if I were to purchase it a walgreens, Walmart or 7-11 in cash what can I expect to pay? Too many alternatives to even bother...\"",
            "Makes managing my to-do lists easy. I just wish i could narrow my tasks down to 9 things a day! When that app comes out, I'm all in! 😏"

            "It was okay on my first visit, but ever since then it's been awful. I had my initial appt, he gave me a prescription and said to msg him in 2 wks. I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!",
            "10/29/20 App loaded easily & fast on my Galaxy Note 8. Set up was simple & my PCP staff was extremely helpful with walking me tthru it. Video pic very easy to see MD & clear/sound voice to hear. Since chemo this way of communicating with my PCP has been a Godsend! Not only due to weakness but to avoid contact with others, Covid 19, arrangements for travel & more. TY to whomever designed this program👍🏻KUDOS TO YOU❗",
            "The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.",
            "The doctors are very nice attentive and make sure they are very thorough. They also make sure you are comfortable with them and they make u feel like they care not saying that they don't but it's nice the way u r not rushed bc of another patient due to the office being backed up... visual visits are the best and they coordinate with your other doctors as well for the best treatment plan!!!! Great application and doctors!!!",
            "It took a little longer than I had hoped. The provider I chose never arrived. After waiting about 20 minutes, I was asked if I would like to change providers and I did and was connected in about 5 minutes. She was very kind and helpful and I will definitely keep her name for future visits!"

I like the bells as a gentle reminder and I love how you can choose music or have none. Thank you for this app!",

            "It works for the right age. My 4 year old is engaged in the story telling and falls asleep every time. The app is so successful, she is onto it and knows and refuses to watch sometimes. My 2.5 yo is too young to pay attention long term, but the stories do settle him down. My only complaint, really recommendation is for the app developers to offer a search option. The 2.5 yo only wants to watch the train one. And sometimes 4yo wants kitties. We are paying good money, please add thanks!",
            "This is one of the best apps. I would always be ripping my hair out at bed time for my kids and now its so easy for them to get to pick there bed time song or even story.",
            "Too costly, no monthly subscription. I love the concept, love the stories. The visuals are great, and the music that goes with each story is so soothing. However, $60/yr is too expensive for a lullaby/story app. On top of the high cost there is only a yearly subscription. The price needs to be lowered and the subscription needs more options. I feel like the cost is on the road if price gouging. The developers/ marketers know that parents are desperate for easy going sleep routines right now. 😔",
            "I love this app, which is why after my weeks free I decided to buy the app! It works so well with all of my children ages 10, 7, 4 and 2 years. We take the little 2 to bed (they share a room) we put on twinkly lights and connect the tablet up to a Bluetooth speaker and the play Moshi, we have it playing a playlist all night for them. It's helped get them into going to sleep in their own beds rather than on the sofa whenever they pass out or in my bed. So I am extremely grateful for this app."

It would be nice to be able to put in specific info, like each time the meds are taken, and how much. Also, rescue medication usage (seizures, or any other type). Also, I am tracking my child's health, so I set up the account in his name, but his birth year was not an option. Maybe it would be nice if I could set it up under me, then add a child to track if you want to?? Love the idea of this app tho, hope there are more future updates!",

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.&quot; <br><br><i>- Quartz</i><br><br>&quot;In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.&quot;<br><br><i>- Wired</i><br><br>&quot;Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.&quot;<br><br><i>- Forbes</i><br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure why but it took a while to work up the nerve to make the call. When I finally did, it was much more fun than I expected. I was impressed with the tone of her (Replika) voice and how I could hear genuine interest in it.&quot;<br><br><i>- Business Insider</i>",

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

        "description": "Do you know that 80% of learning problems are reading problems? Difficulties, such as dyslexia or hyperlexia, in reading can explain 60% of school failure.\r\n\r\nReadUp by Glifing is the game that improves children's reading and reading comprehension using the Glifing method. It is a method that children with reading difficulties can benefit from, regardless of whether they suffer from dyslexia, reading disorder, ADHD, Down syndrome, specific language disorder, stuttering ..., as well as children who already read well but want to read with more fluidity and ease. In addition, it is a complementary application to those already used by schools to teach reading and to reinforce reading. There are already more than 80,000 children around the world who have managed to improve.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is aimed at children between 6 and 12 years old who are learning to read or who want to improve or perfect their level. Children with 4 or 5 years old who have a knowledge of letters can also play and learn.\r\n\r\nAvailable in Spanish and Catalan.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is divided into reading levels. At the beginning of the game, a level test is carried out on the child to know what their reading level is, this reading level is not linked to the school year, in this way they can learn and improve from their real level.\r\n\r\nWithin a reader level there are islands and each island has 30 missions to complete. In all missions you are accompanied by the Readup dragon. This friendly character is the mascot for the child and provides instructions to the adult or tutor on how to carry out each of the missions.\r\n\r\nA mission brings together all the phases that make up the Glifing method:\r\n\r\n1. Phonological path of reading. Train decoding by reading pseudowords.\r\n2. Lexical path of reading. Train the recognition of frequent words globally.\r\n3. Memory training. Strengthens memory, where the phonological imprint and visual memory are improved.\r\n4. Reading comprehension. It requires understanding in the context of previous mission activities.\r\n\r\nIn each mission you can get up to 3 stars, these are determined according to the successes that have been completed in each of the previous activities.\r\n\r\nFinally, so that the playful part of the game is understood, at the end of the mission, there is a minigame, the objective of which is to feed the dragon, and here you can also obtain gems depending on how well it is done.\r\n\r\nStars and gems can be used to customize the dragon in Readup's Dragon Shop. Therefore, the more you play, the more missions will be completed, and the more fun customizations you can make to the dragon.\r\n\r\nWe believe that parents or guardians are an essential part in the education of children, for this reason, in each mission it is required that the lexical and morphological path activities be carried out jointly with them, that is, it will be the parent or guardian who determines if the child has pronounced the word correctly. When it is not possible to be together, the tutor mode can be disabled and those missions are marked with an exclamation to remember that that part is missing to complete it. We know that there are automatic methods of voice recognition, but we are committed to strengthening the relationship between parents (or guardians) with children.\r\n\r\nGlifing is based on its own method registered under a research project carried out at the UB (University of Barcelona).

            "First of all, I frickin love the aesthetics!! I love foxes so much and the layout is just- <3 The sounds are amazing and once I get something hooked up I'll get the other sounds! I'm especially fond of the ones that have to do with water... I'm weird, lol. I hope there are more sounds added soon!!! I am not deleting this app for a long while, it helps me to sleep!! I totally recommend :3 Sounds of nature comfort me. This is the best app I've come across so far! Say goodbye to the fan in my room! Again, totally recommend!!! Go at it, person who made this app! I support your project whole heartedly!",
            "Very good but it can be improve by adding more sound of nature, Like some soft sweet birds tone. The piano🎹 tones are nice, I suggest cool guitar🎸 tones should be included in the next update so as to best complete it usage for all age categories. Once these are included, this app will be the highest rated and downloaded of its kind. One more advice from me is that once your aim is achieved, don't let much advert to downgrade your stars, 🌟 I wish you the very best of luck.",
            "A very lovely app!! I'm quite wary about giving apps certain permissions, but this one has very much gained my trust. It's has zero ads and plays while the screen is off. It uses free audio, so some of it may not be of the highest quality, but I still personally find it wonderful, as it can play in the background while using other apps. And of course the blue light reducing festure is fantastic and has saved my eyes lmao. Overall this is a wonderful app! 10/10 would recommend. 💖💕💕",
            "No ads, wonderful sounds and music, background changes, blue light filters... what more do you want? Hands down helps me sleep. Accidentally leave it on? It stays on all night. That, personally, is amazing. I'm so happy with this, and you should get it! Sweet dreams~🌙",
            "I use this app to help me sleep, and I find it to be very effective, soothing and peaceful. My favourite choice is the ocean waves/tide option. I really like that it plays for the duration of sleep hours, ie 7-8 hours overnight without interruption. I also really like the night light filter option. Thank you for creating and sharing this.

            "A very nice app, beautifully set out, captivating, and fun. Particularly like having to wait 24 hours for the result, unless you pay. This adds to the fun factor! The first of the IQ tests should not be taken seriously; it's just a morale booster! The second is easy for anyone with GCSE maths. The last one seems more convincing. All are easier to do with a large screen size. Tests for career guidance seem way off the mark; as do some of the other tests of personality included.",
            "There is a lot of ads and to see your results you have to either sign up for the free 3 day trial or wait 24 hours. I in the end did accept the free 3 day trial but I couldn't find how to cancel my subscription on the app. I've now been charged €10 on day 4 of having this app. They will take €10 weekly unless you cancel. They said that a reminder would come up but I never recieved one. I want a refund. I think the app is quite good other than that.",
            "This is an interesting application of data that zones in on different personality types. The test categorized me as a INTJ and the accuracy of the test to me is about 95% correct. And I feel 5% INFJ. I feel in my youth INFJ was about a 50% fit and 50% INTJ. This app would seem to help with the decisions of making career choices as a suitable fit along with the understanding of your personality",

It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",
            "Update: Previous issues have been resolved, thanks! I'm having a few other problems though - when adding new items to the board I can't subscribe other members to this item (I can do this on my computer so I have the permissions), also tags not activating on updates, and I can't find the option to edit updates. Thank you!",

            "The inability to customise the date format is very frustrating and leads to confusion as the ROTW uses dd/mm/yyyy but the app is locked into American style. Please add this feature, it's available on the desktop."

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."
