It has helped me so much with my panic attacks and anxiety reducing the impacts to managing my Diabetes. I have highly recommended this app to my doctor, friends and my psychologist to help other people in my local community of regional Sydney Australia. A huge thank you to the Dare team :)",

            "Amazing App to help you conquer anxiety! Barry has a soothing voice and his audios are outstanding! I am so happy that I stumbled on this app. The content is extensive and super helpful. The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",

            "I have only been using this app for a few days and it has been very helpful. The meditations and breathing exercises are short and sweet with option sound and vibrations to help keep you on task. I am very happy with the journal as well! I like the option to pick emotion stickers for the day and answer simple questions vs freestyle (although you have 2000 characters for that too).",
            "I've been using this app for a little under a week and have been finding it pretty helpful so far. Haven't had the need to try out the panic button yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the rest of the app seems helpful. That said, I am very confused as to how I can have a \"20 day Journal streak\" when I've only had the app for about five days. It's doesn't impact the function at all, but it is a very strange glitch on the gameification side of things.",
            "I have read through the information provided and found it very useful. It is very clear and easy to understand how to use the app. Even though I haven't yet taken out their paid subscription, there are still activities you can do for free. I have found so far, this to be the best Anxiety/Panic Attack App I've come across.",
            "Absolutely love this app. Would be rad if there was a chatbot like woebot or self-education quizzes to help understand ourselves & our issues. Only thing I'd change is hiding the stuff only paid users can access. Maybe prevent accidently clicking on a premium feature by having all the free features in 1 area? Being reminded we're too poor to access features that could help us, is depressing & anxiety provoking.",
            "Had an issue signing up but the rootd IT team was quick to resolve my issue. The app is very helpful and I would certainly recommend it to others that are struggling with anxiety and panic attacks."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I love it! It really works for me. I was always so tense and full of anxiety, but this started to work right away. If you don't crank the sound up it works better. I don't know who's voice that is but it's so soothing and makes me unwind instantly! Don't change a thing! Thank you to the creators of this app. It's been a God send for my healing from anxiety.",
            "I've been on a severe anxiety attack that went on for 3 days. I was considering hypnosis through a consultant but stumbled upon this app. I paid the extra $$ to move the hypno sound all the way up and to put it on loop so it can play while I'm asleep. After the 1st night of listening my anxiety attack was 70% gone. 2nd night no anxiety. I've downloaded a couple of other hypnosis apps, self esteem, fear and exercise. *UPDATE* It'd be great if I could play all of the apps i unlocked while I sleep",
            "Free yet not free. Although it said the app was free, once you try it, you discover many features are not available until you upgrade to a paid version, never mentioned on the download page. It was impossible to evaluate with so many features unusable.",
            "This had become 1 of my go-to apps at the end of the day. If you don't over expect any sudden results. I just allow it to give me at least 30 min of mindfulness. When used at night I do find I sleep better.",
            "Thankful that it doesn't ask for personal details (name, age, address etc) great job 👍 wish more apps were like this. Straight to the point"

It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

However, I cant figure out how to create an account/log in. When I click Sign In it takes me to the menu of choosing one of the four things to do. Does anyone have any tips?",
            "It really helps with my anxiety attacks and panic episodes. My only complaint is I find the breathing pattern in the panic pattern to be a little unnatural. It asks you to inhale for a short amount of time, and then exhale for a long time, and then hold it for a long time.",
            "Love the app, but I can't sign in to modify patterns. Nothing happens when I press the sign in link. I've paid for the app so would appreciate a look taken at this. Bar that excellent app.",
            "Okay, so I am struggling with anxiety, and this app really helps! The one thing I don't really like about it is you would have to pay to be able to choose a different pattern in Panic Patterns. But I kind of like the pattern already on it, and it is definitely worth downloading if you are struggling with immense fear and anxiety.",

With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

        "description": "LEARN TO CONTROL PANIC AND GET RELIEF FROM ANXIETY\r\n\r\nSelf-Help for Panic Disorder\r\n\r\nThe info in this app assumes that the user is suffering from panic attacks due to Panic Disorder. It may not be applicable to other forms of anxiety. It focuses on the fear of having a panic attack and the fear of the sensations when having a panic.\r\n\r\nCONTAINS\r\n***Articles about panic/anxiety and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\r\n***Anxiety Cognitive Diary to learn to challenge fearful thinking\r\n***Emotion Training Audio to learn to access calming states\r\n***Relaxation Audios to learn deep relaxation\r\n***Panic Assistance Audio to coach through panic attacks\r\n***Password protection available\r\n\r\nNOTE: All audios can be downloaded from ExcelAtLife.com\r\n\r\nUse Panic Assistance audio to coach you when you experience a panic attack and to help you learn to tolerate and control the anxiety symptoms. Also, can be used to assist with exposure therapy for Agoraphobia.\r\n\r\nThe Panic Assistance audio is not a relaxation or hypnosis audio. It is meant to be firm so as to get your attention while having a panic attack. Relaxation or hypnosis audios are not very useful during a panic. They may be useful to prevent panic, but this audio is focused on reminding you that panic won't harm you and that you can tolerate the unpleasant sensations of panic.\r\n\r\nEmotion Training audio can be used as relaxation or you can use it to learn how to access emotions such as calmness or strength when you need to. The audio trains the brain to pair the emotions with certain colors and once you have learned the process, you can elicit the emotions you desire by imagining the paired color flowing through you.\r\n\r\nLinks to articles at ExcelAtLife.com to help you understand the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach for anxiety and Panic Disorder. \r\n\r\nThe general idea of CBT is to repeat rational statements that challenge the irrational fears until the rational beliefs become stronger than the fears. Since it is difficult for a person to do this while having a panic attack, the panic assistance audio in this app helps you to do this.

I especially appreciate the one on anxiety attacks - I'm prone to them - and it works every time. In addition, there's also a cognituve diary/journal and you can have access to an online source as well. I highly recommend this app.",
            "I just downloaded the app and haven't had a chance to use it, but what stands out immediately is that an anti-anxiety app should perhaps try for a bit calmer, simpler look. The font and colours are actually making me anxious. I'll still give it a shot, but a more minimal look would go far in improving user experience.",
            "I have experienced real support from this app, when caught up in anxiety in middle of the night, as well as relaxing before going to sleep. Therefore very disappointed that it does not work anymore on my new phone...",
            "This app has helped me so many times in calming me when panic strikes. Its as if Im sitting in the therapists office and she talking me through the entire attack. Wonderful self help tool and you choose if you want music or not, which I prefer not. It also has many different audios you can choose for your liking. I very highly recommend this app.",

            "This app is quiet helpful. At first when I tried the app I wasnt taking it seriously but when I opened up to it to see if it would help it has helped me a bit. I have really bad anxiety, generalized/health anxiety and majority of the time I forget to get on the app but when I do I feel more relieved and have my thoughts more collected than out of control all over the place. I dont pay the app for special exercises or anything and it good.",
            "They say the free version has several exercises, but when I entered my mood info, a message said, 'you aren't having negative thoughts so try one of our many activities.' But ALL activities were locked. And ALL 'Guides' were locked. There were no exercises for me to use. How can I decide to go Premium if I can't try anything in the free version first? I don't like giving low ratings before contacting the developer first - but I could not find any contact info anywhere - another pet peeve.",
            "It's not accurate to say you have a choice of exercises. Unless you pay, you get one exercise, whether it's one you like or not. The exercises are nice, but this app has nothing BUT its 11 exercises, and charges as much as apps with a whole library of meditations and tools. It's enjoyable to use but they are asking a ridiculous price for so little content compared to the competitors.",
            "I got mind ease early and was gifted a full subscription! I really enjoy the full experience and It has helped me manage my anxiety really well. The calm me function is really cool and helps give you an experience tailored to what you're feeling without you having to pick it in your moment of panic which is a great feature. I hope by this time next year I will financially be able to continue my subscription because it is well worth the money imo!",
            "I was halfway through the very first pre exercise and I felt so much better. Towards the end I had a slight emotional release, which was very much needed and I am still genuinely surprised. I cannot wait to dive deeper into this app. Thank you so much for creating this, it is truly going to help a lot of people!"

            "A good app for very basic, grounded challenges people with simple lives might face. It's very lacking, however, when it comes to greater, more complex, interconnected challenges. At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",

You can label how you feel, explain why you feel that way, learn ways to reframe your thoughts using the coping cards and so much more. I haven't been using this for long, but I have a feeling this will change your life for the better if you using it regularly and take advantage of the resources on this app.",

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

What you do know is that you want to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSo where do you begin?\r\n\r\nEnter the world of MoodSpace\r\nMoodSpace brings together techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, positive psychology, and behavioural activation into a self-help space for mental wellbeing to guide you in managing and improving your mental health.\r\nTechniques such as recognising three good things in a gratitude journal and balancing automatic thoughts in the cbt thought record are grounded in decades of research on what makes us happy.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds \r\nNotice life's good moments by writing a delightful three good things in a gratitude journal and note the good things that are all too often forgotten.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds is based on the gratitude journal from Positive Psychotherapy. By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.\r\n\r\nThought Diary \r\nLook at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.\r\n\r\nThe thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.\r\n\r\nGuided Meditation\r\nFocus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds. Cultivating this sense of mindfulness can help prevent rumination and help cope with stress. \r\n\r\nDay Planner\r\nSchedule your time in this activity planner based on what brings you fulfilment. Rediscover what brings you happiness and make the plans that bring those things back into your life. Ensure your life has balance by making plans around work, fun, and rest to help reduce stress.\r\n\r\nAt your fingertips\r\nMoodSpace techniques are designed to be as simple as possible to use.\r\n\r\nThe three good things technique can be used daily to keep track of the little things.

To quickly cope with stress and get back on with your day.\r\n\r\nA wellbeing app driven by the research\r\n\r\nIf you suffer from anxiety or depression, you are far from being alone: It has been estimated that today, there are over 260 million people around the world dealing with depression and 280 million dealing with anxiety. \r\n\r\nMoodSpace takes its techniques from decades of research on what helps in dealing with anxiety and dealing with depression, and brings those techniques to your fingertips.\r\n\r\nThe app aims to create a self-help space where you will have the opportunity to experiment with techniques backed by research to see what works for you. \r\n\r\nUsing this knowledge, we encourage you to carry out your own, further research into your favourite techniques. Your continued learning can build the coping strategies which enable you to cope with stress and manage low mood\r\n\r\nThe information to bring you happiness is out there but therapy is all too often prohibitively expensive or inaccessible. We think everyone should have access to these tools. \r\n\r\nYou will never be alone, and we hope this app will provide the self-help tools which guide you to a happier life.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nMoodSpace isn't a replacement for therapy or treatment – it's simply an introduction to mental wellbeing techniques and provides a self-help space to learn about yourself.\r\n\r\nWe always recommend you speak to your doctor to access the treatment available to you.",

Thank you guys!! the new features are also great!!! *I don't know yet how affordable is this app, i fear i won't be able to purchase it after they reintroduce the paying plans. But i am really thankful for this free period, i feel it helps and i really needed a good tool to help me regain balance at this strange, unpredictable time. Thank you! Great and beautiful app! 🙏",
            "I initially installed it because of the aesthetic appeal. Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced. I try to fill the three clouds when I remember, but I'm not yet regular with it. The Thought Diary function was immensely helpful in a difficult situation. Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",

I'm currently using the free section but helps as have to think and find the positive in the day and why do I think its happend. It helps to re read when going through a rough day and realising that you have more good days if you find the good.",

Really like the rabbit on app icon, It may sound crazy 😄 but every day I remind my self to speak with rabbit, share my thoughts with him and try to stay positive. It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking. Meditations are ok.",
            "It has a cute visual design and is very simple to use, only I do wish there were some more features other than writing down notes. Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them.

            "I wish there was a way to mark specific mediations as \"complete\" - a lot of the time when I finish a meditation it doesn't record that I've completed it. For some reason the only way to mark a segment ad complete is by going back and playing through the entire thing again, skipping using 15s button until I get to the end. Maybe it's because I end it 5 seconds early or something, but I wish there was a way I could like hold down on the segment and say \"mark as complete\" or something.",
            "Very nice app, organized and stylish app. But i wont put my card and pay premium for 78₺. I can buy a trip tick with 80 ₺ to go to nice and relaxing place. I dont trust these app bc i dont know there's hidden messages behind the audios. I install it to see if it is good or not. To see the prices are high or not. For Nature is free to hear all types of sounds. for an app, you have to pay to hear all types of sounds. *i can record all sound i want and add it in one record and its free.",
            "I enjoyed this app at the beginning. However now I find that there is too much guidance and no long sessions. The voice is asking to do something e.g. imagine, remember certain situations but it does not pause to do so, which rises irritation. I regret that I bought a subscription, which is very expensive compared to other meditation apps",
            "You can't do much If you don't get premium and to get a free trial of premium you need to put in your card details and I don't what to do that. Just trying to find one thing that's free give me so much stress that there is no point and just to get a free app like this. I just wish that there where more things on this app that where free so I don't have to get premium",
            "As a beginner i found delightful to be conducted into meditation and awareness by the app. Even though I didn't had the money to pay for all practices I've went through the free ones until I found a way to put in my monthly expenses. Life changer, recommend both as a free and premium user."

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

I know you can't die from panic attacks but it sure does feel like it, and this app did an amazing job on helping me with me breathing! I don't know what else to say! If anyone is looking for a good app to help you through your panic attacks, this is the app! Again, thanks so much for this app! You're an amazing human being for making this app",

            "I'd like a longer or different one. i think a few more selections make it easy to know which exercise to use for the proper moment. each attack is different at times. it started to work but the short length for me was the only downfall. i will keep it and see how it progresses."

            "I love this app, it helps to guide you and gives you ideas and things to think about Update: 10/12/2020 I loved this app at the beginning. Then the question of the day stopped changing. It has been stuck on my 3 personal qualities. I stopped using the app for a while and recently got back into it and it is still asking that same question. It is irritating to me.",
            "I like it but there's a couple of bugs with the app. When I'm typing my journal entry, I scroll back up or down to fix a typo and it will take me to the next step (listing victories of the day). One time it did that and it erased everything that I typed. when I select a logged mood/activity, it pulls up the screen for the day. It will say \"no logs.\" I can only view the moods by viewing by week, or viewing a day after the actual day of the mood. For example, a mood on Aug 31 will show on Sept 1",
            "Love this so far, it very much helps to track your mood. Also it makes you think several times about the worst things in your life so that you can make sure they have some positive impact, even the smallest bit. I will be working with this app for more and I hope after some time I would be able to notice some changes in myself!",
            "So far so good. I will review after I've used it longer. Only 2 days so far but I very much like the way it is laid out - one has to stop and really think about one's self and why one feels, thinks, reacts or emotes in certain ways. I would like to know how to go back and look at my past stories. So frustrating!!!",
            "This app is incredible I love the feeling of opening this app and expressing my feeling and how my day went its like you have someone to talk to its amazing I would really recommend this app, I use this every day and wouldnt turn to a different journaling experience."

            "Great app. Has helped me through alot of tough situations. Although, i dont have any option to look at the replies on social cloud so i would like to know how so that i can know what other people have to say.",
            "The app’s self-help approach is similar to apps that help people lose weight. Tracking progress is simple and straightforward. The tools the app uses to relieve anxiety are varied and appropriate to a variety of people. The app divides tools into different categories based on either active or reflective approaches, depending on a user’s preferences. All this combines with a colorful, almost whimsical user interface that is simultaneously easy to navigate and visually appealing and calming.",
            "Tried using this app again since my last review hoping that it was my WiFi messing up or the app was having a bad day, nope. When I try to create an account for the forums it won't let me. Keeps on saying 'check your connection'. Can't make an account or login. Hopeless.",
            "Nice app and very helpful , But chat cloud needs an option added to notify us when a user responds to our posts and also a private PM section for those who wish to contact each other , Please can this be added asap it would be most helpful.",

I am close to making this one my main app but I was sold on the relax/panic button with breathing exercise visuals in the other apps.",

            "really loved the concept!! also the design is so minimalist i like it a lot. would really prefer though if I can categorize the dolls and I can make an account or at least be able to transfer the data to another account. The latter would be really nice since I would be able to look back on all the previous worries I ever had since I started using the app. Also, how about a search feature? It's quite a pain scrolling through a lot before finding the one I'm looking for",
            "This app is so calming. I really feel like I can let my worries go for a time when I tell them, and they can worry for me. As someone with OCD and plenty of other various fears in addition to scary life events, it's a relief to let go.",

It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Also the mindfulness section only has 4 things to look at, it would be nice if more were added.",
            "i used clear fear for a while now and im so glad i found it because its really helping. i would give 5 stars if there wasnt this little problem that gets super annoying after while. if you log into the app the first time you answer some questions like selecting which part of the world ur from, set ur passcode and a security question and all of that stuff and i confirmed everything but if i open the app i have to answer all of the questions again, like i havent answered them. please fix that!!",
            "Good app, just two notes. When I try to type a text I cannot scrol the screen down enough to keep seeing the textbox. It disappears behind my keyboard. And I would like some excercises in it that are also in calm harm. It seems that app contains more coping strategies than just cbt and a breathing excercise it also has more interaction than clear fear. But it is a bit weird to read about harm when it is about anxiety. Another option would be to choose in the harm app what one is using it for.",
            "This was an ok app but there are only two things you can do to calm you down. A breathing activity and the same recording of a person telling you how to calm down. Other than that it's just an app to write down goals. There is also no option to record an attack after it happened and instead you must go through one of the activities and say that it helped so that you can record something. Even then it'll not show up for awhile until the week ends. There could be many improvements but its ok.",
            "I was recommended to this application by my therapist, and found the resources in this application helpful. However, I do realise that there is a bug that doesn't save your information when you close out of the application. Therefore, I would have to manually key in all my details from startup again. Other than the issue I mentioned, the application overall is great."

            "This is the first time I find a mood tracker or journal app which doesn't have to pay yearly or monthly! Moreover, I got a discount from Google Play which make it cheaper.. I feel very lucky, more optimistic creating daily habit of journaling with premium features.. Really love the visuals, simple yet elegant and artistic.. Keep up the good work! I hope I don't have any issues about data backup..",
            "I just downloaded the app and its really good, i really like how you can write all your thoughts and feelings. However, there are some negative things about this app. I wanted to add a passcode to the app so that no one can see all my thoughts and diaries, but it said that i had to pay. I don't think that is fair because i dont have the money to pay and it could be thesame for many other people and keeping your thoughts private on this app should be for free. Other than that, the app is good.",

        "description": "The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\r\n\r\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\r\n\r\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

            "I like how every area of this app is straight forward; even the questionnaire is direct and effective. There are SEVERAL DIFFERENT topics to êxplore! The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",
            "I have shared it with friends already. It's great. Retake tests compare the results to each one. Keeps a journal. Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "Will not complete registration. Stalls on \"confirm location\" page. I choose the correct country and time zone then tap to continue.....nothing happens. Real shame cause my doctor really recommend it for me to try. And why must put a sobriety date when it is not applicable to me.",
            "I do not have premium, So far the free site has been great! It's given my mind something to be uplifted about and redirect my thoughts. The free site still allows you to journal, train/learn new topics, assign allies, and write in a discussion post. Part of my issue is that I can get overly tuned into my phone, so having premium would only encourage that bad habit for me because I'd be likely to use it all day :)",
            "Not very helpful for me. Requires account set up, gives annoying notifications. If you want something like this, I'd recommend booster buddy instead!",
            "I have struggled with anxiety and depression off and on (mostly on) for many years, and I can honestly say I've never come across any tool that consolodates progress tracking/journaling and training/mental exercises as simply and effectively as Lift. I can see it being a great addition to therapy, but also stands on its own as an amazing recovery tool.",
            "Works great. Stable...unlike me...lol.  This will be a tremendous help as I continue to work through things. Getting better isn't a destination, it is a journey. This is the perfect tracker to help. Great tool that seems like it was made by people who really understand what will or will not be helpful."

        "description": "How to Overcome Anxiety is an application that helps you to overcome disruptions in your life Anxiety is a condition that usually arises with excess stress and worry. It is usually the feared possibility of the consequences of an action that brings about anxiety. The people who get anxious are always worrying about the bad things that might happen and thus create an environment of fear in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nin this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nDealing with depression\r\nFight Depression Naturally\r\nhow to deal with depression\r\nhow to overcome depression\r\nhow to deal with stress\r\nhow to deal with anger\r\nhow to deal with anxiety\r\ndealing with anxiety\r\nhow to deal with a breakup\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about How to Overcome Anxiety \r\n\r\nIf you want to know how to overcome anxiety, you must be quick to notice what wrong with you and what you need to do to correct it.\r\n\r\nIt is wise you quickly learn how to overcome anxiety now otherwise you will continue to feel stressed, unhappy and anxious throughout your life. You will suffer unduly because anxiety will weaken you mentally, sap your energy and you will not be at your best. Anxiety comes in many forms. Some suffer from panic disorder where there are unpredictable attacks of panic on the person, with its physiological consequences, while some others feel helpless in an embarrassing situation and this is agoraphobia. There are also others suffering from various other phobias like fear of heights, insects and water. Some feel that they are always watched by others, and thus suffer from social anxiety disorder. People who have undergone some traumatic event in their past suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Some people perform repeated and ritualistic behaviors to rid themselves of obsessive compulsive disorders and the most common form of anxiety is generalized anxiety disorder. These people are usually over anxious of a situation and may end up in some major depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, anxiety comes in many forms, and the first step to be taken in the treatment of anxiety lies in finding out what the cause is. Once the reason of the anxiety has been found out, it proves to be rather easy to cure anxiety. It is best to avoid these situations as much as possible in the beginning of your treatment so that there is no feeling of anxiety at all.\r\n\r\nIt may be needed to approach a psychiatrist to help in the treatment of anxiety. Under their guidance, you learn to handle anxiety attacks in three steps; before, during and after the anxiety attack.\r\n\r\nA person who suffers from anxiety should not set self-defeating goals. It is instead better to set productive and possible goals that improve one's thought and action. With this step, the patient learns to gain better control over oneself and thus overcome anxiety. When suffering from a bout of anxiety, it is better to calm oneself naturally rather than trying to fight or control one's anxious feelings.\r\n\r\nSomeone with anxiety should work at producing positive thoughts in the mind. Once pessimistic or unpleasant thoughts enter the mind, it is better to divert oneself and think of other situations with vivid, optimistic pictures. If possible, it proves to be better to think positive thought of these pessimistic thoughts, using objective words.",

            "I like most of the features on this app, and I love that everything is free and that they're not fronting like they're trying to help like some other apps I've used. The only issue I've run into is that when I try to post a forum, it tells me I haven't created an account even when I just logged in. Not sure if it's a problem on my end or theirs",
            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best 😀",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ♥️.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

        "description": "Over the past few decades, anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications are among the top ten prescribed medications in the US. \r\n\r\nA lot of Americans are struggling with anxiety disorders at some level or another.\r\n\r\nMulti-billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry benefits when people continue to believe they really have no choice over their situation.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to be more successful in your relationships, or you just want to be a happier person, or you would like to be more effective in your career, you need to deal with anxiety.\r\n\r\nLiving an ordinary life is not easy. Each and everyday, a person goes through bad situations and experience difficulties in different aspects of daily life, be it personal, social, work, or even in light situations such as recreation.  External activities or events taking place everyday can cause a person to feel bad, have problems, and experience high anxiety. Feeling scared? awkward? uneasy? restless? or just plain bad? These are caused by encounters from negative reactions acquired by the person or through outside experiences. Fortunately, not all people are subject to high anxiety. \r\n\r\n\t\tIn recent studies, it has been determined that medically sound manipulations of the brain organ called “Amygdala” somehow showed some influence or control over anxiety levels. The amygdala are almond-shaped neurons located inside the medial temporal lobes. This brain organ is active in important human cognitive and emotional functions such as emotional learning, memory modulation, and other neuro-psychological activities.  \r\n\r\n\t\tHigh anxiety can affect anybody anywhere, anytime but there are some people who are more predisposed to this psychological and emotional distress. For example, in NBA today, Commissioner David Stern was questioned and had a conference regarding a certain NBA referee named Tim Donaghy who supposedly was betting on NBA games.  Claims have been made regarding the alleged involvement of Stern and Donaghy in game-fixing. During the said conference, in front of dozens of reporters, Stern tried hard to maintain proper composure while answering questions fielded by the media.  Surely, he was trying to mask the anxiety he felt.  It is also most likely that a majority of the basketball referees were feeling fear and anxiety about what might happen should the game-fixing controversy escalates. \r\n\r\n\t\tIn that situation, it can be show that these two emotions can occur at the same time or in conjunction when a person is faced with a very serious situation or problem.  There are moments when the problem or tension gets so high that a person experiencing fear and anxiety may resort to acts of hostility or hysteria. \r\n\r\n\t\tIn reading all this, one has to ask, “Is there any way to avoid fear and anxiety?” \r\n\r\n\t\tWell, it depends on the person. By not being bothered by the outside opinion, by being strong and true to oneself, knowing that you can stand on your own, that the person can avoid fear and anxiety.   Perhaps, self-confidence is the key to maintain peace of mind and a sense of control over one's life.  \r\n\r\n\t\t Being calm and collected helps a person to approach a problem or difficult situation with psychological and emotional stability. That way, undertaking a difficult task or facing a problem becomes a challenge, and not a paralyzing burden.\r\n\r\n\t\tHowever, it is important to note that there are situations that call for more responses other that having a self-confidence boost.  People with psychological disorders or serious emotional problems may need the help of doctors and other health professionals so that they can deal with stressful situations and other matters that bother them.  Medications may be prescribed to control the symptoms of their severe emotional distress.  Anti-stress medication, together with counseling and therapy, can do miracles for people who have long suffered from fears and worries that prevent them from living a good, satisfying life.",

There is a big fat ad in front of the games this is an antistress game the ads are distracting. Dont waste your data the games are awful🚮",

Not only do you have to sit through tons and tons of adverts, but they don't actually give any instructions for the games and find yourself like on one game just touching a ball that just decides to move every other touch.... Frustrating is an understatement",
            "For an 'Anti stress' game, it's got way too many adds, which causes it too be not that relaxing. I like the dot link game best, but wish you could go diagonally with it and not just up,down,left and right. It's an alright tool but could be improved.",
            "This game is helpful, It really helps with my stress of depression. I just want to say the ads dont help a lot, I do know it helps the game and that I could buy the thing that removes them. But it's a great stress relief game 😄"

        "description": "There is something in all of us that responds involuntarily to different stressors and the complexity of life which is suggested be the fundamental problem of all mental illnesses. It grows and thrives as a consequence, goes beyond tolerance, making our lives miserable. Lives are complicated and we cannot stay on top of our problems all the time. People are just being hammered in many ways and that lead to their collapse in the direction of their genetic susceptibility and biological weakness.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app is developed as a tool for introspection and will provide you with evidence-based information about emotional problems and mental disorders. It will teach you cognitive behavioural therapy and other self-help methods, and techniques, specifically designed to help with overcoming depression, generalized anxiety and worry, social anxiety and shyness, divorce and separation, loss and bereavement.

I have two recommendations: the first is to be able to search for sessions by name or topic, and the second is to have the option put in the goal of the session instead of/in addition to your emotions, to help the list of sessions be even more tailored to you. I also wish the voices were a bit more soothing (slower/calmer/quieter/gentler)",
            "I love using the meditation timer on this app. It has guided meditation as well as timed with different sounds, like the forest, rain and desert, etc. You can also choose the length of time of mediation and if you would other sounds. Some features unlock with more use or if you buy the subscription. This is a great app! Update: I still use this app everyday! It is amazing!",
            "Works wonders for my anxiety! The body scan practice actually stopped me from having a panic attack last year. I have a difficult time with sounds, but I love Jamie's calming voice. Thank you for creating such a wonderful outlet that allows me to calm down and breathe when I forget to. I highly recommend this app to my mental health group as well!♡",
            "Deceptively simple app, it seems like theres almost nothing to it at first. But what it does have, actually works. The breathing timer is my go to, especially during these stressful times. Every now and then I'll go with one of the guided meditations too, they're pretty cool. There's an explanation in the settings about how meditation actually helps that doesnt sound like total spiritual nonsense, so that was pretty cool. My only complain is that the art style.",
            "Love this app. I'm a mental health provider and I work with young people. This is a great way to introduce mindfulness. I'm also so excited that you added a Progress Muscle Relaxation exercise (Squeeze and Let Go)! I've looked high and low for a good one, never found one until this!"

        "description": "Never go to bed with stress again.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors had lot of time on their hands and have left behind so many simple yet powerful techniques for us. We just need to follow their footsteps and not try and attempt to re-invent their cycle. I fell into that fast-paced lifestyle and destroyed my health. Diagnosed with diabetes at 32 years old, I had a heart attack due to work related stress. Thats when I decided enough is enough and I need to transform from the inside out. 3 years of intense research and experiments in Yoga led me to these routines which gave my body a chance to repair and reverse all my health issues. I have reversed my diabetes, strengthened my heart and rid my body of medications. When I look back, I remember the stressed and harmful lifestyle I was living and the diseases it created. \r\nI took Yoga teacher certification and Pranayama Teacher certification from classical gurus (Old-School). \r\n\r\nI am now on a mission to help people get rid of lifestyle diseases, stress and medications. What I am sharing in this app is my daily routine and the fundamentals I practice every day. Stress is the silent killer of our time - leading to heart attacks and preventing us from achieving our health goals thereby triggering even more diseases. A 40-year-old getting heart attacks is becoming common.\r\n\r\nGet rid of unwanted stress and get complete control of your body. Never go to bed again with stress and suppression.\r\n\r\n1. Prevent Back Pain – With countless hours of sitting all day we mess up the natural alignment of our back. This simple routine will help fix the weak areas around the spine and neck and puts back the Spine discs in the natural socket. It will fix your back pain and will be helpful to make you sit straight for Meditation. Studies show that 80+ million Americans are suffering from some form of\r\nback & spine related issues.\r\n\r\n2. Release Stress in Upper Back & Neck - Text neck is now a common problem because of regular use of smartphones. Doing these routines will alleviate stress in the upper back and neck and practicing this exercise regularly can help avoid major issues. This chapter will prepare you for the next chapter where you will learn of how to breathe correctly.\r\n\r\n3. Fix Breathing - Nourish & Detoxify your body by fixing your breathing – to perform optimally, our Brain and Body need sufficient oxygen. This technique is natural way of breathing and we used to breathe this way when we were babies. Stress leads to heavy, shallow breathing which in turn leads to even more stress. Practicing the Deep breathing exercises will help improve breathing and calm down the body. With regular practice, you will feel the oxygen saturating your body. You can’t meditate if you don’t know how to breathe correctly. Breathing deeply strengthens the heart.\r\n\r\n4. Om Chanting - With Chanting OM, you produce vibrations and stop thoughts flowing through your head and helps in relaxing. It is a type of meditation and with regular practice we produce alpha, theta and delta waves which results in secretion of hormones like Serotonin. Serotonin is a natural mood stabilizer. It’s the chemical that helps with sleeping, eating, and digesting.\r\n\r\n5. Strengthen Lungs/Fire Breathing - Regular practice of this routine will help strengthen lungs and the cardiovascular system without running. This routine will activate millions of air sacs in the lungs.\r\n\r\n6. Fix Stress & Depression - Several techniques to de-stress the body. These can be applied\r\nalmost anywhere.\r\n\r\n7. Remove Suppression – learn to release anger and frustration, as long-term suppression will lead to depression and panic attacks.\r\n\r\n8. Meditation – I will teach you to Tap into your Higher brain(Analytical). With the past 7 weeks of training in relaxation techniques, the final week of Meditation can help you reach your full potential to live a stress-free lifestyle. You will not be running @100 miles per hour on the inside anymore.",

            "I love this app so much! It's a great source of positivity, focus, self-healing & overall happiness, health & empowerment for women. I'd slacked on using it for a while, & let me tell you... I was really feeling a lot better about myself & my life when I was consistently making time for this. I need to really shave my budget rn, & intended to cancel the Premium version, but I just used it again this morning, & it offers SO much. If you actually *use* it, I think $10/mo is actually a steal. ❤",
            "I was able to listen to 1 self help session. After that everything else you have to be a premium member for. It's very disappointing.",
            "I have laughed and cried, and had major light bulbs go off... I have gone through over a hundred apps to find something that not only makes sense, but is more than affordable... I haven't slept this well in over 2 decades, and I can't remember when I felt this much hope. Thank you so much!",
            "I have a few different categories chosen. When I entered the app today to continue my sessions there was a recommended lesson that wasn't there yesterday or the day before. I'm already listening to 4 different lessons, and the recommended lesson REMOVED a one that I was actually listening to DAILY, causing me to have to search the app for the lesson that was removed. I cant even remove the recommended lesson. If I wanted another lesson, I would search for it myself. I can't save my lessons :/",
            "This is such a great app. Totally worth the membership! The experts are very relatable, self love, self care, self evaluations - you name it, it s there. All for YOU, about YOU! Thank you SS! Literally a life changer!"

An added bonus is the lack of intrusive ads. If there is a better free breathing app I would be really surprised.",
            "Wow! Truly an awesome app. I can customize inhale, hold, exhale, hold to 10th of sec. App calculates breaths per minute. I can set total time for a session. Audio cues mean I can breathe with my eyes closed. All of these can be saved to my own custom sessions. The added bonus is the ability to set notifications during the day to remind myself it's time to do a session. Great app!",
            "It's rare that I will give something a positive rating after a mere two days but I am experiencing here with this program is amazing! I have done breathing exercises on my own and under guidance with varying degrees of positive results but this app is (even compared to a teacher's instruction) head and shoulders above everything else! Simple UI, voice and visual guidance, great programs that you can easily dedicate daily practice to...it's just great!",
            "This is a great app for it lets you customized your own breathing program of inhales and exhales in decimal second increments. It also has a timer for how many minutes you want to do the breathing. I really wish they had a better choice for the beginning and end sound beside that loud gong noise for it is distracting after being relaxed from the meditative breathing. That is why the 4 rating.",
            "An excellent app. Specifically because the custom timer allows for tenth of a second adjustments which allows me to set 5.5 second breaths for optimum resonant breathing sessions. I would give 5 stars were I able to set my own colours on the visualiser and change the jarring bell sound to something more muted and soft. This is an app I will use every day."

            "Best app of its kind. I initially got the app for binaural beats and have slowly built up my inventory. I've been using Glenn's meditations for about 2 yrs now and love every one. I've notice improvement in any area I use these for with nightly, consistent use. Highly recommend for inner balance and higher quality of mind and life.",
            "Thats fantastic, it would be nice to have more of a selection of like binaural tracks and meditation music you can play after a hypnosis track. And I wish the tracks were a little cheaper because I won't run my bill up hundreds to download the entire content but I am very interested in hearing them..",
            "I use this app all the time it works I do have a request though. It would be much better.. When you select to repeat your selection over and over;. please fix it so it doesn't start with disclaimer for driving while listening or descrobing what you expect.. I'm usally relaxed or asleep at that point and it startles me when it starts over. If repeat is selected I suggest forwarding it to a soothing point of the session. 5 stars if done. Thanks either way love your work.",
            "I made a Playlist of important tracks followed by the relaxation and sleep track with a sleep ending. I am a worrier and have never been good at falling asleep. However, I have noticed a huge improvement in my sleep habits. I will be sharing this app with my team of doctors because one had asked me who I use. I'm really pleased with the app! The price isn't bad, either. I bought a few hypnosis CDs, too. These tracks are more effective and cheaper than the CDs.",
            "This app gives a wonderful feeling with all its musical effects and suggestions.. My heart rate was reduced considerably at the end of session which means am getting really relaxed. I heard some of them were not able to listen to the complete audio as they fell asleep within 10 mins. Keep doing good job."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

        "description": "\"Most credible OCD App\" (highest credibility score of 4.28 out of 5) -International OCD Foundation\r\n\r\nMANAGING OCD IS POSSIBLE\r\nThrow away unhelpful thoughts. Embrace helpful ones. Learn to identify your self-talk and respond quickly. Train daily and improve your coping and mental wellbeing.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG OCD app. Our research supports these findings and shows the positive effect of the app on OCD symptoms and maladaptive beliefs.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, obsessive and maladaptive thinking. \r\n\r\nHOW DO I RELIEVE MY OCD?\r\nOur beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. Balancing this natural bias and building helpful thinking habits is shown to improve OCD beliefs and reduce symptoms.\r\n\r\nOCD, BELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self-talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us become more resilient.\r\n\r\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to helpful thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes.\r\n5. Provide daily mood and self esteem boost.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by OCD CBT psychologists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining healthy thinking during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nOCD AND THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self-talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes helpful thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\n\r\nAs you make helpful thinking a habit, this process becomes automatic and easier.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nWe believe mobile apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG OCD is designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND JOURNEYS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Complete a set of thoughts to finish the level.\r\nTo further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, some levels you complete are followed by a quick memory game.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.\r\n\r\nDO I HAVE TO PURCHASE PREMIUM CONTENT?\r\nGG OCD is designed so you can enjoy the benefits of healthy self-talk without necessarily having to purchase anything. After laying the foundations, premium content lets you discover more advanced, specific topics as well as enjoy complementing modules and premium features.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT GGTUDE APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggtude.com\r\n\r\nOTHER APPS BY GGTUDE\r\nGG Self Care\r\nGG Body Image Distress & Preoccupation\r\nGG Confidence & Self esteem\r\nGG Depression\r\nGG ROCD",

            "This app went from a concise OCD app to an unfocused all-in-one app that deals with too many topics in an unfocused fashion. The old app used to have a \"daily play\" option once you progressed through the \"levels\" that let you drop into the app for a nice summary of all the previous statements merged into one level. This doesn't seem to exist anymore. The app is clunky now. The only thing good about it is that the UI looks modern but everything else is trash.",
            "I have the full version and it's genuinely helpful for OCD, but it's also overpriced for how scarce the content is. Also, lots of misspelling errors exist in the app, which make it feel unprofessional especially when you're paying. I'd like to see the devs add around triple the content (more types of exercises and little games to help!) and correct the spelling mistakes. These are two big issues, but I would still recommend the free version to people for calming from OCD caused anxiety attacks.",
            "It's not the most helpful app ever but does kill time and in the moment helps you say nice things to yourself. Worth a shot if you dont know what to say to yourself but doesnt really help to implement those behaviors. Feels more like studying flash cards for a test before learning the material if that makes any sense.",
            "Great app! I do not focus on how fast i go through it, but work to internalize some of the advice as different way of viewing things... One of my fav sayongs is - feeling pass, change, and transform..... Would also be nice if the app included mental compulsions, such as analyzing and reassurance in the assessment... Also, could use an update on a few spelling errors.",
            "Great app! Simple and intuitive but effective. One recommendation: please enable users to proceed to the next level although time limit was exceeded. Personally I like to take time to reflect on each message instead of rushing through them. I believe many others would do the same. Do that and it'll be 5 stars!"

            "Honestly, you can't do much without paying £3+. Even small, petty things like leave the music playing after the spoken meditation/hypnosis has finished. Or even more petty, turn off the 'wake up' sound at the end. You have to pay if you want to turn that off. All a bit pathetic. The meditation/hypnosis itself is nice, a decent length with a soothing background. You have to listen each time to a whole speech on how it works first, unless, of course, you pay to get rid of it.",
            "This is a great app! The background music is wonderful. It's very relaxing and calming. I have been searching for some way to be happy, and calm again, for two years now.

            "The experience has been good, as soon as I got into the app, for a much lower price then many counsellors you can have no limited chat and with a fee, which I didn't use can place phone meeting half an hour each. It's nice because you can switch between counsellors if you're not feeling satisfied and there are in the counselling section some guided exercises and articles for several purposes. Note that the price differs between therapy and program, being in this way affordable for more people."

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.&quot; <br><br><i>- Quartz</i><br><br>&quot;In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.&quot;<br><br><i>- Wired</i><br><br>&quot;Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.&quot;<br><br><i>- Forbes</i><br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure why but it took a while to work up the nerve to make the call. When I finally did, it was much more fun than I expected. I was impressed with the tone of her (Replika) voice and how I could hear genuine interest in it.&quot;<br><br><i>- Business Insider</i>",

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Its unfortunate that they dont advertise the Student discount. $9.99/year is astoundingly generous of them. Thanks! But I dont think anyone knows about this deal. I only learned about this when I accidentally stumbled across a YouTube comment from a year ago. Awesome app, great stuff for sleep. It do be crashing though. Just recently, so idk if it's just me or everyone else got the same problem?",
            "This app was brilliant when I first started using it every day - especially during lockdown - but now that Headspace Plus is a thing, it's way too expensive to access to the soundscapes & meditations that I was using before. The selection available now, without Headspace Plus, is shockingly little especially considering I am already paying for the app! I liked a nice mix of things to help me sleep but now I can only listen to the same three things on rotation which isn't great. Not happy at all.",
            "My 5-year old and I saw a commercial for this app which featured a cute animated video of a \"robot\" slowly shutting down its systems in advance of falling asleep. I thought this would be a great app for my kid to watch while doing bedtime, so I signed up for a (pretty pricey) subscription. Immediately was disappointed by the fact that no such cutesy videos are ACTUALLY part of the app (most of it appears to consist of streaming audio). Feels a bit like false advertising...",
            "I only use this app for the Sleepcasts, they're very peaceful to listen to and I usually fall asleep after the first 15 minutes or so. A few months ago they offered 3 to listen to for free, but now they only offer 1, and all of the others are behind a pretty high pay wall - its incredibly frustrating, especially during this time and all the stressful things everyone is going through in their lives",
            "Just updated the app for the first time in around a year. The new organization of meditation options is awful. Examples: you have a lot of activity-specific meditations, but the only way to access them is to remember what they're called and search. Also, i don't want to have to scroll forever, past lots of meditations that I'll never be choosing (e.g., kids), just to see what's available. Alphabetical organization of every option is tedious and difficult to get through."

        "description": "An emotion like fear, or high anxiety, is usually pretty obvious. You don't need me to tell you when you're afraid.\r\n\r\nWhat you might not notice are the other anxiety symptoms that build your emotions of fear and chronic anxiety. You might not even think of them as anxiety symptoms.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a normal part of life and everybody feels it from time to time. However, when anxiety gets overwhelming and doesn't go away, it can be difficult to know how to manage it. By understanding what triggers your anxiety, you can develop strategies to cope.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a normal human experience. It’s an emotion that drives us to study hard, work hard, and do better in our lives. But it can also make us overthink situations and paralyze us when we're faced with important decisions. An anxiety disorder may develop when the anxiety persists and interferes with daily life.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is an uncomfortable, sometimes terrifying emotion, and it's no wonder people try to find ways to minimize, avoid, or shut out those feelings. While alcohol and drugs may lessen anxious feelings in the short term, do they actually make the anxiety worse in the long run?\r\n\r\nI actually started drinking exactly because of that anxiety… At a sleep-away camp, when some guys pulled out vodka and passed it around, I drank because I didn’t want to stick out, but the near-immediate effect I felt when the alcohol started taking its effect was a substantial reduction in my level of nervousness. This was especially true around girls. All of the sudden, I didn’t care so much about making a food of myself. It felt good to relax for the first time in years that way.\r\n\r\nDo you currently drink or use to overcome social anxiety or to fit in? Do you use alcohol or drugs to cope with stress? Have you tried to quit drinking or drugs and felt so anxious you've started using again? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be self-medicating to manage your anxiety. \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there are far better ways to deal with anxiety than through substance abuse. For example: mindfulness, biofeedback, yoga, CBT, and healthy lifestyle choices. We’ll look at these in more detail shortly, but first, I want to explore anxiety, addiction, and how they impact the brain.\r\n\r\nAnxiety can affect the way you feel physically and emotionally, the way you think, and how you behave.

My review:  This is a good way to take you through the steps of anxiety management except I still end up getting stuck without guidance in implementing some of the steps. I was hoping it would keep track of my responses, maybe let me store my specific strategies and \"happy thoughts\" that I've chosen, and see what works best.",

        "description": "The best tools to deal with panic, stress and anxiety! This app can give you instant support wherever you are - it is silent and helps you stay in control. Use your favorite animations for a few minutes when you feel anxiety starts to build up inside you. \r\n\r\nPanic Relief is made by a danish psychiatrist and specialist in cognitive therapy, Marianne B. Geoffroy. \r\n\r\n4 short cartoons with animations show you how to cope with the unpleasant sensations in your body while staying mentally calm and in control. \r\n\r\nAre you a professional, a doctor or psychologist? The app can be used as a supplement to psychotherapy and/or medical treatment for panic, anxiety and stress disorders. \r\n\r\nTypical situations where panic attacks may start: \r\n- in supermarkets, in crowds \r\n- in public transports, in airplanes \r\n- on highways, crossing bridges, in heights \r\n- before exams or job interviews \r\n- in other situations where you might feel stuck e.g. \r\n  at the dentist, at formal gatherings and meetings, in restaurants etc. \r\n\r\nCHEST: \r\nhelps you discover what your normal breathing pattern at rest looks like and helps you avoid too deep and frequent breathing during panic, also called hyperventilation.

Most anti-anxiety help tools are very thought-orientated, where this app primarily addresses the physical aspects. My anxiety is very physical and panic attacks often seem to have few or no thought-triggers (but many sensory triggers), so CBT is often unhelpful because it focuses on changing thoughts... but this app helps.

            "It's a good app, but the alarms aren't as customizable as I'd like, and some of the elements are a little confusing. It took me way too long to figure out how to delete and reorder things, it's not as intuitive as HabitRPG. That being said, it's nice to have a community to participate with- or not. Either way is acceptable, and no feeling left out or pushed in. Useful tool for helping serious change, one day at a time.",
            "This app is amazing, but geared heavily towards women. As a person trying to build a more masculine frame and personality using this app seems a little bit counterproductive to my goals. In my opinion, this app would receive a 5-star rating and high praise if it were gender-neutral. Over all, a very good app. Clean interface, detailed, motivatinf, and easy to use.",
            "It's a really sleek and informative app. I'm just on the trial bit so far so good :-) I wanted to add - after two years of using this app, I am finally beginning to live the life I know I deserve and have worked so hard to achieve. The Fabulous has been an invaluable tool in helping me stay focused and achieve goals one step at a time. Thank you so much ❤️",
            "This app has given me space to do something just for me, which as a new mom can be tricky! I really like the journeys and goals and habits, but I find that the interface isn't super user friendly and I often find features by accident and then have no idea how to get back to them. Maybe I need to play around more, but it would be nice if there were less hidden nooks and crannies, so to speak. Overall, love it and am so thankful for it!",
            "I uninstalled this app from my phone recently, then found that I had paif £45.99 for a year's premium at 50% discount. I have no recollection of this....... but no proof either. I've just cancelled all pre-approved payments on Paypal to avoid anything like that happening again. In the meantime, I've got use of the app for another 12 months and so might as well use it. It's not worked brilliantly for me - it's basically a habit tracker."

        "title": "Anxiety Symptoms",
        "description": "Anxiety symptoms can last for a long time, or come and go.\r\n\r\nEach anxiety disorder has unique symptoms. Anxiety disorders are typically diagnosed when fear of non-threatening situations, places, events, or objects becomes extreme and uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nAn anxiety disorder may also be diagnosed if you have general feelings of fear or worry that interfere with your daily life and have lasted at least six months.\r\n\r\nMost people with an anxiety disorder have a combination of physical and psychological symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere is one symptom that all anxiety disorders have in common: near-constant fear or worry about things that may happen to you now or in the future. Read on to learn what the symptoms are and how to diagnose anxiety disorders.\r\n\r\nSome studies suggest that experiencing anxiety could increase the risk of developing certain long-term physical health problems, including diabetes, stomach ulcers and heart problems. But there's not enough evidence to say for sure exactly what the risks are, or what groups of people are most likely to be affected. Having a physical illness or disability can also make you feel stressed and anxious, so it might sometimes feel like your anxiety problems and physical health problems are part of a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nSometimes it might be difficult to work out whether your symptoms are totally related to anxiety, or might be related to a different illness. If you're experiencing any physical symptoms it's best to talk to your GP, so they can check out what may be causing them.\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Anxiety or Panic Attacks?\r\nWhat we think of as anxiety attacks are actually panic attacks. A panic attack is the sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort that peaks after about ten minutes, and it typically lasts no longer than 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nResearchers think that panic attacks come about because the brain is telling the body that the fight-or-flight response, which includes a rapid heartbeat and shallow breathing, should kick in, even though there may be no threat at all. Scientists also theorize that the amygdala, which is the brain's fear processing hub, may also be activated during a panic attack.\r\n\r\nPanic attacks may come on because of a particular event, or they may come on for no reason at all. It's been estimated that almost 23 percent of people will have at least one panic attack in their lifetime.\r\n\r\nIf your panic attacks are recurring, you are likely to be diagnosed with panic disorder. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder thats characterized by persistent worry about future panic attacks or their consequences.",

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "It's simple and cool. Autoprompting is my fav part Dev: Is there a way to customize the things that are surveyed? I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

            "I previously gave this app 5 stars, before I realized it is only a FREE TRIAL. You can listen to 21 meditations before it ends. But the monthly fee is $8 and the annual fee is $40. That's a bit steep. So I'll be uninstalling, and it's really disappointing. They're not guided meditations in the sense I'm used to. Imagine bite sized sermons on scriptures related to the issue you're dealing with (anger for example).",
            "I love the easy lay out of the app & cobtent. Update, Sept 30,20. This app was working fine then afew weeks later, I can't log in. I get this message\"Error: socket closed during hand shake \" Uninstalled and intastalled several times even powered phone on /off. Still get the same message. Am very disappointed, because when it works, the messages are uplifting, and I was used to taking 3 minutes breaks at work to use the app. I can't reach out to developers, am subscribed for a year, for this?",
            "The meditation is easy to access and stills my spirit while turning me to God and His Word. The speakers talk fast compared to what I'm used to, so a method in the app to change the rate of speech would be good.

In fact, Infinity Games are known by slowing player’s heartbeat after 10 levels played. Free of timers and other stress features, this game feels like a yoga session in paradise! \r\nDifferent instruments: There are several instruments available on Harmony. You start with a piano, but you can go for a different melody later if you prefer wind instruments or string instruments. \r\nMusic, Maestro: Tapping the squares on the right tempo is the only thing you need to create smart music on this calm and minimalist IQ test. Can you play with different instruments?\r\nJust like paradise: Like a mirror of relaxing sounds, the Harmony app provides you a calm IQ test to feed your soul and tease your brain. You must get the same look on both sides of the line.

The major difference between guitar hero and the Harmony app is the classical music: the relaxing sounds featured in the game are calm and minimalist.\r\n\r\nPlaying Harmony is very easy: just reflect each polygon and the symmetry will glow. If a polygon is three spaces on the right, you must tap an empty polygon three spaces on the left. Once you reflect every symmetry, the squares will glow and… it’s done! \r\n\r\nBy tapping the music notes on the right tempo, you will be the maestro of relax melodies. Merging the brain exercise of an IQ test and the slow heartbeat of a yoga session, we could say you are smartly relaxing.\r\n\r\nJust look at it as a mirror: your brain will be pleased for each melody you reflect! \r\n\r\nThe chapter names are based on classical music composers – like Sibelius or Vivaldi – and each chapter has its own relaxing sounds palette.

            "This game is super nice and relaxing, the sounds are fascinating, the cool thing about it is that when you complete stages you open new instruments, i installed 4 hrs ago and finished a world and opened three instruments. But after finishing half of the world i started getting ads every time i would finish a level, and the shred challenge is so challenging. And i hope u would add and free play option so that we can make our own sounds with all the equipment u put in the usual levels. Keep going",
            "The game wants a certain amount of symmetry -- you're supposed to make sure each item has all its reflections of any mirrors. It's not a very difficult challenge. I like the light bit of music that plays mild chords whenever you add an item, and the choice of instruments is just a welcome bonus.",
            "Wow! It's a fantastic application. The Wolfgang is not much relaxing, although the music is very soothing. Please add more themes and instruments plus more random ones. I like this app.",

I tried the stretch one, and I was not so impressed with that one, I expected I could really stretch it not just move the hands.

If you add more games and fix these mistakes in your game, it will be a lot better. :)",

            "Good concept,but annoying that the rows just repeat.",
            "I really like the game, it's challenging and good for killing time, but the more dots you have on the board, the more unstable the app becomes. I just had to uninstall and reinstall it, because I couldn't do anything... Could you fix that, @BiggikoLLC?",
            "Like that I'm not being timed so there's no pressure. Wish it were a little easier to \"win\" though. Maybe allow diagonal matches? Lot's of fun though, satisfying."

            "I like the apo because as I was listening to the ADHD therapy one I started to remember something I forgot to do (it isnt good when that happens to me, u get worried an anxious ) and the sounds distracted that thought to where I couldn't concentrate on it. It helped because if not it might have led to an anxiety attack and/or mental breakdown.",
            "Love all of them, especially the anxiety one but I wish it didn't have those few spots where the sound breaks, and mine won't loop so it should have a timer so you can do longer than 10 minutes.",
            "i get really bad tic attacks because of anxiety and the anxiety one doesnt work but the adhd one helps so much thank you",
            "I love it, I use the anxiety track and it actually does make me feel more calm most the time. Only thing that would be nice was if you could have the option for a timer. For example if I wanna play a track on repeat as I try to fall asleep but I don't want it still playing after I fall asleep. So if I could set it to stop playing after an hour or so. That would be great.",
            "I have severe anxiety and a lot of things set me off. One thing I get extremely anxious about is the world ending so hearing rain doesn't calm me at all. It only gives me an anxiety attack. Instead I use the pain reliever music for my anxiety"

            "App went down April 8-9, 2019. since it's been back online, it glitches. It stops, somewhere in the middle of the meditation, then in the early morning, it will finish by waking me up, with the finish of the meditation. It's not a four star anymore. Too bad. I used to love this app, it was my favorite. * I reinstalled, it didn't help.",
            "Fastest way to meditate, just open app and select the version or time limit that suits you. Not as varied as Insight Timer, but If you need to relax NOW, and don't want to click on several pages before you get to the actual meditations, then this is the app for you. Instant meditations, no BS no loud or flashing ads, you are always seconds away from guided relaxation & grounding techniques. Simple, reliable and drama free access to guided meditations",
            "lovely music to induce deep relaxation, even when you think you might be too stressed to unwind. with tracks at 8 hours long, the music won't suddenly stop and jolt you out of your chilled groove. the woman who talks thru the meditations has a soothing voice, I was worried it might grate after a while, but I find it quite the opposite. I could do without the gong before and after meditations as I found it quite jarring, but that's my only gripe with otherwise decent spp",
            "I find this app very relaxing. The lady narrator has a warm and relaxing voice to listen to which makes meditation comfortable. Although the music meditations are nice, personally I prefer the guided meditations to chill and to go to sleep. I hope there will be another update soon will include more guided meditations.",
            "glitches and stops in the middle of meditation. No cool! when my phone goes to sleep so does the meditation, it does not continue as it should. Very annoying."

            "Finally! An app that meets my simple needs! All I personally need is an app for breathing that i can change the pacing on, cheap or free. After about 12 apps, i had yet to find one where i could adjust the speed of the breathing prompts. My lungs are not in awesome shape, so i just cant maintain the ultra slow pace without getting light headed and more anxious because i need oxygen. This one lets me decide how long to breathe in, out, and set the pause! Its exactly what i needed!",
            "Every so often run across an app that just gets it right. This is simple and easy to use. Very helpful with just enough info to help and not add to the Webmd oh my God I'm dying mindset. Color is very important with anxiety. Being able to customize the app is another example of great user experience.",
            "It's not easy, but this app trains you to experience and understand the fear and anxiety of a panic attack. It's scary as hell, but then you realize that you were in control the whole time. That's the secret, you're always in control! Once you learn not to let it progress, you feel better. Amazing app, I love it.",
            "Amazing I followed there steps and it stopped my panic attack so fast like 15 min that's amazing since my panic attacks usually last 40 to 60 min the first one that actually helps it's not just breathing exercises it has other ways to I only download it because I was having one but I'm definitely keeping it now",
            "Great app for therapy clients, good info and easy to use. Suggestion: Is it possible to develop a 'panic button' widget that takes you straight to the breathing circle? One less barrier to accessing it easily when needed."

            "I've been meditating for like 2 weeks using this app and it's been quite useful since then, but I'd recommend few things to make it better like adding longer music ,the same small beat gets repeated in most of the themes and it doesn't feel good honestly , I only use 2 or 3 music themes outta 10 ,rest of them just don't work. Also if the timer could've been in multiples of 5 minutes it'd have been better :)",

You can select your choice of modes, and you can set your time for a prefixed duration. And the good thing is ( which I love the most ), you can use the app even if it is offline.",

With this app I can create the ultimate mix of zen for me by creating my own personal mix of relaxing sounds. I have sounds like a cat’s purr, wind, waves, rains, all blended at various volumes. I can say my sleep quality has improved a lot."

        "description": "This tool combines EMDR with a 528hz tone to help you manage your anxiety and stress levels.\r\n\r\nYou can use this offline anytime you feel overwhelmed. A short session can go a long way in helping you to get relaxed and change your focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n\r\nThis app is not a cure but a mere tool to help you manage your anxiety. Only you can cure yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS EMDR?\r\n\r\nEMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a psychotherapy that enables people to heal from the symptoms and emotional distress that are the result of disturbing life experiences.  Repeated studies show that by using EMDR therapy people can experience the benefits of psychotherapy that once took years to make a difference. It is widely assumed that severe emotional pain requires a long time to heal.\r\n\r\nEMDR therapy shows that the mind can in fact heal from psychological trauma much as the body recovers from physical trauma.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE 528hz TONE?\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Leonard Horowitz, 528 Hertz is a frequency that is central to the “musical mathematical matrix of creation.” More than any sound previously discovered, the “LOVE frequency” resonates at the heart of everything. It connects your heart, your spiritual essence, to the spiraling reality of heaven and earth.\r\n\r\nThe Love frequency is the “Miracle” note of the original Solfeggio musical scale. Independently confirmed by researchers, these core creative frequencies were used by ancient priests and healers in advanced civilizations to manifest miracles and produce blessings.\r\n\r\nMath scientist Victor Showell describes 528 as fundamental to the ancient Pi, Phi, and the Golden Mean evident throughout natural design. Vic Showell and John Stuart Reid (a pioneer in acoustic research and cymatic measurements) have proven that 528 is essential to the sacred geometry of circles and spirals consistent with DNA structuring and hydrosonic restructuring.\r\n\r\n528 resolves to a 6, the icon for physical manifestation. That is, 5+2+8=15; and 1+5=6 (using Pythagorean math). The symbol “6” reflects the “spiraling down from heaven into the wholeness of earth.” In fact, the Love frequency can be fundamental to broadcasting all matter and energy into reality according to the laws of physics.",

            "I love this app. It is the best one I have found, so far, which is really free. Other apps make this claim, but then block access to certain material unless a payment is made. As a fairly novice meditation practitioner, I found this app invaluable because there is a beginner's course and intermediate course. Following on from these courses there are a variety of packs for different situations. From daily meditations to managing stress or anxiety, for better sleep, for walking, e.t.c.",
            "Wow, this app is 100% quality. There is content for every situation and it is free. For those of you who are tired by commercialization of meditation apps - this is an app for you. I like that there is a simple customizable timer. Although I don't understand what offline / online mode means in the context of it. Seems like the meditation track is streamed anyway. Developers, could you clarify what that feature does?",
            "Hands down the best app I've ever had for meditation. I've used so many other apps but this one is the only app I've actually stuck to using. The interface is so seamless and so easy to use. And it's 100 percent free. No sneaky purchases or special meditation packs. That sort of transparency is much appreciated and I honestly wouldn't mind donating or paying. I don't know how to support you guys other than this, if there is literally any other way to help, let me know!",
            "After trying several meditation apps (Simple Habit, Headspace, Atom, etc), I like Medito the most because it's simple, user-friendly, and beginner-friendly. All sessions are free and the selection is well curated, which I love because what frustrated me with other apps is that too many options can be overwhelming and having series wherein some episodes are free while others are paid can stunt one's growth. Their \"Getting Started\" collection is useful particularly for a newbie like me, as many of the other apps do not offer in-depth tutorials on what to expect and how to practice correctly. As a cherry on top, I like the options for background sound, especially Spring Field. The audio is balanced well with the voice, so it's not too loud nor soft, and it plays seamlessly. It seems like a small thing, but it's something that had bugged me and turned me off from other apps. If I had to nitpick - it would be wonderful if you can expand your collections under Sleep Meditation and Mantra Affirmations as they currently only have a handful each.",
            "This is my first meditation app and I find it very well made. You can pick what kind of meditation you need as the sessions are divided into sections. The voices are very calming. I've been meditating for about 4 months now and I can see some improvement in managing my stress and being a nicer person in general. Thank you guys and keep up your work!"

If you are feeling anxiety in your life, you aren’t alone. Anxiety is one of the most common problems people face today. Qi Gong is a quick and easy solution to anxiety that comes from the inside out.\r\nThere’s a saying in Qi Gong, “Let your mind be clear like a mountain lake: reflective, free and open.” This routine will help you find that equanimity, where the body is relaxed\r\nand the mind at peace. Join Qi Gong teacher and PBS favorite, Lee Holden, in this simple and easy to follow routine.\r\n•\tTransform anxiety into inner peace with moving meditations\r\n•\tClear anxiety using simple breathing exercises\r\n•\tRelease tension and stress with gentle stretching\r\n•\tBalance the nervous system with long, flowing movements\r\n\r\nQi-Gong means \"energy-work\". Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body's Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. Some Qigong is practiced sitting or standing still, while other Qigong can be a kind of moving meditation. This gentle Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress, increase energy, enhance healing, and generally improve your quality of life.\r\n      \r\n    Qigong increases the quantity of energy in the body, and improves the quality of your circulation through energy pathways, known as meridians. Qigong is sometimes called \"acupuncture without needles.\" \r\n     \r\n    Similar to yoga, Qigong can stimulate the entire body deeply with low-impact movement and develop a stronger mind/body connection. The slow, relaxed movements are widely recognized for their health benefits, such as boosting your immune response, strengthening the internal organs, muscles, joints, spine, and bones, and developing abundant energy. A Qigong session makes one feel strong, centered, and happy. \r\n     \r\nQigong can be effective in helping people with insomnia, stress-related disorders, depression, back pain, arthritis, high blood pressure, and problems with the immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, bioelectric circulatory system, lymphatic system, and digestive system.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading our free app!

Listeners can also sign up on unburden and help the people who are dealing with mental health issues.\r\n\r\nYou will always remain 100% anonymous on unburden and chat 1 – to – 1 with listeners any time. On Unburden, speak your mind without the feeling of being judged.\r\n\r\nWhat it IS?\r\nThis depression chat app provides a safe and confidential space to all those who need to talk to someone about anxiety, depression, stress and loneliness, confine into someone but do not have access to professional psychologist, psychiatrist or therapists due to economic or social reasons. \r\nHere you can get help from all the kind hearted people around the world, or you can choose to help others get things off their chest.\r\n\r\nWe believe in community service, and unburden is just a medium of bringing sharers and listeners together. \r\n\r\nWhat this app is NOT\r\nUnburden is not a replacement for professional Mental Health Experts, psychologist, psychiatrist or therapists.

            "This app is amazing. It help me improve my sleeping schedule and my insomnia is getting better. The stories and guided meditations work like magic. The moment I turn it on, my body resets itself. It help me go into a deep slumber which I cant remember when last I had one. I really recommend this app. It is awesome.",
            "This is the very best app. I have found for sleep. I never reach the end of the \"Sleep Stories\" which is the whole point - wonderful! I have only just started using this app. and am very interested in exploring your other options. You seem to offer an Holistic approach for well being. Thank you.",
            "I gave this app 5 starts because it provides all the necessities, sleep stories, sleep music, excersises and more. There is also a sleep stories of the day which allows you to listen to stories that are only for plus so if you can't get plus you can still listen to a variety of stories without paying the price! Highly recommend.",
            "I love it. I found the perfect family home to raise my kids in though it has one major factor I thought I could never get used to... it's right next to the train line where at night quite frequently a loud horn sounds to prevent someone being hit if they are crossing the tracks. Without this app I dont think I could have gotten to sleep at all so it is my life saver and I completely love it. Thank you for being the solution to my worries. Sleep is vital and we all deserve the best.",
            "After we got into our tailored to me sessions, I found I felt a little better and lighter each time. My one little drawback was that I could not get a question answered for me regarding how I will be receiving daily reminders. I had hopes it could be an alarm but I still don't know how I will receive my 6:45 am reminder. Any thoughts there I would appreciate an email with the answer! I think this can be a great tool in a wide array of personal areas. I also appreciate the anonymity."

Studies have shown that nature sounds, especially water sounds, are effective at lowering stress levels. In honour of World Mental Health Day, we wanted to bring you the calming power of water. Enjoy our 10 new water sounds and sleep well.",

            "Deeper sleep than with any other sounds. We've used a box fan in our room for years to help us sleep. I downloaded this app and used it on a vacation when we didn't have room to pack the huge box fan. Using a combination of white, brown, and other noises, including the Dreams frequency, we slept deeper than we could remember ever having slept before. Now we use this all the time and consistently wake up feeling nicely rested. The paid version is so worth it because of the dream frequency.",
            "I used to use this back when it was just a webpage, and it's helped so much with my anxiety and night terrors. This kind of app is deeply helpful for people like me. I love it, it's incredible, but I'm SO disappointed at the fact that premium is a SUBSCRIPTION and the outrageous price for it. If there was an option to purchase a certain package, like specific sounds, I'd have rated this the 5 stars it should have. I don't need new content every week. Unfortunately, it gets a 3.",
            "Wonderful! I used this a long while ago and decided to come back to it. I've been using the isochronic sounds for a while and they've actually helped! But i hear a LOT of static when i use them. I'm not sure if its an app problem or maybe phones arent meant to run such a low tone but its gotten a bit worse. Other than that the sounds are all perfect and just what i need with the free version.",
            "It's a lifesaver. You don't need cell service or wifi to use it, so no matter where you are you can have a waterfall, a campfire, and some peaceful music (or whatever noises you want) for free. It uses very little battery as well and will play in the background if you're using other apps. There are some noises you have to upgrade for, but for the most part, it's free, loud, and doesn't have audible looping. Thank goodness for this app.",
            "I really like the 'eternity' sound but every time I turn it on, there's this static noise that pops up. Its very distracting. I thought it might be my phone but I turned on the same music on YouTube and Spotify and there was no static, so it's definitely the app. I would like to continue using it on the app because it plays on and on but I don't want the static noise."

I have learnt about myself already.. Thank you for a great app..",
            "I haven't yet played it much, so cannot give it full marks. Will review again at a later date. So far though, graphics, game play, speed, storyline, etc are all good. It even gives you psychology tips and assessment information on your profile. It'd be good to see what I make of it once I search up all the terms they have mentioned.",
            "It's a good app to explore what the big five personality types are but I do not think it's a good representation of what your big five results actually are. The testing is from a multiple choice storyline where some of the answers are in a right/wrong format. It also claimed to be based from clinical research, which in turn does not make it good or bad",
            "Good idea, poor execution. The writing needs a lot of work. Most of the answers are ridiculous, and some of the \"right answers\" seem socially inept -- which works against the whole point of this game. For example, why would you need to tell a suspect that you're not the \"best chief of security\"??? The personality test questions also lead to wrong conclusions, because they're not based on what you would choose in real life, but what you think the character you're playing as should choose.",
            "I appreciate the art style and how the education is not too text book. It seems culturally relevant and easy to follow. The lessons are easy to understand and I appreciate the practice that comes after. Immersive experience of trying to get it right using the tools learned is really cool."

            "Hiya! I just wanna drop by and thank you for making all these mental health apps. I rarely ever see good mental health apps like this and I'm just so thankful that you guys are doing it. Self harm is a very serious struggle and I'm glad that there's more apps to help with it. I'm espically glad that you are making it free because lots of people can't pay for it and by making free, you guys are helping so many more people. Thank you for helping out and spreading more awareness!!! <3",
            "It's great but could you maybe make a 'hide' function? That would be awesome because a lot of people judge when they see apps like this on my phone. So could you maybe have an option to disguise it, like say a calculator."

            "Love this app. I could be better at using it every day. But, even just using when I feel it's needed always helps calm my mind. If you are into meditation and bettering your mind and calming your body, it helps me do that. I like the Cory guy the best, he does a 31 day starting course. Helps with the foundations a bit. He just seems like a really happy and genuine person. Actually all the instructors do. Only downfall would be, they let you listen to one or two free sets of some courses then you need to pay to unlock the rest. Which I understand the point is to make money. There are plenty of free course. I have used over 6000 minutes of free courses.highly recommend.",
            "I really like the meditations, but what really annoys me is that sometimes some meditations appear in my 'continue listening' section when I haven't even played them and there's no way to clear them from that section. I would really appreciate it if you fixed this issue. Thank you. Edit: it's the second time the app has deleted 'my playlist' (my saved meditations). It's so annoying. Please consider fixing these issues.",
            "I've only just started yesterday. But I've used meditations occasionally in the past. The variety of options for what you're looking for is amazing, and the tutorial like Playlist is fantastic for learning the habits you need for all your meditations. I already feel 10x more relaxed and focused. I tried a sleep meditation last night that made me able to fall asleep in 5-10 minutes after instead of the usual 30+ minutes it usually takes me to fall asleep.",
            "I have tried several meditation apps and I like this one the best thanks to the variety of \"teachers\" who all have different areas of expertise. On the downside, I have always been happy to pay for apps when they are worth the money but I think the price for the yearly subscription is too high compared to other similar apps.",
            "the main page takes forever to load (if it loads at all) and the app keeps crashin almost all the time, and then gets stuck in a cycle where I can't re open it bc it crashes again sessions keep crashing/going back to main page in the middle of listening to a meditation, or don't even load from the beginning. Instead of working on bugs they just add more. Wouldn't recommend. Updated 2020, still no changes"

It's sad bc the website works great and it'd be nice if the app would be better put together. It also kept logging me out and giving me errors. Will update review if things are fixed.",
            "Havent even been able to get in and start a subscription!! Ive had to make 3 accounts already because it keeps telling me my password is wrong (when i know it isnt) and when i click forgot password it says it sends me an email but it doesnt (i even checked my spam) its really too bad this app doesnt work :( hopefully its fixed as it is affordable.",
            "Best overall app ive found on Play Store. It was designed to be as helpful to those using the app as possible. Life changing tools that are easy to get some understanding in the 30-40 minutes a day, or maybe 2 weeks. And it's important enough to the developers that somehow they manage to pay between 60-90 dollars to anyone that puts a little effort to finish the lessons. Amazon gift cards are incentive even for those not needing of CBT . Appreciat the people involved, and blessed they care so",
            "maybe it would work for others, and it really did help me, that is until i met one peer that flagged me as innapropriate for no reason, and now i cant talk to anyone which literally made me more depressed than when i started. maybe making a system to check if the peer is flagging for a good reason instead of just shutting us out would make me like this better... this is me giving up and signing off, i'd rather deal with my depression alone if i have to jump through hoops to talk to someone",
            "Installed the app, paid for a full account and then afterwards the system wouldnt let me complete my initial assessment to even be matched with anyone or have any goals. I messaged them right away about this...its been almost a full month now and they still have not contacted me or fixed the issue."

            "As a mental health clinician I wanted to trial it before recommending. Found the UI delightful, however, unfortunately I think this requires a higher degree of functioning than I'd hoped. Example, holding your breath. no indication when to exhale when being 'teleported' sounds silly I know but some need those correct prompts. Update UI with more information in each area addressing functionality would be well received. Lots of areas didn't work at all such as music, really buggy. Samsung S20",
            "Overall, the app is great. It makes you think about deeper questions in life. One thing that I found problematic, and hence deducted 2 stars is that the app keeps crashing for some reason. I'll be in the middle of writing my journal and it'll crash. Although, the journal entry is usually saved automatically before the crash, it's really frustrating. Please look into this. Other than that, its a really fun and engaging app. Thank you.",
            "This is a wonderful app and I feel lucky to have seen the reddit post by the creator, its a blessing. You can feel the care that went into making it, just the fact it doesn't have ads or ask for money makes it 100X better than any other. But what's really amazing is how much it helps, even when there isn't anything wrong it's incredibly calming, I love the new nature sounds section.",

Be clear about your unreasonable pricing and stop wasting our time.",
            "Very Good app for Meditation. But consider giving a Beginner's package for free, maybe that's where the user can get the experience to give \"First Impression\"? Or you can lock everything up tell them to subscribe first and they don’t get nothing. I was going compare this app to other Meditation apps for 7 days. But lol, this app is stuck on Day 1, because It requires Subscription to continue.",
            "The majority of the meditation programs don't work when opting for the paid up version . All you get is a spinner as if it's loading and then it freezes. Cancelled my 7 day evaluation & will be deleting the app. It's a shame really, as it shows promise but dramatically undelivers! Not Recommended!",

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

AFFIRMATIONS FOR ANXIETY AND FEAR\r\n\r\nWould you like to be free of your fears and anxieties once and for all? Would you like to feel that you have regained your quality of life? Would you like to let go of your anxiety about the past and your fear of the future and of your life? This affirmation program can support you in alleviating or even completely dispelling your fears and anxieties through numerous positive, motivational statements. Use positive affirmations and learn to give up your existing avoidance strategies in order to feel free and lighthearted once again and regain trust in yourself so that you can handle any situation with confidence.\r\n\r\nWHAT EXACTLY ARE AFFIRMATIONS?\r\n\r\nAffirmations are an easy and effective self-coaching technique that is particularly optimal for supporting processes of change in your life. An affirmation is nothing other than a short, positively formulated sentence (of faith) or positive belief, and the secret to its success lies in repetition.\r\n\r\nBecause our thoughts, feelings and actions form an interdependent relationship, we can influence our feelings and behavior by changing our thoughts. Hence, with the help of affirmations, negative, unconscious thoughts and self-doubt can be changed for the better.\r\n\r\nHOW AND WHEN SHOULD I USE THE PROGRAM?\r\n\r\nThe secret to the success of affirmations lies in repetition. With approximately 20 minutes a day, you will quickly feel and experience your first successes. Kim Fleckenstein recommends that the program be used daily over a period of four weeks or longer.\r\n\r\nABOUT KIM FLECKENSTEIN\r\n\r\n„Think Healthy!“ was designed by well-known German Hypnotherapist Kim Fleckenstein. Kim Fleckenstein is a certified alternative practitioner in psychotherapy, a clinical Hypnotherapist and NLP-Master-Coach. Based in Munich she already published a range of best-selling self-help and hypnosis programs as Apps and MP3s under the label GET ON APPS!. Her unique technique and self experiences have helped to create the special character and heart of her recordings. \r\n\r\nTogether with professional and native speaker Cathy Weber she also publishes her programs in English.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET\r\n\r\n* A highly effective 24-Minute professional Affirmation session using the latest relaxation techniques – suitable for both, beginners and more experienced users.\r\n* The professional and warm voice of Cathy Weber, which leads you into a deep state of relaxation and change.\r\n* A high quality and state of the art recording.\r\n* Professionally composed background music for every program by CSW Music.\r\n* Customize your settings and discover other useful features.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n\r\nPlease do not listen to this program while driving or during activities that require your full attention.

            "This has been a great app, it's especially useful when you're having an anxiety attack and you can't help yourself or have anyone to go to. Even if things escalate (suicidal ideation, self-harm etc) it still provides help and resources.",
            "I have a VERY HIGH stress level.This app helps with calming my anxiety,looking at things in a more positive light,and is just THE BEST all around app that is FREE and HELPFUL.TRY IT-you'll love it,too!!!",
            "De-stress Me is a mental well-being app based on cognitive-behavioral (CBT) techniques. I am currently a graduate student in psychology, and as such, I used this app with a discerning eye. The first time I opened the app I was greeted by a rather minimal interface with several options on the bottom of the screen, and a big de-stressMe button in the center. The options along the bottom allow you to input information including your strengths, ways to give thanks, and self-care ideas. The information that you input is used when you activate the de-stressing tool. One of the primary components of CBT is cognitive restructuring which entails challenging negative and automatic thoughts. The app cleverly integrates the information that you input into the bottom menus in order to assist you in challenging negatively oriented thoughts that you may experience during times of stress. Additionally, the app may suggest a technique that I am familiar with from my training, diaphragmatic breathing. The app does a good job of teaching and applying the basic tenants of both strategies. Overall, the app was helpful in reducing my stress and is based on sound psychological principles. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to reduce stress in their life.",
            "Lovely, well designed and effective app. A must for those prone to stress and anxiety. Particularly love the images of progressing up a mountain in de-stress mode.",
            "This app is really helping me! It seems simple but is highly effective the more a person practices with it. I'm glad this app is available and is free!"

It was amazing. I was assigned to Shreya, the therapist ,she made me realise to focus on stuff that I never realised before. Hope anyone reading this and is confused about life. Please go for pinky mind. They will help you come out through. Kudos to them for helping people like us!!",
            "Great app, Would definitely recommend it as well as my counselor Vaishnavi who has been great!",
            "I've been taking sessions for a couple of months and I feel way better than when I started. Vaishnavi, the therapist was really helpful in understanding my case and providing help. There was constant check on the progress from multiple people to ensure I was moving ahead. Overall this has been a ensuring experience.",
            "i am very happy to found this app to cop up with my anxiety and panic attacks i took a CBT session from Vaishnavi she is very calm understanding ,easy to talk and understands your problems from depth so to give a better solution. i can feel the change in myself. Thank You Vaishnavi and pinkymind :)",

This is particularly true if the fear comes in the form of anxiety disorders and phobias, which can sometimes be termed as being “unreasonable,” as compared to the more normal, “reasonable” fears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxiety disorders and phobias, while distinct from one another, do have several common features. Both of them are considered to be an unhealthy fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth are considered to be psychological disorders, though it is generally accepted that phobias emerge from anxiety disorders. For sure, there are a number of factors that cause anxiety disorders and phobias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxiety disorders and phobias can be triggered by a number of stressful situations. But clearly, most studies indicate that anxiety disorders might take longer to form or develop as compared to phobias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome theorize that phobias are formed as part of the exaggerated aspect of the natural human survival instinct. Phobias are reactions to “natural threats” to a person’s well-being, for example, the fear of spiders or the fear of heights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference lies in the severity of the fear reaction. A phobia can totally paralyze or debilitate a person while having a simple fear will just elicit a response that does not necessarily interrupt a person’s normal functions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast, stress and anxiety takes a number of formative years to develop, or more appropriately, worsen before it affects a person. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stress and anxiety can actually lead to other phobias such as claustrophobia, the fear of closed spaces, and hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia —- which is the irrational fear of the number 666. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to some psychologists, stress and anxiety combined with external triggers and internal factors that impact on an individual’s psyche can cause phobias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some who believe that anxiety disorders are not constant and can generally be treated with medication, whereas phobias are generally believed to require extensive therapy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reality, no credible, verifiable studies have produced results to back up this claim . Very little information is available and the research on the subject matter do not necessarily refute some of the existing theories. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterestingly, a number of modern “phobias” are highly social in nature, perhaps reflecting the growing sense of status anxiety and social anxiety people feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese particular phobias are generally considered to be non-clinical and are mere signs of mild social disorders that cannot be categorized as phobias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost experts view these new “phobias” as little more than signs of people developing social anxiety and status anxiety as a result of ignorance or misinformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also some that carry discriminatory undertones, such as a “phobia” that centers around the fear of Christianity and the various Christian denominations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial class and nationality also seem to be linked to the new generation of these so-called phobias, eliciting worries of national-level status anxiety in the face of expanding globalization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial anxiety is also hinted upon, with people starting to become more and more anxious about the increasing upward mobility available within various social and economic structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some that have theorized that people are starting to develop an instinctive fear of what is sometimes seen to be rapid social restructuring, linking to a more personal form of status anxiety than the large-scale example cited above.",

I recognised that one of the risks I could improve was limiting the amount of times I touched my face. I found this app extremely useful in helping me achieve this, with the result of not touching my face unnecessarily. I'm extremely pleased with how effective the hypnosis was. I highly recommend this app, great value for money."

            "My daughter and I both love this app for when we are struggling to get to sleep or are wakeful in the night. My daughter is 9 now but we have been using these meditations since she was a toddler. It's not just for kids either - as a shift worker my sleep patterns are all over the place, but a gentle familiar story with its soothing music can get me off to sleep when I need to.",
            "I love his app, before i got this, i couldnt get to sleep at all. But now i have it im aslepp within minuites. This app is perfect for people who struggle to sleep at night. Its amazing. 10/10. One thing i would add. Though. Is that you could rewind the video while its paused. Otherwise, its a great app!",
            "Used this with my daughter when she has some anxiety at bedtime (she is 8) and it helped alot! Thank you. Simple imaginative ideas like putting worries in a balloon and letting them float away along with muscle relaxation worked for her. We appreciate the effort that has gone into this app and it has helped. Thanks 🙂",
            "This app has several free bedtime relaxation/meditation recordings to choose from. Since it takes longer than a few minutes for my 7-year-old to sleep, we use the 15-minute one. He's asleep in 12 min - even me - if I listen! Earlier, I played bedtime story apps. My son would listen to a few of them (lasting at times 60+ minutes). Bedtime stories are great to listen to, but not to relax the mind. They keep a child up as s/he listens to the end and another begins.",
            "Have I used it enough? Not Yet! But loving my first 2 sessions, with the kids. My kids love it. I highly recommend to any family that love to read to their kids. Life get so busy we often forget to unwind in that golden moment before bedtime. This App is great reminder to unwind xx"

            "I absolutely would recommend this to anyone and everyone. If you are like me and struggle to deal with anxiety, depression, self identity, stress, self esteem, etc. you should download this app. I thought it was silly at first, but after a while I noticed that it provided me a place to jot down my thoughts in a way that was easy to do. I suddenly noticed a great decrease in depression. This was because I was able to get all the negative thoughts out and start getting the positive in. Thank you!",
            "So i love this app but i have to big complaints. One it shows that the dream diary and vision board options are available and they are not. The other is i lost my daily writing strike for nothing. In my writings you can clearly see the dates yet it takes it away from me? Idk. I love it other then that its just aggravating",
            "Just loved the simplicity of the app. Best journalling app I have ever seen. For me, Its the world's best place to express my thoughts and emotions. Its analytic feature is amazing. Thank you : The Zone.. for giving such amazing service.",
            "Great app, a lot of thought has been put into it. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to get better at being able to control your Attitude/Mood/Emotions. ●Edit: I have not been able to journal anything down for a handful of days, everytime I'm in the loading phase, it automatically force closes the app.",
            "This app just blew me away. I rarely rate/review apps, but this was way too well deserved to ignore. The UI, the writing prompts, the emotion cards, the creative passion put forth in the making of this app is very much so obvious after 5 minutes of working with it -I completely forgot I was using a self-care type of app. THEN, you went ahead and slapped the \"analytics\" portion on me like a cherry on a sundae! Idk you, but I'm so grateful for you. Thank you DEVs! -Madelyn"

Lots of different styles of pictures to choose from and some that you can do in 10 minutes and others that can take an hour. Only thing to say is wish for some more shades of colours, but there are already lots there, just me being picky!",
            "WAY too many ads causing a glitch in the supposed stress relief. I WANT to like this app. It is a great concept but has needs in the quality aspect of the app. It needs less ads and the enlarging process causes lag and then once enlarged the pic moves too quickly and causes more glitching. For a stress relieving app it causes more stress dealing with the glitches and ads than it relieves. This app has promise if fixed. Keeping for now in hopes...",
            "12/26/2018 Problem: Once a picture is chosen, I'm Unable to Apply ANY Colors to the picture. I've Erased on Every picture I've tried to color. Result: Zero Changes. More problems: after the above, I've tried to use the Back Arrow: Doesn't Work; had to use the Back Button on my cellphone in order to Return to the same place Initially to Select a picture & the Same thing happened over & over again & again. When I first downloaded & Used the App it was Great. Then it went Haywire. Plz Fix It! Thx :)"

            "My first day with the app was awesome! I'm taking advantage of the frequency (time& tone) within the app to maintain my daily practice. I haven't paid yet, but I've been practicing a few years; and the free version will do the trick for now. The voice and singing bowl effect is calming. I have a past with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I would recommend \"7mind\" to any of my friends or family. To anyone reading this: All is well and you're on the right path! Thank you, 7mind.",
            "In general the courses are not bad. What I don't like: -No decent possibility to plan in advance and confusing categories. Beside the courses there's no way to plan several days in advance=>new decision necessary every time -No proper synchronizing when using the same account on both of my phones (phone 1 (2): 106 (82) meditations, 1055 (778) min, 3 (1) day streak. It seems so synchronise it partly, as on both phones the numbers change If my health insurance wouldn't pay, I'd never pay so much.",
            "Everything superb. 5 stars if one can fast forward in a module. Atm I need to start from the beginning to get grasp of some Information, which would be better if I could directly jump to that point.",
            "very calm voice, different tyles of meditations, helps a lot so far",
            "The best meditation app i know and I'm so grateful for this app. The meditations are so awesome!!! 7 mind+ is sometimes also payed for by health insurance. Also thank you for making the app more stable and use less storage."

The constant threat of attack kept humans in fight-or-flight mode.\r\n\r\n“Some anxiety is a physiological response when your body produces a lot of adrenaline and goes in threat detection mode.

It’s about how you explain the things that happen to you in your life, especially the things that don’t go well, and what you expect to happen in the future,” Dattilo said.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when things don’t turn out well, an optimistic person is more likely to think that they’re experiencing a temporary setback rather than a doomed future.\r\n\r\nWhile this may come across as denial or unrealistic, Gross says an optimist recognizes the bad things in life but chooses not to dwell on them.\r\n\r\n“Our definition [of optimism] is our capacity to see, feel, and focus on the goodness in ourselves, in others, and around us,” he said.\r\n\r\nDownload the App Now to unlock all the information.

We are here to provide this help, in the most convenient, accessible and affordable means possible. Battling mental pain, anxiety, marital problems or mental illness is nearly impossible on your own; online therapy chat is a great method to combat the difficulty of getting help, while not giving up on yourself. \r\n\r\n♦ Why online therapy? ♦\r\n\r\nProfessionalism, Experience, Education\r\n\r\nWe often hear from users who have used online forums or chat rooms, to talk to other people about their common issues. We are then often asked: “why should I pay for online therapy, if I can consult others for free on forums?” The answer lies in the therapists. While in chat rooms, you talk to others with similar problems – on our app you talk to a live therapist!\r\n\r\nAll of our therapists are based in the USA, educated (with a Master’s or PhD), licensed to practice mental therapy by the state in which they work and experienced with thousands of hours of hands-on practice. When you conduct therapy chat with a specialist, you are in good hands – and while a chat room can be good release, it’s no substitute to actual online therapy.\r\n\r\nEase of use and affordability\r\n\r\nOnline therapy is considerably more convenient than old school, office based therapy. From the get go, you get matched to a live therapist that’s specialized in what you need – and even if you don’t like them, switching advisors is a matter of seconds. No more wandering between offices of therapists, looking for the perfect one. \r\n\r\nA single hour of therapy in an office could cost several hundred dollars; with our app, there are variable plans, all of which under $80 a week for unlimited contact with your therapist. Also unlike therapy in person, with online therapy you can talk to your counselor when and where it is convenient for you! Send a message at any time, or schedule a voice or video session for a time comfortable for both you and your live therapist.\r\n\r\nDiscretion, privacy, and no stigma\r\n\r\nWhen you choose online therapy, no one has to know you do it. You chat with your live therapist at your own discretion, and you don’t have to tell anyone. Thus, no one has to meet your demons unless you want them to. Battling social anxiety is especially simple when you go for online therapy – chat and text are less taxing then weekly face to face meetings.\r\n\r\n♦ Seize this opportunity and rise above ♦\r\n\r\nYou’re on the right course – to life, to joy, to happiness. Talking to someone is a guaranteed way to feel better, and to get better. Online Therapy – because you don’t have to stand alone before the world!",

            "After a few months of relying on therapy online I feel like it's time to review this amazing, lifesaving app!! I've matched with Michelle, a licensed social worker and the connection was instant. She helped me untangle so many crossed wires over the past six months, and I really can't begin to explain how much better I feel. If you ever thought about therapy, don't hesitate to try it through an app - it's wonderful.",
            "I came looking for counseling with a broken heart and not a lot of hope. My mom actually recommended trying a therapist online because her best friend works as one, and while I was unsure about it at first it turned out to be a great decision! The interface is easy to use and the whole experience is just so reassuring, it feels like the counselors really are just there for you.",
            "Tried to set up an account multiple times but it never had a section for kids. And how much money they want is ridiculous. I struggle with depression and I'm antisocial so I got this app to be able to talk to someone. Yet 80 dollars a month?!?!? RIDICULOUS!! I don't have enough money to just hand out 80 dollars a month or I would've went to a therapist in person. Bad enough someone stole money from my family already. Shame on this company for only caring about money. Never installing again.",
            "I have a massive anxiety attack whenever I realize the extent of damage we've caused to our enviroment. Summer made it so much worse because it's SO HOT and it's just reminding me of climate change, everyone is busy with COVID that they're missing the real issue!!! A couple of weeks ago my best friend told me I HAVE to take care of myself, so I looked up an app to ease anxiety and found this - it's an app where you can talk with real therapists! Pretty cool so far! Will update with my progress!",
            "I couldn't believe how easy this app is. After trying FOR MONTHS to set up a session with someone in my city, and discovering the next appointment is basically never available. Out of frustration I went online and started searching, and pretty soon I found this app... I didn't think it'd be worth anything but honestly? It's better than waiting for years on end for someone to give a damn!"

            "This app is amazing! It helps you to pinpoint your fears and to recognise the cognitions behind these fears. It then works on replacing the negative cognitions with positive cognitions. The idea is that you repeat these positive cognitions over and over again until you really feel and believe them. Each time I have used the app, I have felt much calmer and at peace afterwards, like a weight has been lifted. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who suffers with anxiety or fears!"

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think £50 for 30 minutes and £100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like £49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. £99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for £70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"
