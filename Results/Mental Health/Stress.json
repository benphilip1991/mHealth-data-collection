            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best üòÄ",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "Scanner takes 3 minutes and if it thinks your finger moved at all it restart. It can be very frustrating and obviously a probability towards the accuracy of the final scan. I'm still sticking with it I'm going to give it a 30-day trial I'm halfway through that. I find it useful but I do think that you should be able to add more tags.",
            "This is a good app. I compared the results using Samsung Health stress meter ( I use a Note phone which has a heart rate monitor), and they were fairly accurate. Even the heart rate was accurate to the beat if 2-3 beats per minute. I tested in resting conditions, after exercise, ( where the HRV is minimal, so stress is maximum) and Samsung Health stress results and this app results match perfectly.",
            "This app's heart rate is pretty accurate, but the stress level is just useless. Even if I measure in the middle of a severe panic attack, it says I have low stress. Half the app is in English, half is some Asian language. Not recommended for stress measurement",
            "The ability to use camera for heart rate is very innovative. The app checks the variance of the heart rate from the median and has some predefined set of calculations to get the percentage. This may not be accurate way to calculate mental stress, but the condition of the heart. However, the bpm shown is perfect. So 4 stars, but 1 star less because the stress percentage is not always accurate. It shows different values when taken one after another for me.",

Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

            "Mostly not too special, but there are a few good games that I haven't seen in similar relaxation apps. \"Galaxy\" is one. As for \"common\" anti-stress games, this app has the best slime simulator! (The mud/clay is my favorite.)",
            "Ok I just installed it, not so bad. I actually really enjoy some of these cute games, but I did not try them all yet. I tried the stretch one, and I was not so impressed with that one, I expected I could really stretch it not just move the hands. The butter one, was not actual butter, it was just bubbles you press on. Sometimes the game is not responding to my touches. If you add more games and fix these mistakes in your game, it will be a lot better. :)",
            "This is supposed to be a game that relieves stress. Not increase it. I feel like I can't ever relax with this game without having to be shown an ad. People look these kind of games to calm down, not to be hounded with ads. Please fix this, and I'll be more than happy to give you five stars.",
            "This makes me rage more because of all the fricking ads, I would rate it 4 stars if it hadn't had so many ads."

Thank you.",

What you do know is that you want to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSo where do you begin?\r\n\r\nEnter the world of MoodSpace\r\nMoodSpace brings together techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, positive psychology, and behavioural activation into a self-help space for mental wellbeing to guide you in managing and improving your mental health.\r\nTechniques such as recognising three good things in a gratitude journal and balancing automatic thoughts in the cbt thought record are grounded in decades of research on what makes us happy.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds \r\nNotice life's good moments by writing a delightful three good things in a gratitude journal and note the good things that are all too often forgotten.\r\n\r\nThree Clouds is based on the gratitude journal from Positive Psychotherapy. By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.\r\n\r\nThought Diary \r\nLook at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.\r\n\r\nThe thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.\r\n\r\nGuided Meditation\r\nFocus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds.

Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced. I try to fill the three clouds when I remember, but I'm not yet regular with it. The Thought Diary function was immensely helpful in a difficult situation. Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",

It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking.

Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them.

This app has no tracker or graph as standard, they want you to pay. Even samsung health comes with free tracker for steps etc. I need a visual to help me assess and so this app and every other Anxiety app I've tried fail as nobody does the tracker for free.",

Disrupting the flow of gameplay, much like the flow of electricity, is a big no-no if you want player retention and don't want to be labeled as a cash grabber. Normally I wouldn't mind ads, but the frequency is too damn high.",
            "I love this so much! I found it when I was just scrolling through the play store (something I do a lot of when I'm feeling restless) I found this and thought, why not. I'm absolutely in love with it and it gives me just enough of something to focus on to really help me stay calm when I start feeling uncomfortable or anxious. Thank you so much for this, really. Your amazing people.",
            "This game is so fun! It reminds me of when I was a kid and played games like this where you had to connect the energy source to the lightbulb, so the nostalgia helps make this game super fun and enjoyable. The controls work great, I love the noises the game makes, the music's maybe a bit too ethereal, and I wouldn't say it gives me a sense of de-stressing yet, but overall it's very enjoyable. Great job to the two developers who made it!",
            "I was really enjoying this game. It was fun, relaxing and required a little bit of thought and had originally gave it a review of 4 stars, but after playing 10 levels I am now dropping it to 1 star and plan on uninstalling as after each level is completed I have to watch a video (and not just a 30 second video either). I'm guessing this is why you are prompted to review at level 10 and not 11 onwards. If you can get past this I'd recommend the game but sadly it's not for me. Many reviews concur."

I don't know who's voice that is but it's so soothing and makes me unwind instantly! Don't change a thing! Thank you to the creators of this app. It's been a God send for my healing from anxiety.",
            "I've been on a severe anxiety attack that went on for 3 days. I was considering hypnosis through a consultant but stumbled upon this app. I paid the extra $$ to move the hypno sound all the way up and to put it on loop so it can play while I'm asleep. After the 1st night of listening my anxiety attack was 70% gone. 2nd night no anxiety. I've downloaded a couple of other hypnosis apps, self esteem, fear and exercise. *UPDATE* It'd be great if I could play all of the apps i unlocked while I sleep",
            "Free yet not free. Although it said the app was free, once you try it, you discover many features are not available until you upgrade to a paid version, never mentioned on the download page. It was impossible to evaluate with so many features unusable.",
            "This had become 1 of my go-to apps at the end of the day. If you don't over expect any sudden results. I just allow it to give me at least 30 min of mindfulness. When used at night I do find I sleep better.",

            "This app is absolutely one of the most satisfying and beautifully interactive works of art I've ever seen. Each different display interacts with your touch differently, and often in ways you wouldn't expect. So pleasing and calming, and the ad breaks are much more reasonably paced. I'd rather it higher if I could, and I thank the creator(s) and anyone involved in the production of this wonderful app.",
            "Great app for relaxing. I love being able to listen to the soothing music and playing around with the different configurations. Ads aren't too frequent or overly annoying, although I would prefer a paid option and hope the developer creates one. Also, I'd like for there to be multicolor options in the future. Otherwise, fantastic work - highly recommend trying this one out if you need some stress relief!",
            "Love it, but is there no way to pay for an ad-free version? Also, it'd be nice if it would cycle back to the beginning when you reach the end. And is the one that says tangle messed up? The bottom of the letter g looks like it got cut off, or is the letter in a different font. Still love the app and highly recommend it for anyone looking to de-stress... Reply to dev: Awesome and thanks for the quick replies! Edit:this is just an redo of my review from a year ago. You said the same thing then. :/",
            "The app is great.it is just so satisfiying .but my problem is that there are not that many levels. Yes some people will think that I am mad because there are many levels but when you get to the end you will also think that it's not that many levels . So please add more levels and if we ignore it the app is so fun and great . Thanks for making such a fun app but please add more levels.Thanks",
            "I appreciate the calm this app gives me. Very mesmerizing. You should be able to set this up like light therapy. With some very nice background music. Maybe a clock on top. So nice music, a clock/day,date, random scrolling, playlist kind of thing with creators effects...all perfect for your phone on the nightstand on its kickstand, right? I know, I'm asking alot, I wish I could write code. Thanks for listening"

            "Huge battery drain on my phone, but runs ok on a tablet. Has several kinds of in-game currencies, all of which are easy to earn by in-game actions or short ads. In-game upgrades mostly lead to better in-game earnings, some of which from more frequent in-game actions, so be careful if you don't like having to tap on a \"soothing\" game too often. Some menus are too small to read on an 8-inch tablet, so it would be nice if the app offered a setting option for larger menu font.",
            "Absolutly beautiful! Its entertaining but not too demanding and is a great game to create goals with. For example, after this assignment I'll check on the island! Tons of animals to unlock that aren't ridiculously expensive. I personally won't be investing too much money on this, but it's great for those who want to devote a lot of attention to the app! Cute music and adorable style. Adds are options and shown before hand, so you get the feeling of \"just for you!\" Overall 10/10 Great work! (@v@)",
            "Good concept too many paywalls. I love the idea of this game, but like so many games like it the game is so limiting at the beginning that I loose interest. I want to customize my island not spend hours tapping hearts and doing other stuff before I can even do any meaningful customization. Had the same issue with rollercoasters tycoon, sim city and other building app games. Not fun when 90% of the game is locked.",
            "I don't really review on games, it's not my thing but This game here is itself legendary! It got me hooked as soon as I started playing it, it's so calming and relaxing like all your sadness will go away by just playing this game for 4-5 minutes.. it's amazing!! I highly recommend it to everyBODY out there to try this out, you won't regret it! üíú",
            "I absolutely LOVE the new updates! Great idle app. Just when I thought I was about to \"beat the game,\" I found out there are more things to do and \"quests\" to achieve. Thank you! üíØüíØüíØ P.S. Investing in some of the packages/offers/bundles is COMPELTELY worth it!!"

            "Occam's Razor - I am glad to see they stripped most of the fancy unnecessary features. You can take a session with a trainer as a guest. Awsome! But, for new users, it is not very clear how they should proceed. Unless they take Master Clases they wouldn't understand what to do. I suggest the app should play the audio guided-meditation steps when we request for a sitting with a trainer. Of course, they should be able to check a box to skip it. --- Earlier Review --- Very convenient to request for remote meditation sessions with a trainer. Awesome. Now a days, not many apps provide support phone numbers and email addresses. This app offers the same. Checkout Profile->Settings->Help.",
            "Very Useful to take Remote Meditation session. Previous Taken Sittings with Dates not available, please provide. In previous Apps - Details about Prefect Name with photos was there. Please add that.",
            "This system made me realise the objective of my existence. The application is super easy to use and understand. You just need a Heart to experience. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!",
            "Real time.. please add the feature whether beginner or existing in the main menu.",

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

            "As such there is no issues but some glitches i own more than 20 maps but the game says that i only own 1 and the skins the game has ate awesome but if u apply it on some particuler weapon it looks very weird.At the end the game has a large variety of awesome wepons to chose from .",
            "This is such, and STILL a great game. The reason for this is airplane mode. This gets rid of all ads an snakes gameplay less laggy. The huge selection of guns and weapons is pretty good. The bosses are nice, and everything in it is amazingly incredible. Overall I made this page to tell you to use airplane mode and get the creator more positive reviews. But still get rid of some ads. Thank you. üòâ",
            "I love this game a lot but when I beaten the bosses in the first ten maps then relaunch the app when I come off it, some of the bosses reset for no reason and I have to keep beating them up again and again. These bosses that reset are on map three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. Can you fix this bug please. P. S. Thank you for changing all of the bosses into humans again.",
            "Its so sad that this game sold out. Used to be an amazing game. Now there are UNSKIPPABLE ADs everywhere. It was one of my favourite games, and is now awful to endure. When the option pops up to watch an add to \"double the reward\" whether you choose to double it or not you will STILL have to watch an add as it plays automatically regardless of the button you press. Some of these ads even have a function where they reroute you out of the app and straight to the googleplay download page. Awful",
            "The game was fun at first until it started lagging and glitching out on me. The screen goes black every five minutes and sometimes the boss will disappear from the screen completely making me restart the app. And if there's more than ten maps it won't let me scroll through the rest of them. It only shows maps 1 through 10."

        "recentChanges": "Thanks for using Calm! This update contains multiple bug fixes and performance improvements. As always, you can expect an original Daily Calm every day, new music and Sleep Stories every week, and new Meditation programs every month.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Hello, Thank You for this awesome game. I play it for hours each day. But I will have to uninstall the game. This game SRCH uses up my Moto G6 play battery, under app info I even restricted background usage of data and restricted background battery. No of this helps. I just played the game for 1 hour and 47 mins and your game used 7% of my battery. Out of 45 games this game uses most. Any suggestions to prevent your game from using so much battery .",
            "This was great until it RIPPED ME OFF !!!! üò°üò° . I had 2 of the feature that you tap it and it fills in all of that shape . So the first 2 times that I tried , nothing happened . On the thurd try it filled in all of the turnips . When I tried to use the second one , it did not work , it only colored one hot pepper BUT NOT ALL . BUT it showed I had used the second one , no more of that feature was left and that if I wanted more I had to watch an ad !! üò° Give that back , I will give 5üåü .",
            "I don't know what's going on. But the app won't get passed the first page all it does is shows the red bar almost done loading to get to the page with the puzzle but it won't get passed that page. Pisses me off. I really like this game, I have Moto g stylus. Can you please fix this problem. Update still won't get passed the loading screen. Smh. Even when I have Wi-Fi. I'm so bummed I love playing this game. . guess I'm stuck to find a another game. Bummer. May you guy Guys can make more.",
            "The game is a lot of fun but it lags badly, says that a puzzle is unfinished when it clearly is, freezes and doesn't let you pick another puzzle unless you go out and come back in and sometimes in the middle of a puzzle all the uncolored pieces disappear and you have to leave and come back in to finish it.",
            "I did give this game 5 stars. I have to drop it down because before they fixed the non existing bugs, it worked perfectly. It would work alot faster if you could pay to have the ads removed. That's not an option yet (hint hint). But now the auto focus goes in and out at random times. Instead of just being able to click on the little picture. I now have to tap it up it 5 times. Then i give up and look for another one. How can I uninstall your new \"fix\" so I can have the original game back?"

            "This app is quiet helpful. At first when I tried the app I wasnt taking it seriously but when I opened up to it to see if it would help it has helped me a bit. I have really bad anxiety, generalized/health anxiety and majority of the time I forget to get on the app but when I do I feel more relieved and have my thoughts more collected than out of control all over the place. I dont pay the app for special exercises or anything and it good.",
            "They say the free version has several exercises, but when I entered my mood info, a message said, 'you aren't having negative thoughts so try one of our many activities.' But ALL activities were locked. And ALL 'Guides' were locked. There were no exercises for me to use. How can I decide to go Premium if I can't try anything in the free version first? I don't like giving low ratings before contacting the developer first - but I could not find any contact info anywhere - another pet peeve.",
            "It's not accurate to say you have a choice of exercises. Unless you pay, you get one exercise, whether it's one you like or not. The exercises are nice, but this app has nothing BUT its 11 exercises, and charges as much as apps with a whole library of meditations and tools. It's enjoyable to use but they are asking a ridiculous price for so little content compared to the competitors.",
            "I got mind ease early and was gifted a full subscription! I really enjoy the full experience and It has helped me manage my anxiety really well. The calm me function is really cool and helps give you an experience tailored to what you're feeling without you having to pick it in your moment of panic which is a great feature. I hope by this time next year I will financially be able to continue my subscription because it is well worth the money imo!",
            "I was halfway through the very first pre exercise and I felt so much better. Towards the end I had a slight emotional release, which was very much needed and I am still genuinely surprised. I cannot wait to dive deeper into this app. Thank you so much for creating this, it is truly going to help a lot of people!"

            "It's a great app even before going pro (which in my case is not needed. I try to use it once a day just to help me control my breath while meditating. Strongly recommended.",
            "I like this app a lot but it's not fully developed. I would not invest in the premium version yet as the free version has plenty of glitches. I find it helpful and I think it has a great Foundation to be a frontrunner. I specifically like the breathing bar although only comes with premium. I like being able to change the colors making it easier on my eyes and less stressful to use. I also like the defined breathing exercises for Sleep stress COPD excetera. But the app needs work.",
            "Awesome customisable app,only thing missing is dark mode and import own background sounds in case one doesn't like the ones there/for variety.Maybe the white screen should have some pastel colours with shades changing as the ball moves? Upon completion of a longer time maybe an encouraging message like \"well done or you've improved \" to encourage people to return to the app? So good I recommended it to a friend who enjoys it :D thank you so much makers of this app !!üòä No account needed,yay !",
            "This app has potential, but presently has annoying glitches: 1) has several audible glitches in the audio (inhale and exhale cues), 2) no delayed start is available, 3) always asks confirmation before exiting (it should not do this unkess you are in the middle of a session. It should also provide the option to turn this confirmation off.)",
            "Visual of ball and adjustment of timing is great. But the audio glitches that make a crackling sound every time the audio cue happens makes this app unusable with the sound on. Yes, you can just turn the audio guide off, but the audio guide, without the glitches, would really add to the meditative experience and would allow you to not have to be looking at the ball 100% of the time."

I definitely recommend this game for people who have a lot of stress like I used too. Thank you for this game. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ",

            "I love slime so it's really satisfying for me and I love squishies so it's really good game that you came up with and it's just so satisfying it's the best game in the world but I prefer super slime simulator if you made a game where you make slime with all the ingredients activator shaving foam colour glue it would be amazing and that would be my top favourite game",
            "Not that good because there are a limeted amount of squishies and they don't act like the real thing. My advice is to go and buy a squishy instead of this game. Also there are ads everywhere and it makes me more stressed than I did before.",
            "It's really easy. But maybe you can make it so like you can get different toys easier without watching a video.. Otherwise it's pretty good, 4 stars until u make some of the toys free."

Every single cycle of deep breathing sends a message to the brain to calm down and relax. When we are engulfing by STRESS, heart rate will increase but if we breath deeply, we are relaxing.\r\n\r\nWhy using video to guide the deep breathing?\r\nThe video shows a flower with appearing of petals (breathing in) and disappearing of petals (breathing out) to aid or accompany one's to do the deep breathing. According to the research study, the suggested deep breathing for 6 full cycle in one minutes is recommended to avoid hyperventilation. Here, the video with appropriate timing for deep breathing is guided. With a wander mind, guided object can help to let us stay focus on it and feeling relax in short duration. User may just observe the appearing and disappearing petals of the smiling flower.\r\n\r\nWhat is heart rate variability (HRV) and why do user is encouraged to do the measurement for before and after the deep breathing training ?\r\nHeart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is a non invasive tool in stress management with deep breathing. With this app, user needs not to purchase external HRV device to do measurement. You can focus on two aspects, \r\n1. HRV measurement reliability and repeatability.\r\n2. HRV baseline values.\r\n\r\nUser may use the HRV baseline values (before training) to compare with the result after deep breathing training. HRV baseline values is relevant in the context of longitudinal changes and comparisons. You need to have a higher HRV, which reflecting your heart achieving a more time constant heart beat rhythm. Anyhow, deeper breaths increase your HRV. This app is enabling user to monitor their HRV reading daily to reduce stress with the guided deep breathing video.Reducing stress can improve people's health according to research study.\r\n\r\nSupport: Up to Android Kit Kat 4.4 and above\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n\r\n1. Registration for new user\r\n2. Login with registered user\r\n3. Select option on answering the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure the perception of stress.\r\n   a.

        "description": "Never go to bed with stress again.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors had lot of time on their hands and have left behind so many simple yet powerful techniques for us. We just need to follow their footsteps and not try and attempt to re-invent their cycle. I fell into that fast-paced lifestyle and destroyed my health. Diagnosed with diabetes at 32 years old, I had a heart attack due to work related stress. Thats when I decided enough is enough and I need to transform from the inside out. 3 years of intense research and experiments in Yoga led me to these routines which gave my body a chance to repair and reverse all my health issues. I have reversed my diabetes, strengthened my heart and rid my body of medications. When I look back, I remember the stressed and harmful lifestyle I was living and the diseases it created. \r\nI took Yoga teacher certification and Pranayama Teacher certification from classical gurus (Old-School). \r\n\r\nI am now on a mission to help people get rid of lifestyle diseases, stress and medications. What I am sharing in this app is my daily routine and the fundamentals I practice every day. Stress is the silent killer of our time - leading to heart attacks and preventing us from achieving our health goals thereby triggering even more diseases. A 40-year-old getting heart attacks is becoming common.\r\n\r\nGet rid of unwanted stress and get complete control of your body. Never go to bed again with stress and suppression.\r\n\r\n1. Prevent Back Pain ‚Äì With countless hours of sitting all day we mess up the natural alignment of our back. This simple routine will help fix the weak areas around the spine and neck and puts back the Spine discs in the natural socket. It will fix your back pain and will be helpful to make you sit straight for Meditation. Studies show that 80+ million Americans are suffering from some form of\r\nback & spine related issues.\r\n\r\n2. Release Stress in Upper Back & Neck - Text neck is now a common problem because of regular use of smartphones. Doing these routines will alleviate stress in the upper back and neck and practicing this exercise regularly can help avoid major issues. This chapter will prepare you for the next chapter where you will learn of how to breathe correctly.\r\n\r\n3.

        "descriptionHTML": "Never go to bed with stress again.<br><br>Our ancestors had lot of time on their hands and have left behind so many simple yet powerful techniques for us. We just need to follow their footsteps and not try and attempt to re-invent their cycle. I fell into that fast-paced lifestyle and destroyed my health. Diagnosed with diabetes at 32 years old, I had a heart attack due to work related stress. Thats when I decided enough is enough and I need to transform from the inside out. 3 years of intense research and experiments in Yoga led me to these routines which gave my body a chance to repair and reverse all my health issues. I have reversed my diabetes, strengthened my heart and rid my body of medications. When I look back, I remember the stressed and harmful lifestyle I was living and the diseases it created. <br>I took Yoga teacher certification and Pranayama Teacher certification from classical gurus (Old-School). <br><br>I am now on a mission to help people get rid of lifestyle diseases, stress and medications. What I am sharing in this app is my daily routine and the fundamentals I practice every day. Stress is the silent killer of our time - leading to heart attacks and preventing us from achieving our health goals thereby triggering even more diseases. A 40-year-old getting heart attacks is becoming common.<br><br>Get rid of unwanted stress and get complete control of your body. Never go to bed again with stress and suppression.<br><br>1.

These are all great practical applications, because the app allows one to see what actual state of stress they are in and make moves to relax either with breathing exercises/meditating or other means. The app has also useful for spiritual growth. It can strongly supplement prayer/meditation.",

Its helped me be able to practice breathing techniques without the app.",

I know you can't die from panic attacks but it sure does feel like it, and this app did an amazing job on helping me with me breathing! I don't know what else to say! If anyone is looking for a good app to help you through your panic attacks, this is the app! Again, thanks so much for this app! You're an amazing human being for making this app",
            "I just used this app for the first time and it's absolutely fantastic! I have anxiety and am trying to work on my breathing. My son and daughter have Aspergers syndrome and I am going to suggest it for them too. Because it's so visual...I feel positive that it will work to calm them too. Thank you so much.",
            "I'd like a longer or different one. i think a few more selections make it easy to know which exercise to use for the proper moment. each attack is different at times. it started to work but the short length for me was the only downfall. i will keep it and see how it progresses."

Only thing to say is wish for some more shades of colours, but there are already lots there, just me being picky!",

I WANT to like this app. It is a great concept but has needs in the quality aspect of the app. It needs less ads and the enlarging process causes lag and then once enlarged the pic moves too quickly and causes more glitching. For a stress relieving app it causes more stress dealing with the glitches and ads than it relieves. This app has promise if fixed. Keeping for now in hopes...",

More problems: after the above, I've tried to use the Back Arrow: Doesn't Work; had to use the Back Button on my cellphone in order to Return to the same place Initially to Select a picture & the Same thing happened over & over again & again.

        "description": "Clear your mind from anxiety and stress, leaving you free to enjoy a healthier life!\r\n\r\nThe app was developed based on 20 years of tried and tested behavioural change work in private practice helping many people with a unique method. Interrupting the connection between your negative emotional memories and your brain, clearing your mind and leaving you feeling much better. \r\n\r\nUsing advanced eye tracking technology, this unique method is now brought right to your mobile device.\r\n\r\nYour brain is being triggered by emotional memories hidden inside your mind, that‚Äôs why your problem has been so difficult to diagnose, because it‚Äòs real, you haven‚Äôt made it up.

            "Its unfortunate that they dont advertise the Student discount. $9.99/year is astoundingly generous of them. Thanks! But I dont think anyone knows about this deal. I only learned about this when I accidentally stumbled across a YouTube comment from a year ago. Awesome app, great stuff for sleep. It do be crashing though. Just recently, so idk if it's just me or everyone else got the same problem?",
            "This app was brilliant when I first started using it every day - especially during lockdown - but now that Headspace Plus is a thing, it's way too expensive to access to the soundscapes & meditations that I was using before. The selection available now, without Headspace Plus, is shockingly little especially considering I am already paying for the app! I liked a nice mix of things to help me sleep but now I can only listen to the same three things on rotation which isn't great. Not happy at all.",
            "My 5-year old and I saw a commercial for this app which featured a cute animated video of a \"robot\" slowly shutting down its systems in advance of falling asleep. I thought this would be a great app for my kid to watch while doing bedtime, so I signed up for a (pretty pricey) subscription. Immediately was disappointed by the fact that no such cutesy videos are ACTUALLY part of the app (most of it appears to consist of streaming audio). Feels a bit like false advertising...",
            "I only use this app for the Sleepcasts, they're very peaceful to listen to and I usually fall asleep after the first 15 minutes or so. A few months ago they offered 3 to listen to for free, but now they only offer 1, and all of the others are behind a pretty high pay wall - its incredibly frustrating, especially during this time and all the stressful things everyone is going through in their lives",
            "Just updated the app for the first time in around a year. The new organization of meditation options is awful. Examples: you have a lot of activity-specific meditations, but the only way to access them is to remember what they're called and search. Also, i don't want to have to scroll forever, past lots of meditations that I'll never be choosing (e.g., kids), just to see what's available. Alphabetical organization of every option is tedious and difficult to get through."

Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "We used to love this app. When we got it in February there were enough free tracks to make it useable. When covid came the whole thing was free. It was a lovely bonus. But now there is only 1 free track in each of the meditation sections. They are the shortest ones. It's v disappointing. We looked at buying the app but it is way too expensive. The amount being charged is what I would expect to pay for a year, not a month. Tbh it feels quite money grabbing.....not in the spirit of well being",
            "Update: Ninja Focus kindly opened up a bunch of the content for an extended period. We are back to happily using it for the time being. Thank you Ninja Focus! Loved until the update. Our 6 month trial ran out or something, now so much of it is locked. We do use it every night and my son absolutely loves falling asleep listening to the stories and music. I am now looking for a free app, as this one is expensive to purchase a membership.",
            "I was unimpressed when the update came out and the app came with a monthly fee. After speaking with the app developers they have listened to my concerns and respond really reasonably. The app is a great ground to open up conversations about emotions and thoughts with my son's. We love it as a family and I hope we can continue to use in the future.",
            "Originally, this app was wonderful. I used it every night and always had great sleeps, I gave it 5 stars! Since this update however, It takes about 20 taps for me to select something and the app constantly crashes. Reading other reviews I found that I wasn't the only one with this issue! What has happened? Is there any way to fix it???",
            "What a bummer used and loved for my son's now updated and I have to pay. As a single mother of two boys who is currently employed part time due to covid and everything else with school and education happening at home this AP was a respite and a way to connect and slow down with my son's teaching them and watching grow through mindfulness. Did the upgrade and now all of their favorite meditations and yoga are locked unless I but As we are unsure of our meals for the week I can not"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

Stress is mental tension caused by demanding, taxing or burdensome circumstances. Stress doesn't just affect our mental state and mood; it affects our physical health as well. When we are very stressed, a hormone called cortisol is released into our bloodstream, suppressing the functioning of our immune, digestive and reproductive systems.

Stress is actually a survival response when our body thinks that it is in danger. That is why our sympathetic nervous system kicks in and makes our heart rate increase and gives us a burst of the energy hormone, adrenaline, so that we can deal with whatever situation is being thrown at us. This is also called our flight or fight response.\r\n\r\nThe problem is when we deal with constant stress and worry, or when we don't know how to properly manage a stressful situation.

            "This has been a great app, it's especially useful when you're having an anxiety attack and you can't help yourself or have anyone to go to. Even if things escalate (suicidal ideation, self-harm etc) it still provides help and resources.",
            "I have a VERY HIGH stress level.This app helps with calming my anxiety,looking at things in a more positive light,and is just THE BEST all around app that is FREE and HELPFUL.TRY IT-you'll love it,too!!!",
            "De-stress Me is a mental well-being app based on cognitive-behavioral (CBT) techniques. I am currently a graduate student in psychology, and as such, I used this app with a discerning eye. The first time I opened the app I was greeted by a rather minimal interface with several options on the bottom of the screen, and a big de-stressMe button in the center. The options along the bottom allow you to input information including your strengths, ways to give thanks, and self-care ideas. The information that you input is used when you activate the de-stressing tool. One of the primary components of CBT is cognitive restructuring which entails challenging negative and automatic thoughts. The app cleverly integrates the information that you input into the bottom menus in order to assist you in challenging negatively oriented thoughts that you may experience during times of stress. Additionally, the app may suggest a technique that I am familiar with from my training, diaphragmatic breathing. The app does a good job of teaching and applying the basic tenants of both strategies. Overall, the app was helpful in reducing my stress and is based on sound psychological principles. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to reduce stress in their life.",
            "Lovely, well designed and effective app. A must for those prone to stress and anxiety. Particularly love the images of progressing up a mountain in de-stress mode.",
            "This app is really helping me! It seems simple but is highly effective the more a person practices with it. I'm glad this app is available and is free!"

            "There is way to many adds. This game has the most adds iv'e ever seen in a game. And it's supposed to be a stress reliver. But the games are cool even though when i played one (mini) game i had two 30 second ads. So its really not that good of a game like you dont need adds to make it a good game that actually makes it worse.",
            "Lots of exciting games on the app lots of noises too I enjoyed playing on it however my stress and satisfaction levels are completely different in bad ways although lots of levels to not get bored on and too many ads. In addition to that, I recommend it for your own children and I love the fact you can choose different colours and angles of which you see it also if you download enjoy all of the extra apps inside that it recommends overall way too many ads",
            "Too many advertisements. Best way to stop getting pestered by watching advertisements is to get out of the game, then select back onto the game and the ad should be gone. Most applications this trick works with to help stop watching ads",
            "Well I rate this game a five star because I mean I haven't played it yet but I think that it is still an awesome game because well I have read what other people think about this gnae and they all said like 3 or 2 rating of stars and that's cool and all but I think that this age e is awesome because there is some really good sounding of noises that you will hear so I think that there is li,e slime and crunchy stuff like you know slime like i said already what ever and like drinks sound cool as we",
            "I DO NOT recommend this app. It isn't worth your time!! When I first pressed the app, it had a whole selection of stress-relieveing sections and I was looking forward to trying them out. As soon as I press one, an ad pops up! (Happens for every one!) And they don't even work well. Most of the satisfying stuff is laggy and not accurate to the real comparison. Do not waste your time!!"

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",

I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "This is a really fantastic breathing app. It is intuitive to use, has a range of common preprogrammed exercise but it is also extremely easy to create and customise your own. An added bonus is the lack of intrusive ads. If there is a better free breathing app I would be really surprised.",
            "Wow! Truly an awesome app. I can customize inhale, hold, exhale, hold to 10th of sec. App calculates breaths per minute. I can set total time for a session. Audio cues mean I can breathe with my eyes closed. All of these can be saved to my own custom sessions. The added bonus is the ability to set notifications during the day to remind myself it's time to do a session. Great app!",
            "It's rare that I will give something a positive rating after a mere two days but I am experiencing here with this program is amazing! I have done breathing exercises on my own and under guidance with varying degrees of positive results but this app is (even compared to a teacher's instruction) head and shoulders above everything else! Simple UI, voice and visual guidance, great programs that you can easily dedicate daily practice to...it's just great!",
            "This is a great app for it lets you customized your own breathing program of inhales and exhales in decimal second increments. It also has a timer for how many minutes you want to do the breathing. I really wish they had a better choice for the beginning and end sound beside that loud gong noise for it is distracting after being relaxed from the meditative breathing. That is why the 4 rating.",
            "An excellent app. Specifically because the custom timer allows for tenth of a second adjustments which allows me to set 5.5 second breaths for optimum resonant breathing sessions. I would give 5 stars were I able to set my own colours on the visualiser and change the jarring bell sound to something more muted and soft. This is an app I will use every day."

Also if the timer could've been in multiples of 5 minutes it'd have been better :)",

Go easy on us at least a little, not everyone's good at everything",

The start button is unresponsive and when I have been able to get past the opening screen, clicking on the skill game or menu icon does nothing so I literally couldn't interact with this app. Waste of time. Uninstalling/reinstalling didn't help.",

I've tried them all, back to the days of Android KitKat, but for years there's only been *one* that I've found interesting enough to use. I'VE FINALLY FOUND ANOTHER! This is one of the most unique fluid sims I've ever tried. I absolutely love having such a completely different toolkit with which to control the sim. Very well done; my thanks and congrats go to the dev.",
            "*Update* Thank you d ev for keeping up with this app. Though it was a small purchase I am more than humbled by your level of care for this app. Again thank you. *Update* This is a staple on my phone now. My five year old loves it. No other game or app gets him this focused. He spends more time on this than any other game I have for him. Best part is I don't feel as guilty if I let him play longer than normal.",
            "Fantastic, beautiful, and great for toddlers! The only problem is that there's no reset to defaults options,so once you mess up the settings you're on your own to fix them. The \"default\" profile is no help since it gets overwritten. Should be easy to fix for the developer though",
            "Mesmerizing and gorgeous. I've never been so captivated by an app before, especially one that doesn't do much functionally. It is now set as my wallpaper. Love that it's part of Play Pass!",
            "I just buy new phone, and for now this app not working bc \"buy a game to continue\" error. I'm already did it, just on previous phone. 2 stars for now, waiting for fix."

Let the timer and audio cues guide the rhythm of your breath as you breathe in and breathe out, inhaling the future and exhaling the past.\r\n\r\nPranayama (\"prana\" - life force, \"yama\" - regulation) is the conscious regulation & awareness of breath: the life force that both energizes and relaxes the body. It is no surprise that our breath can influence our physiology. Wim Hof, a Dutch extreme athlete, is noted for his ability to withstand freezing temperatures thanks to his breathwork. \r\n\r\nEven if you are not aiming to become an extreme athlete, you can enjoy the many benefits of breathwork such as strengthening your immune system (which can be confirmed by measuring your heart rate variability, a.k.a., HRV), improving your ability to deal with stress & anxiety, keeping asthma under control, etc.. In fact, you will notice an immediate sense of relaxation through a short minute of breathwork.\r\n\r\nDeep breathing doesn't help. What helps is rhythm.

Love that there are daily reminders, it helps cut through everyday distractions. But it should definitely be customizable, not fixed. Also, some sort of progress bar to visually complement the countdown would be nice and help me stay focused. PS. Kudos to the dev for being receptive & swift to act on feedback!",

The app seems a wee bit clunky, but that's alright as it's a new app as of writi this review. We all need some meditation app. This a good one, a one time fee is great.",

Once I downloaded it i was actuly shocked. you can only tap on the ball about 20 times till you have. to watch an add in order to tap it more. such a cash grab. It looks lazy, and is really boring. Save your time and don't download this.",
            "Its an ok game would love some more features on it though like adding different stress iteams like the fidget cube or spinner and maybe even glitter stress balls and maybe no charge ups coz i cant destess with this beeing limited squeezes of the stress ball even when im carm i squish it like over 20 times and when angry more then 30 times now im having to wait another day and a half just to get the last feature wich has 40 times of squish. If upgrades are done then ill give more of a good rating",
            "It's bad. All you do I press it and it inflates. You only get like 30-40 charges which means the amount you can press it. All you do it touch it and those things come out of the net. Time consuming to wait and very boring.",
            "This is a stupid app because why do i have to watch ads just to only use the thing a couple times! And another thing i should get to use the thing whenever i want and this app just got me more stressed. I does not even let me do the last one until 2 DAYS!!! üò°",

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ‚òπÔ∏è I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "Very good therapist Zeel. It's helped me a lot. Thanks.I loved the app, it has quite a few simple but useful features. I am using anxiety program. It has helped me understand my anxiety in a simple way. Still halfway to go but it's quite helpful.",
            "Wonderful app. It has large catelog of exercises and activities. My counselor was Mrs. Madhavi Adhvaryu who really helped me to control my anxiety and develop positive attitude in life.",
            "Nice app. The counselor I got I.e Madhavi Adhvaryu is very good and supporting. But there is problem with the speed of the app.",
            "I had really high hopes for this app but i get an error every single time i try to load the introduction video. If this can be fixed then i'll change my star rating. Some other functions work and some dont. Please please fix!!!",
            "The experience has been good, as soon as I got into the app, for a much lower price then many counsellors you can have no limited chat and with a fee, which I didn't use can place phone meeting half an hour each. It's nice because you can switch between counsellors if you're not feeling satisfied and there are in the counselling section some guided exercises and articles for several purposes. Note that the price differs between therapy and program, being in this way affordable for more people."

        "description": "Hi, I'm Zilla. Your fiery friend for a better, longer life. We're building your one app for Healthy Habits. Use the app to measure your Heart Rate and HRV, track your Stress & Recovery, and build Healthy Habits like Intermittent Fasting, Breathing Exercise, and Mindfulness Meditation.\r\n\r\nCAMERA HEART RATE MONITOR, NO WEARABLE NEEDED!\r\nHealthzilla can now monitor your Resting Heart Rate (\"RHR\") and Heart Rate Variability (\"HRV\") using your phone's camera. It takes just 60 seconds, and will measure your RHR (heart health) and HRV (stress & recovery) just like a wearable device. Do the Stress Scan every morning before getting out of bed for best results!\r\n\r\nNEW: 16-HOUR INTERMITTENT FASTING TIMER\r\nThe latest health & fitness trend is Intermittent Fasting. Use our free fasting timer to fit the ideal 16:8 fast into your day. We'll notify you once you can eat again! If you forget to set the timer in the evening, you can edit the start time to capture your fast.\r\n\r\nNEW: 10-MINUTE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION TIMER\r\nThe easiest way to fit some mindfulness meditation into your day is to use our unguided meditation timer, with beautiful Tibetan gongs to help you stay focused on your meditation.\r\n\r\nNEW: 2-MINUTE RELAXING BREATHING EXERCISE\r\nIf you're feeling anxious or stressed out, take just two minutes to try our Breathing Exercise. The 1:2 ratio of inhale to exhale will activate your parasympathetic nervous system to calm you down instantly!\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR STRESS & RECOVERY TRENDS\r\nThe dashboard shows a weekly chart of your Heart Rate and HRV data. If your Heart Rate is HIGHER than normal, it may be an indicator of higher physiological or psychological stress. Similarly, if your HRV is much lower than normal, it will indicate higher stress levels. You can use this information to guide your recovery from workouts, and generally planning your daily activities at work. For active recovery, you can also focus on sleep or add meditation and breathing exercises.\r\n\r\nDAILY STRESS SCORE\r\nAfter each Stress Scan, we calculate your Stress Score based on recent trends: Great, Good, Easy, Rest, or Sick. Use this as a guide for your daily wellness routines, activities, and workouts.\r\n\r\nANOMALY DETECTION\r\nTo help you make sense of this data, our Stress Score algorithm checks for unusually high or low values for your heart rate. Very low HRV or very high Heart Rate can be signs of acute stress, injury, or illness.\r\n\r\nFEELING UNWELL?\r\nYou can now manually override your daily Stress Score, if you're feeling stressed or unwell. You can access the override from the dashboard, or after your daily Stress Scan.\r\n\r\nRESTING HEART RATE (‚ÄúRHR‚Äù)\r\nThis data is much more important than your real-time heart rate. What‚Äôs the difference? Heart Rate represents how much work your heart has to do when you‚Äôre relaxed. It‚Äôs not exactly the same as the lowest heart rate you have when you sleep.\r\n\r\nThe reason resting heart rate is important is that it‚Äôs a rough measure of your nervous system activity, hormone levels, and cardiovascular fitness. There is research to show that lower resting heart rate means longer life.\r\n\r\nHEART RATE VARIABILITY (‚ÄúHRV‚Äù)\r\nOkay, so we know heart rate is your pulse. How many times the heart beats per minute. So what is this voodoo, then? Well, it turns out that the beats per minute aren‚Äôt steady. There‚Äôs a minute variation between each one. Some shorter, some longer.\r\n\r\nThis is some of the most interesting new data out there, because HRV is actually a representation of your central nervous system. If you‚Äôre not exactly sure what that is, it‚Äôs basically your wiring. How signals pass between your brain and the rest of your body. Analyzing this signal indicates if your body is in fight or flight mode, or rest and digest mode. Naturally, you wouldn‚Äôt want to unnecessarily be in fight mode which stresses out your body over time.\r\n\r\nRead our full terms of service: \r\nhttps://healthzilla.ai/terms",

I just want this to be the best meditation app for combating stress on Android!\r\n\r\nThe app also includes a timer. By default, when the audio finishes (if there's time left) it will just play the audio again. Most audios are between 10 and 15 minutes, although the guided meditation is a full 20 minutes long!

However, if you want to change this you can in the application. You can change the duration of inspiration and expiration to the second you want to adapt the application entirely to your needs. In the long term, cardiac coherence brings significant benefits as for the practice of meditation.

            "Best phone benchmarks. You can download the desired benchmark mode in the app according to your phone's capabilities or you can try all of them so you can know your phone score in those modes. Compare up to 5 phones based on different benchmarking modes. Keep in mind some modes are heavy so mid-range phones will probably get stuttering performance",
            "Sling shot reliably crashes (freezes) after it finished. Not sure why that is, maybe compatibility issues... Revision : Also like others have said, it actually slows down your phone for some reason... I only installed the first test and it was using 800mb.. That tells me MEMORY LEAK simply. Also the app just keeps crashing now... 1 star would give 0 if possible",
            "If you want a higher score and not happy with the first test, disable most apps from running in the background so your phone is free to run the test. Waste of time if you dont disable backround apps beforehand, i scored an extra 121 points from disabling background apps and updating colorOS. Dont be a noob, change your settings for better results!",
            "I installed on many devices without issue,last time i install it on galaxy s8 plus it was crushing and the phone was rebooting ,it seems that i had a battery issue when i opened the phone the battery was swallen ,so its clear that the app is doing what it should do,good job",
            "Not optimized in new wildlife for Xiaomi mi note 10 lite.wildlife unlimited crashes and performance is so poor as rendering flashes visuals in wild life test.and scores are so much lower than expected.even Samsung a 51 is in lead than Mi note 10 lite.such powerfull adreno gpu and gets so poor scores.u need to fix this."

We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",

I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq üôèüôè",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

So it's literally useless. Turning the screen doesn't help either because it doesn't change directions! Absolutely ridiculous.",
            "On a scale of 1 to 5 I will give this app a three. The reason for this rating is because overall the app is really not that eye catching. The app is very basic and all categories to the point where the app would just be too boring to use. However the app is not all bad because of how simple it is it is very easy to navigate, even if you lose Signal it will still be able to use the breathing technique, you will not have to worry about your information getting leaked.",

            "Great app for daily measurements, the app went through changes, initially simple, really easy to use, then cluttered hard to find anything, current stage is actually simple to use again. Definitely worth using. Great work by developers.",
            "Seems to produce really great data. Good interface.. For a free app, it seems too good too be true! I say this in a good way.",
            "Excellent app for monitoring heart rate variability. No ads and feature rich. Highly recommended.",
            "Disappointed. I've used this app for years. I used to love it. The recent revision makes it harder to take readings - more screens to page through to get to the work, won't connect with my Polar H10, long delays for any function. It just isn't reliable, simple, or easy. I don't think they do any user testing to inform their design and flow engineering."

            "App went down April 8-9, 2019. since it's been back online, it glitches. It stops, somewhere in the middle of the meditation, then in the early morning, it will finish by waking me up, with the finish of the meditation. It's not a four star anymore. Too bad. I used to love this app, it was my favorite. * I reinstalled, it didn't help.",
            "Fastest way to meditate, just open app and select the version or time limit that suits you. Not as varied as Insight Timer, but If you need to relax NOW, and don't want to click on several pages before you get to the actual meditations, then this is the app for you. Instant meditations, no BS no loud or flashing ads, you are always seconds away from guided relaxation & grounding techniques. Simple, reliable and drama free access to guided meditations",
            "lovely music to induce deep relaxation, even when you think you might be too stressed to unwind. with tracks at 8 hours long, the music won't suddenly stop and jolt you out of your chilled groove. the woman who talks thru the meditations has a soothing voice, I was worried it might grate after a while, but I find it quite the opposite. I could do without the gong before and after meditations as I found it quite jarring, but that's my only gripe with otherwise decent spp",
            "I find this app very relaxing. The lady narrator has a warm and relaxing voice to listen to which makes meditation comfortable. Although the music meditations are nice, personally I prefer the guided meditations to chill and to go to sleep. I hope there will be another update soon will include more guided meditations.",
            "glitches and stops in the middle of meditation. No cool! when my phone goes to sleep so does the meditation, it does not continue as it should. Very annoying."

            "The game looks beautiful with its pencil art style. The drawing in each level is nice and the pop sound when you press anything is somewhat soothing. But if you're expecting a \"challenging puzzle\" from this game, you'd be disappointed, like me. This is a memory game, asking \"how well can you remember the image you just saw\".",

            "Good Game üëç. My only suggestion is when a player answers wrong option the next time when that particular answer appears just shuffle the options.",
            "Fantastic game. Beautifully done, but not for me. It gave me a more anxiety instead of being relaxing because I couldn't retain information from the previous slide. I played a ton of levels and will keep the app to try at a later time. Maybe I'm just having an off night. Great job, dev!",
            "Need refund this game is a scam. Only 14 reviews? all by dev's. Do Not Fall for it. there's a reason why no free trial. there are no directions. you show a drop of what looks like water and we have to figure out what it is. the number of birds for example. where is there a third one? or are we supposed to automatically add +1 at random. the game needs clear directions. you show birds all animated in answer but bird in picture is static, not moving. lot of inconistancies.

            "Great app.. ONLY GREAT IF OFFLINE.. a pretty big relaxing spa & ambient music selection. Nice looking user interface.. I use these kinds of music apps offline and I'm glad it works without internet connection. HOWEVER the app is TERRIBLE when you use it online with internet connection.. very intrusive pop up video ads with sounds, totally ruins the relaxing experience. Banner ads are enough to be honest. Just don't make the ads so annoying or intrusive and I'll change it from 3 stars to 5 stars.",

It can help you clear your mind and work off feelings of frustration and anxiety.\r\n- Don't drink or eat anything that has caffeine in it. Caffeine can make you feel \"wound up\" and more stressed.\r\n- Don't smoke or use tobacco. Nicotine can make you feel more anxious.\r\n- Don't drink alcohol.

It can help you calm down and take a step back from a stressful situation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cause of the anxiety won't disappear, you will probably feel more able to deal with it once you've released the tension in your body and cleared your thoughts.\r\n\r\nMany relaxation techniques combine breathing more deeply with relaxing the muscles.\r\n\r\nDon't worry if you find it difficult to relax at first. It's a skill that needs to be learned and it will come with practice.\r\n\r\nPractise deep breathing at a regular time and in a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. Loosen or remove any tight clothes you have on, such as shoes or jackets. Make yourself feel completely comfortable.\r\n\r\nSit in a comfy chair which supports your head or lie on the floor or bed. Place your arms on the chair arms, or flat on the floor or bed, a little bit away from the side of your body with the palms up. If you're lying down, stretch out your legs, keeping them hip-width apart or slightly wider.

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forwardüò•",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

But high levels of stress can have a serious impact on your mental and physical health so it‚Äôs important that you find ways to manage this.\r\n\r\nPeople find different things relaxing so we‚Äôve constructed a list of our fave chilling out tips and urge you to give them a try to see which ones work for you!\r\n\r\n1. Watch something funny. Laughter really is the best medicine. It relieves physical tension, reduces stress and increases immunity‚Ä¶so watch your fave comedy and laugh your way to tranquility.\r\n\r\n2. Body Clench. This relaxation exercise may make you look a bit constipated but give it a go! Starting with your toes, go up through your body, gradually clenching each of your muscles right through to the tiny ones in your face, keep your whole body clenched, hold and then release to let go of all the tension. Feels good, right?\r\n\r\n3. Try the Naam Yoga Hand Trick. Using your fingertips, apply pressure to the space between the knuckles of your index and middle fingers. This creates a sense of immediate relaxation by activating a nerve that loosens the area around your heart (don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not as life-threatening as it sounds).\r\n\r\n4. Stop multitasking. No wonder we‚Äôre all mega-stressed when we‚Äôre replying to text messages, whilst watching TV and speaking on the phone simultaneously! Not only is multitasking totally inefficient, but it‚Äôs also linked to the increased production of stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline) that can send your body into panic mode! So chill out and take things one step at a time.\r\n\r\n5. Get a Colouring Book. They‚Äôve exploded in popularity over recent months and for good reason ‚Äì colouring in helps you chill out because it‚Äôs very difficult to focus on other things when you‚Äôre doing it.\r\n6. Meditate. Create a little zen den in your room where you can meditate (e.g. light candles and incense, play calming music). Reaching a meditative state takes practice but there are some great tips for beginners online. Meditation can help ease anxiety and improve concentration, so peace out.\r\n\r\n7. Squeeze a stress ball. Using a stress ball can help alleviate tension by promoting muscle relaxation and providing a general sense of release.\r\n\r\n8. Keeping a diary. Venting all those thoughts and emotions onto paper can make your feelings and problems seem less intimidating. Writing can be both insightful and therapeutic so get those words down on paper!",

            "The app has an awesome start to it. Even when u make a mistake with trying to fly the duck it gives u positive feedback and makes you want to try it again and again. One suggestion I would add would be to change the spacing between cloud bubbles so duck can fly a little better when your upset. Also make an option to just be able to fly  the duck by tapping on it and just let it bounce off bubbles all around the screen. The sound effects are awesome. Keep up the good work",
            "I found this game extemely frustrating and stress inducing. It is to fast \npaced for calming down both in music and reaction time, and when I failed I \nheard a laugh sound which felt as though the game was mocking me. It may \nwork for some people but the complete opposite of calming for me."

Stress causes or aggravates issues like insomnia, anxiety, depression, and even headaches and chronic pain.\r\n\r\nWelcome to a better way to manage stress. \r\n\r\nResility helps you become more aware of how stress feels in your body, and gives you a much needed break from the stress cycle in order to rest and recover. Giving your body these breaks can improve mood, sleep, focus, productivity, and creativity.\r\n\r\nOur easy, 5-10 minute training sessions include a variety of relaxation and breathing exercises, mindfulness, and positive psychology. Try different things to see what works best for you. When you pair our app with our wearable bluetooth Muscle Activity Sensor (sold separately at ResilityHealth.com/sensor), you will get real-time biofeedback to actually see how your body is responding. This teaches you to recognize the early signs of stress, and head it off before it escalates. \r\n\r\nOur users are amazed at what a difference our short, 5 to 10 minute exercises can make.\r\n\r\nThe Resility app has three modes:\r\n\r\nRELAXATION TRAINING\r\nShort guided audio exercises walk you through a variety of relaxation techniques. These can be used alone, or with our wearable Muscle Activity Sensor (sold separately). Pairing with the Sensor lets you see how your muscle tension changes in response to an exercise.\r\n\r\nRelaxation training incorporates:\r\n-breathing exercises\r\n-muscle relaxation\r\n-mindfulness\r\n-visualization\r\n-positive psychology\r\n-biofeedback (with Muscle Activity Sensor)\r\n\r\nMONITOR MUSCLE ACTIVITY\r\nGet feedback on how your muscle activity changes in real time. This mode can only be used with our Muscle Activity Sensor, which uses electromyography, or EMG biofeedback, to measure the activity in a muscle. In Monitor mode you can set a threshold to get alerted when your muscle tension exceeds it. The alert can be an audible alarm or set to vibrate. Sessions can be recorded.\r\n\r\nMuscle tension in the shoulders is so common when you‚Äôre stressed, and it‚Äôs a popular place to use our Sensor. The alert cues you when your tension exceeds the threshold, and the biofeedback teaches to release that tension at will. You can do this when working at the computer or during tasks where your muscles inadvertently tense up. \r\n\r\nVIEW PROGRESS\r\nView the history of training and recorded monitoring sessions. See the date, length, and amount of muscle activity reduction together with a graph of how your muscle activity changed.

        "description": "Here, we would like to start, by giving you an introduction to what stress is, what the signs of stress are, what simple steps you can take when feeling stressed and provide practical advice for preventing it, to show why we are passionate about moving towards a less stressed nation.\r\nWhat is stress?\r\nStress is a feeling of being under abnormal pressure. This pressure can come from different aspects of your day to day life. Such as an increased workload, a transitional period, an argument you have with your family or new and existing financial worries. You may find that it has a cumulative effect, with each stressor building on top of one another.\r\n\r\nDuring these situations you may feel threatened or upset and your body might create a stress response. This can cause a variety of physical symptoms, change the way you behave, and lead you to experience more intense emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\nStress affects us in a number of ways, both physically and emotionally and in varying intensities.\r\nHow can I identify the signs of stress?\r\nEveryone experiences stress. However, when it is affecting your life, health and wellbeing, it is important to tackle it as soon as possible, and while stress affects everyone differently, there are common signs and symptoms you can look out for:15\r\n\r\nfeelings of constant worry or anxiety\r\nfeelings of being overwhelmed\r\ndifficulty concentrating\r\nmood swings or changes in your mood\r\ndifficulty relaxing\r\ndepression\r\nlow self-esteem\r\neating more or less than usual\r\nchanges in your sleeping habits\r\naches and pains, particularly muscle tension\r\nThree steps to take when feeling stressed\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Realise when it is causing you a problem\r\nTry to make the connection between feeling tired or ill and the pressures you are faced with\r\nLook out for physical warnings such as tense muscles, over-tiredness, headaches or migraines38\r\n2. Identify the causes\r\nTry to identify the underlying causes\r\nSort the possible reasons for your stress into three categories 1) those with a practical solution 2) those that will get better given time and 3) those you can‚Äôt do anything about\r\nTry to release the worry of those in the second and third groups and let them go\r\n3. Review your lifestyle\r\nCould you be taking on too much?\r\nAre there things you are doing which could be handed over to someone else?\r\nCan you do things in a more leisurely way?\r\nTo act on the answer to these questions, you may need to prioritise things you are trying to achieve and re-organise your life\r\nThis will help to release pressure that can come from trying to do everything at once\r\nHow can you help yourself?\r\nStress is a natural reaction to many situations in life, such as work, family, relationships and money problems.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned earlier on that a moderate amount of stress can help us perform better in challenging situations,34 but too much or prolonged stress can lead to physical problems. This can include lower immunity levels,35 digestive and intestinal difficulties, e.g. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),36 or mental health problems such as depression.37 It is therefore important that we manage our stress and keep it at a healthy level to prevent long-term damage to our bodies and minds.",

            "Thank you Annrika and Tim for this awesome app ! I have been doing the Sedona Method for many years now. And I have been doing the releasing almost every morning and every night on my own and it's been life changing. This app though has been like a treat, to just be able to let someone else guide me through whatever is arising, right in that moment, even if I don't even know what it is ( like some weird sensation in my gut that is stuck there, or the resistance that was stopping me from doing some things that I had to get done. I could not seem to move it... releasing on my own) So I just started listening to your lovely voice and afterwards... I just started to do what I had to do. It was like magic...!!! This app is such a valuable gift that you have so generously given to us. Even those of us who have been doing the SM for years. Both of your voices sound so wonderful, so gentle, compassionate, nurturing, loving and there is a sense of being held in a confident, secure, solid state of spacious, unconditional Love and Acceptance. And I also like how you have set the app up technically.... how you can find what you want and do it with ease... And.. Lots of good info about the Method releasing and how to use it.... for the beginners and for everyone.,. Very well done !! Thank you... Thank you.... I highly recommend this app to anyone, whether you are unfamiliar with the Sedona Method and Releasing or an experienced SM releaser !! Josephine Lawless",
            "Love this app. I've been getting a lot out of the releases. The only drawback is how the app keeps the screen on even when a recording has stopped and some time has passed. I mention this because the other night I fell asleep listening to a release--and because I hadn't plugged the charger in properly, I awoke to a nearly dead phone. Perhaps you could fix this on the next update? Otherwise, superb app. Thank you always, Annie and Tim! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "This is by far one of the most useful apps I have on my phone. I use it daily. I learned the Sedona Method 25 years ago. Have been using it ever since. The app is a wonderful new add on...proving...there's always more good to come. Consider this app as a best friend or companion that will gently guide you back to yourself when you're feeling \"off\"...and remind you how wonderful you truly are.",
            "Its perfectly succinct. Exactly what you need as a releaser to keep it simple, and go deeper.",
            "This app is amazing. I love the releases. It's really useful to use every day and I love there are subtitles too."

            "Very effective paced breathing app--my favorite out of a dozen I tried. I love the simple breathing circle paired with optional vibration cues so I can opt to close eyes or look away and still keep pace. I like the different background choices, and selection of different breathing paces for different effects. I'd love to see the app developed to add music and/or tone options for relaxation, binaural beats, and auditory pace cues. But even without that, it's still my go-to breathing app. Update 7/18: Unfortunately the app, when installed on my new phone (Asus ZenPhone Z01FD), will no longer load any background images, even after trying to uninstall and reinstall). When clicking \"background,\" I only get a black screen with no options. I'm hopeful for an update to fix this.",

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Cause every time I tried to record, it was an incomplete conversation. I was just trying out the app, and I'm uninstalling it for now. Maybe if they fix the problems I will reinstall.",
            "This is a great app. I love this app because it makes it easier to keep everything in the same place. However, suddenly the speak option doesnt work. I can't speak into it which it the option I usually use because it's unfiltered and I don't have to over think when I type. If it wasn't for this it would be 5 stars",
            "Great app, only problem I can't use the microphone/ audio option to record my thoughts. Really disappointed, will give a 5 star once it's fixed",
            "Great app. I think this app is ideal for anyone whose not used to self-reflecting. The way the conversation is structured makes you literally step out of your thoughts and take an unbiased perspective of whatever you‚Äôve got going on. It‚Äôs helping me so much in clearing my thoughts. I love it and highly recommend it!",
            "I was struggling to sleep for like 5 nights in a row, I just couldnt switch off because of some stuff I had going on. This app just let me vent, but also kept those thoughts in a bank so I knew that the venting wasn‚Äôt a waste of time and that seems to do the trick for me. I sleep like a baby for the last two nights. It‚Äôs been a godsend. And I just read through what I wrote in the morning."

You try to squish a ball just a few times, then they force you to watch an ad if you want to squish it around just a few more times. For toys other than balls, you can't really squish them; they just have different filters when you tap them and do the same thing with the other toys. I would appreciate not having to watch an ad for every little thing.",
            "the game has the option to first make the slime and then play with it. For this, you just need to add the powder in the bowl, add the color of your choice then add the glue. After that put some detergent and then mix it well with the spatula. Start stretching the jelly toy until ready.",
            "I wish I code of rate it 0 so many ads Super boring do not get it it is . Wase of your time and battery power and some of the squishy are super werid",

        "description": "Stress is common experience for most people. In fact, 70% of adults say they feel stress or  daily.\r\n\r\nHere are some simple ways to relieve stress and anxiety.\r\nExercise\r\nExercise is one of the most important things you can do to combat stress.\r\n\r\nIt might seem contradictory, but putting physical stress on your body through exercise can relieve mental stress.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are strongest when you exercise regularly. People who exercise regularly are less likely to experience anxiety than those who don‚Äôt exercise (1).\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons behind this:\r\n\r\nStress hormones: Exercise lowers your body‚Äôs stress hormones ‚Äî such as cortisol ‚Äî in the long run. It also helps release endorphins, which are chemicals that improve your mood and act as natural painkillers.\r\nSleep: Exercise can also improve your sleep quality, which can be negatively affected by stress and anxiety.\r\nConfidence: When you exercise regularly, you may feel more competent and confident in your body, which in turn promotes mental wellbeing.\r\nTry to find an exercise routine or activity you enjoy, such as walking, dancing, rock climbing or yoga.\r\nActivities ‚Äî such as walking or jogging ‚Äî that involve repetitive movements of large muscle groups can be particularly stress relieving.\r\nConsider supplements\r\nSeveral supplements promote stress and anxiety reduction. Here is a brief overview of some of the most common ones:\r\n\r\nLemon balm: Lemon balm is a member of the mint family that has been studied for its anti-anxiety effects (2).\r\nOmega-3 fatty acids: One study showed that medical students who received omega-3 supplements experienced a 20% reduction in anxiety symptoms (3).\r\nAshwagandha: Ashwagandha is an herb used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat stress and anxiety. Several studies suggest that it‚Äôs effective (4).\r\nGreen tea: Green tea contains many polyphenol antioxidants which provide health benefits. It may lower stress and anxiety by increasing serotonin levels (5).\r\nValerian: Valerian root is a popular sleep aid due to its tranquilizing effect. It contains valerenic acid, which alters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors to lower anxiety.\r\nKava kava: Kava kava is a psychoactive member of the pepper family. Long used as a sedative in the South Pacific, it is increasingly used in Europe and the US to treat mild stress and anxiety (6).\r\nSome supplements can interact with medications or have side effects, so you may want to consult with a doctor if you have a medical condition.\r\nShop for ashwagandha, omega-3 supplements, green tea, and lemon balm online.\r\nLight a candle\r\nUsing essential oils or burning a scented candle may help reduce your feelings of stress and anxiety.\r\n\r\nSome scents are especially soothing. Here are some of the most calming scents:\r\n\r\nLavender\r\nRose\r\nVetiver\r\nBergamot\r\nRoman chamomile\r\nNeroli\r\nFrankincense\r\nSandalwood\r\nYlang ylang\r\nOrange or orange blossom\r\nGeranium\r\nReduce your caffeine intake\r\nCaffeine is a stimulant found in coffee, tea, chocolate and energy drinks. High doses can increase anxiety (10).\r\n\r\nPeople have different thresholds for how much caffeine they can tolerate.\r\n\r\nIf you notice that caffeine makes you jittery or anxious, consider cutting back.\r\n\r\nAlthough many studies show that coffee can be healthy in moderation, it‚Äôs not for everyone. In general, five or fewer cups per day is considered a moderate amount.\r\nTake a yoga class\r\nYoga has become a popular method of stress relief and exercise among all age groups.\r\n\r\nWhile yoga styles differ, most share a common goal ‚Äî to join your body and mind.\r\n\r\nYoga primarily does this by increasing body and breath awareness.\r\n\r\nSome studies have examined yoga‚Äôs effect on mental health. Overall, research has found that yoga can enhance mood and may even be as effective as antidepressant drugs at treating depression and anxiety (17).\r\n\r\nHowever, many of these studies are limited, and there are still questions about how yoga works to achieve stress reduction.",

        "description": "About RCube\r\n\r\nRCube is an effective app that protects & facilitates good judgement and decision making, productivity and health even under duress, and when exposed to change and in crisis. This is achieved through reducing negative stress, anxiety and low mood and by building positive resources for adaptive resilience and sustainable peak performance.\r\n\r\nThe Assessments and techniques are developed by our experienced medical team and are based on neuroscience, positive psychology, behavioural science and physiology. RCube offers an integrated approach towards building adaptive resilience, addressing mind and body simultaneously to achieve faster and more sustainable results.\r\n\r\nWhat does RCube do\r\n\r\nRCube supports companies who wish to help their employees reduce stress, anxiety, low mood and build emotional resilience. It helps your business in 3 ways:\r\n\r\n1. Reducing stress, anxiety and low mood by protecting your employees from mental health problems   \r\n2. Building emotional resilience helps your employees to develop a greater ability to cope with everyday hassles and major stressors\r\n3. Physiological and neuro-psychological training exercises enhance workplace wellbeing and help to protect performance and productivity under pressure\r\n\r\nMain features of RCube\r\n\r\nAssessments\r\n‚òÖ Wellbeing Check: Based on a symptom assessment, to personalise training programmes and track intensity of symptoms\r\n‚òÖ Acute Stress Assessment: Based on real time heart rate variability to measure and track strain, engagement and recovery\r\n\r\n Personalised  Trainings\r\n‚òÖ Acute Stress Release Techniques to assist in before, during and after experiencing challenging situations\r\n‚òÖ Engagement Training is a audio-guided breathing exercise to reduce stress and anxiety and build resources for resilience and sustainable peak performance under pressure.\r\n‚òÖ Biofeedback Training assesses the user's personal resonant frequency, which is the individual pace of breath that carries optimal training effects.
