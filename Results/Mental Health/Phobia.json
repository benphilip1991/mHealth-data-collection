        "description": "A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent fear of an object or situation. The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.\r\n\r\nPhobias can be divided into specific phobias, social phobia, and agoraphobia. Types of specific phobias include those to certain animals, natural environment situations, blood or injury, and specific situations. The most common are fear of spiders, fear of snakes, and fear of heights. Occasionally they are triggered by a negative experience with the object or situation. Social phobia is when the situation is feared as the person is worried about others judging them. Agoraphobia is when fear of a situation occurs because it is felt that escape would not be possible.\r\n\r\nSpecific phobias should be treated with exposure therapy where the person is introduced to the situation or object in question until the fear resolves. Medications are not useful in this type of phobia. Social phobia and agoraphobia are often treated with some combination of counselling and medication. Medications used include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers.\r\n\r\nSpecific phobias affect about 6–8% of people in the Western world and 2–4% of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in a given year. Social phobia affects about 7% of people in the United States and 0.5–2.5% of people in the rest of the world. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of people. Women are affected about twice as often as men. Typically onset is around the age of 10 to 17. Rates become lower as people get older. People with phobias are at a higher risk of suicide.\r\n\r\nSupport Language:\r\n\r\n\r\n- English\r\n- Español\r\n- français\r\n- korean\r\n- portugis\r\n- ukraina",

But am I able to use a gamepad?",

        "description": "Features: \r\n• Enter your own personal fear \r\n• Create a fear hierarchy\r\n• Complete exposure tasks while live updating your anxiety levels\r\n\r\nEffective against: \r\n• Phobias (snakes, spiders, heights, flying, etc.)\r\n• Social anxiety disorder\r\n• Post-traumatic stress disorder\r\n• Panic disorder\r\n• Generalized anxiety disorder\r\n• Obsessive-compulsive disorders \r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nExposure therapy is one of psychology's greatest, most effective treatment tools that have been discovered over the past few decades. A key technique in behavior therapy for anxiety, exposure therapy involves gradually exposing someone to their feared object, situation, or task without any danger in order to overcome their anxiety. This app enables people to go through exposure therapy.\r\n\r\nBefore exposure, users first create a fear hierarchy - a list of activities that induce anxiety ranked from highest to lowest. Then, they work through the activities in the fear hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-inducing activity and working their way up.\r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. \r\n\r\nDetailed Guide: \r\nMany people with phobias recognize their fear as illogical, but their mind is still afraid nonetheless. This is because the primal fear centers of our mind act subconsciously whenever it spots anything it thinks is dangerous (such as lions or snakes) in order to escape immediately. However, in today's modern society when we don't have to worry about predators eating us, our minds can often trigger false alarms to things that aren't actually dangerous. \r\n\r\nThe fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there. \r\n\r\nTo break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous. The most important principle is to make sure that the fear leaves before you do. \r\n\r\nThis app helps you break the fear. First, add what you are afraid of and then construct a list of activities that will induce various levels of anxiety. Then, you can start exposing yourself by doing these activities starting from what gives you the least amount of anxiety. During the exposure process, you can track your anxiety levels by updating it continuously, and finish when it falls to 20/100 or lower. As you work your away through the activities, your fear should continue to fall! \r\n\r\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. If you leave the activity before your anxiety falls, then this will actually reinforce your fear instead of lowering it. Try starting with the easiest activity first. Going straight to a challenging task might actually increase your fear. It is very difficult to stay in a situation when your entire body is screaming at you to leave, especially if there is no person there coaxing you to stay and wait.",

Also the mindfulness section only has 4 things to look at, it would be nice if more were added.",
            "i used clear fear for a while now and im so glad i found it because its really helping. i would give 5 stars if there wasnt this little problem that gets super annoying after while. if you log into the app the first time you answer some questions like selecting which part of the world ur from, set ur passcode and a security question and all of that stuff and i confirmed everything but if i open the app i have to answer all of the questions again, like i havent answered them. please fix that!!",
            "Good app, just two notes. When I try to type a text I cannot scrol the screen down enough to keep seeing the textbox. It disappears behind my keyboard. And I would like some excercises in it that are also in calm harm. It seems that app contains more coping strategies than just cbt and a breathing excercise it also has more interaction than clear fear. But it is a bit weird to read about harm when it is about anxiety. Another option would be to choose in the harm app what one is using it for.",
            "This was an ok app but there are only two things you can do to calm you down. A breathing activity and the same recording of a person telling you how to calm down. Other than that it's just an app to write down goals. There is also no option to record an attack after it happened and instead you must go through one of the activities and say that it helped so that you can record something. Even then it'll not show up for awhile until the week ends. There could be many improvements but its ok.",
            "I was recommended to this application by my therapist, and found the resources in this application helpful. However, I do realise that there is a bug that doesn't save your information when you close out of the application. Therefore, I would have to manually key in all my details from startup again. Other than the issue I mentioned, the application overall is great."

Fear in itself can be debilitating and can limit a person's ability to go through life in a healthy way. Sometimes, a person's fear can rule a person's life and he becomes bereft of reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA person who allows his fear to rule his life can be prevented from leading a normal life. The sad fact is that the person who has the fear is not the only one affected, but also his family, friends, and the people around him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFear can be healthy because it allows a person to be on his toes and to be watchful of what is happening around him. A person can actually make his fears work for him instead of against him. Then again, this requires a lot of self-control and positive thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA person's fear can be caused by an event that happened some time ago, or by a belief that he is not capable of dealing with something or someone. There are fears that have a real basis, but most fears are just the creations of one's imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhobia is also a fear of something, but such fear can be considered irrational. A phobia can be ridiculous and exaggerated such as a person's fear of cats or of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people who have developed phobias are aware that the fear is not based on rational thinking; but unfortunately, they are not able to get hold of their emotions and rise above their irrational fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people are quick to equate phobia with insanity; but it is not fair to conclude that just because a person is phobic, it means that there must be something wrong with his sanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA person's phobia can sometimes be embarrassing, especially when he is not able to control such fear. There are people who actually shiver and hide when confronted with their phobias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhobias can be simple like the simple fear of being in an enclosed area, or complex like the fear of riding an airplane. A social fear can be manifested in the fear of public speaking or of being surrounded by a crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost phobias are characterized by panic attacks such as when the person is confronted by his phobia and he is forced to come face-to-face with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is normal to be afraid because fear is rational. However, a fear that becomes irrational and is already without basis, is already called a phobia. It is no longer normal and can disrupt a person's lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA person who wants to get rid of his phobia should not turn to doctors who dig deeper just to discover the root cause of the phobia. Such an activity can be a waste of time because finding the underlying cause of the phobia will not get rid of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is more important is to be determined and strong-willed so that the person's fears will no longer rule his emotions.

        "description": "There is something in all of us that responds involuntarily to different stressors and the complexity of life which is suggested be the fundamental problem of all mental illnesses. It grows and thrives as a consequence, goes beyond tolerance, making our lives miserable. Lives are complicated and we cannot stay on top of our problems all the time. People are just being hammered in many ways and that lead to their collapse in the direction of their genetic susceptibility and biological weakness.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app is developed as a tool for introspection and will provide you with evidence-based information about emotional problems and mental disorders. It will teach you cognitive behavioural therapy and other self-help methods, and techniques, specifically designed to help with overcoming depression, generalized anxiety and worry, social anxiety and shyness, divorce and separation, loss and bereavement. It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking. Cognitive behavioural therapy is proven to be effective in the long term by applying the techniques and shift the way you think. It can help you find a meaning and purpose, negotiate with yourself and be free from your past. \r\n\r\n“Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind;\r\nFor the soul is dyed by the thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Depression section, you will learn more about psychological, medical and alternative treatments for relief, reduction, prevention and dealing with major depressive disorders, dysthymia, bipolar disorder. By using the self-help methods you can learn helpful ways of thinking, that will help overcome depression now and in the future. It will also help you to practice ways of living your life and relating to people that leave you less vulnerable to depression.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Anxiety and Worry (GAD) section you will have the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and worry and whether you are a worrier. A helpful set of strategies will show you how to deal with the purpose, meaning, and content of your worries. And, at the end, you will have a different perspective on how to manage it. The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n•\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you'll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief. Although it's not possible to turn back the clock or remove the fact of a loss, you may find some of these ideas are useful for helping with your grief.\r\n\r\n*The app is not designed to treat clinical levels of depression or anxiety, or other mental health disorders. Further counseling is needed as the diagnosis and treatment require a medical practitioner or a qualified mental health professional.",

And the feet are like, pixelated too, with distorted spagetti-stick lookin' legs for walking instead of humane legs. When I fall off the skyscraper, YOU DONT EVEN FLY! You hit the ground! And as soon as you hit the ground, an AD just COMES in your headset, blurring your vision. This is rated 0 stars for me. 😒😒",

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

        "description": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is an anxiety disorder characterized by a significant amount of fear in one or more social situations, causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some parts of daily life. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others.\r\nPhysical symptoms often include excessive blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Stammering may be present, along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events.

For serious treatment plans and diagnosis, one should always go to a professional doctor or psychologist.\r\n\r\nIn this app, you will find useful testing information regarding some of the most common mental disorders. Mental health is extremely important in one's life. You will be asked questions regarding specific mental health issues and at the end get a result. According to the result, you will also be getting recommendations regarding treatment. Get fruitful testing and treatment information regarding the following mental health and personality disorders:\r\n\r\n1) Depression: Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia.\r\n\r\n2) Sociopathy: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. A low moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\n3) ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with executive function.\r\n\r\n4) Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and abnormally elevated moods. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, individuals may experience crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.\r\n\r\n5) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions, and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.\r\n\r\n6) Anxiety: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, while fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate and shakiness. There are several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. An individual may have more than one anxiety disorder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "This app is amazing! It helps you to pinpoint your fears and to recognise the cognitions behind these fears. It then works on replacing the negative cognitions with positive cognitions. The idea is that you repeat these positive cognitions over and over again until you really feel and believe them. Each time I have used the app, I have felt much calmer and at peace afterwards, like a weight has been lifted. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who suffers with anxiety or fears!"

Do you want to know if you suffer from Social Phobia?\r\nDownload the application and take the tests now! In it you will find a test that evaluates social anxiety and another that evaluates social phobia. Each test will show you a result according to your score and will give you a complete interpretation to know if you suffer from anxiety problems or social phobia.\r\n\r\nSocial anxiety is a type of anxiety that is experienced in situations that involve social interaction: when interacting with other people, for example when having a date, a conversation or when meeting friends.\r\n\r\nIt is normal that we can feel nervous in some social situations such as a job interview or a date. This anxiety, if it does not exceed certain limits, is normal and adaptive since it prepares us to face the social situation to which we are heading.\r\n\r\nSocial anxiety becomes pathological when the person experiences social anxiety in most of the social situations of their day to day, intensely, with high discomfort and damaging or avoiding social relationships.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of social anxiety:\r\n\r\n- Fear and fear of social situations.\r\n- Anxiety for fear of feeling embarrassed, humiliated or judged\r\n- Fear of interacting or speaking with strangers\r\n- Fear that others will notice your anxiety\r\n- Nervousness, palpitations, sweating, movement of the legs and hands, upset stomach, trembling voice, difficulty breathing, muscle tension ...\r\n- Constantly analyze your performance in social situations.\r\n- Frequent avoidance of social activities.\r\nIf you experience anxiety in your social interactions or feel recognized in the symptoms, it is very likely that you have social anxiety problems. Take the test now to know your level of social anxiety and if you should worry and consult a doctor or mental health professional.\r\n\r\nSocial anxiety must be treated as it will cause negative repercussions in the life of the person who suffers it by limiting their social relationships and promoting a maladaptive way of thinking and feeling that harms their vital development.\r\n\r\nSome of the complications that are related to social anxiety are: low self-esteem, negative thoughts, hypersensitivity, low social skills, isolation, problems in social relationships, difficulties in academic and work development, substance abuse or suicide attempts.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between social anxiety and social phobia?\r\n\r\nSocial anxiety and social phobia can refer to the same concept: difficulties when interacting with other people. A person who experiences social anxiety does not have to have a social phobia disorder.\r\n\r\nA person with a social phobia disorder will experience a very high social anxiety when relating to relationships and a high rate of avoidance of social relationships that will justify the diagnostic label of \"social phobia.\"\r\n\r\nSocial anxiety and social phobia are treatable, they can be cured. If you suffer from social anxiety or social phobia, you should consult your family doctor to refer you to a psychologist and psychiatrist to start your treatment and reduce the incidence of social anxiety in your life. With proper treatment, anyone with anxiety or social phobia can be cured.\r\n\r\nDo you think you experience social anxiety when dating? Do you get nervous when interacting with other people? Do you experience discomfort when talking to someone?\r\n\r\nTake the test now and find out if you have anxiety or social phobia!\r\n\r\nYou will find two tests: one for social anxiety and the other for social phobia. Both will give you a score based on your results and a complete interpretation that will explain if you have anxiety or social phobia and how seriously.\r\n\r\nFind out if you suffer from Social Anxiety or Social Phobia by taking the tests now!",

The font and colours are actually making me anxious. I'll still give it a shot, but a more minimal look would go far in improving user experience.",

I was terrified and missed a meeting due to an anxiety attack. I used the public speaking app (along with taking good care of myself, like sleeping 8 hours) and I swear, I didn't know where the words came from! I delivered my report professionally and my supervisor had a proud smile. I'm amazed at how much my life has changed!"

I feel more centered. I keep waiting for this feeling to disappear but thank God, it hasn't. I don't really understand the internal psychological process that your SOAR course affected within me; however, I know it happened. I feel almost as good and comfortable about flying as I did prior to my fear of flying days. And if this could happen to me, I know the SOAR course can work for anyone.\r\n\r\n==\r\n\r\nUntil I had taken SOAR I absolutely did not travel by airplane or step into an elevator because of being confined to small areas and the feeling of being trapped as well as the fear of not being safe.

Thank you so much for SOAR - I'm glad I've discovered it!\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nThere are no words to describe the impact. I cried, laughed, and sometimes my mouth just gaped open at hearing such new, concrete information about fear and fear management. Some of this information has affected all aspects of my life. Sound dramatic? It has been.\r\n\r\nUnbelievable. Unforgettable. And impossible had it not been for SOAR. I only wish I had found you sooner. I was given your name by a client who took your course to help his occupation as a rock-n-roll tour manager. I said if it can help him, why not give it a shot?

            "Best app of its kind. I initially got the app for binaural beats and have slowly built up my inventory. I've been using Glenn's meditations for about 2 yrs now and love every one. I've notice improvement in any area I use these for with nightly, consistent use. Highly recommend for inner balance and higher quality of mind and life.",
            "Thats fantastic, it would be nice to have more of a selection of like binaural tracks and meditation music you can play after a hypnosis track. And I wish the tracks were a little cheaper because I won't run my bill up hundreds to download the entire content but I am very interested in hearing them..",
            "I use this app all the time it works I do have a request though. It would be much better.. When you select to repeat your selection over and over;. please fix it so it doesn't start with disclaimer for driving while listening or descrobing what you expect.. I'm usally relaxed or asleep at that point and it startles me when it starts over. If repeat is selected I suggest forwarding it to a soothing point of the session. 5 stars if done. Thanks either way love your work.",
            "I made a Playlist of important tracks followed by the relaxation and sleep track with a sleep ending. I am a worrier and have never been good at falling asleep. However, I have noticed a huge improvement in my sleep habits. I will be sharing this app with my team of doctors because one had asked me who I use. I'm really pleased with the app! The price isn't bad, either. I bought a few hypnosis CDs, too. These tracks are more effective and cheaper than the CDs.",
            "This app gives a wonderful feeling with all its musical effects and suggestions.. My heart rate was reduced considerably at the end of session which means am getting really relaxed. I heard some of them were not able to listen to the complete audio as they fell asleep within 10 mins. Keep doing good job."

At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",

For sure, there are a number of factors that cause anxiety disorders and phobias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxiety disorders and phobias can be triggered by a number of stressful situations.

Phobias are reactions to “natural threats” to a person’s well-being, for example, the fear of spiders or the fear of heights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference lies in the severity of the fear reaction.

            "I love this app. I really love this app. But it would be very good if this app had the question and answer option, which we can only find in the browser version. I am giving it a 5 star anyway, but this app really should have this option. In this way, more people will be interested in downloading this app... Also, it would be the best help of the users of wikihow app. Thank you very much. The authority should consider this thing. Love wikihow.",
            "..if U Need to know how to do it- U can more than likely find 'HOW TO;' In This Awesome App! It's not Glitchy & Not A BUNCH Of ADS! I REALLY WISH MORE APP DEVELOPERS WOULD FASHION THEIR APPS AS EASY TO USE & AS CLEAN( no ads!) AS THIS APP! THE WEB WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER PLACE TO PLAY, STUDY, ETC.THANX 4 A TRULY GREAT & USEFUL APP! Cj..",
            "I love this app. However , there are articles that maybe are bad . For example , it teaches how to hack a computer which is illegal. And many other stuff . I can't send articles to messenger , I can only send in Email or other apps which is annoying. Third , how can I ask a question ? I know there is a Q&A but where is the button that let's you ask a question ?? . This better be fixed , I give this app 3,5/5 . I hope you developers read this . Thank you 😊",
            "It does'nt show pictures as in the web site,and,there is no question and answer option,anyway,cool app though it really helps you know how to do things. I'm sure when these things are fixed,this may be the coolest how-to app to me.",
            "The app functions very well, it runs smoothly and has an easy to use UI. The overall usefulness of the app is debatable as the majority of the information provided in the articles is usually just common sense. The app has a \"random\" button that will provide a random article everytime it is pressed, this is a good feature as it can be fun to see what random pieces of often useless information you are given."

            "I like the apo because as I was listening to the ADHD therapy one I started to remember something I forgot to do (it isnt good when that happens to me, u get worried an anxious ) and the sounds distracted that thought to where I couldn't concentrate on it. It helped because if not it might have led to an anxiety attack and/or mental breakdown.",
            "Love all of them, especially the anxiety one but I wish it didn't have those few spots where the sound breaks, and mine won't loop so it should have a timer so you can do longer than 10 minutes.",
            "i get really bad tic attacks because of anxiety and the anxiety one doesnt work but the adhd one helps so much thank you",
            "I love it, I use the anxiety track and it actually does make me feel more calm most the time. Only thing that would be nice was if you could have the option for a timer. For example if I wanna play a track on repeat as I try to fall asleep but I don't want it still playing after I fall asleep. So if I could set it to stop playing after an hour or so. That would be great.",
            "I have severe anxiety and a lot of things set me off. One thing I get extremely anxious about is the world ending so hearing rain doesn't calm me at all. It only gives me an anxiety attack. Instead I use the pain reliever music for my anxiety"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

I rarely give a 5/5 rating for any app, but this one deserves it! It's a must-have for everyone who want to be prepared for worst case scenarios.",
            "Has a lot of good information. Wish it was organized a bit better so that you could more easily and quick get to the information your looking for. It has a lot of good information but because of that it can take a min to find the right info and when your in a survival situation and needed this the phone battery is very import to keep up. Other than that though it's a great informative app.",
            "Very well written. Lots of useful information that seems intuitive but sometimes you just don't know until you do. Thanks for the great app at a price you can't beat. Hopefully people are smart and print all this out on paper and create their own book ... or just use one of the power tips to make sure your phone will always be charged to have a look here. Thanks again, sincerely.",
            "Great app. Wide-ranging repository of useful information. Great navigation, very educational. Although I haven't used it in a survival situation, I imagine having it on your phone might not be the best way to carry it.",
            "This is really good advice for when shtf. Many different life saving (possibly) strategies. I recommend a \"preread\" to kind of get the grasp of things. Could be better layout, but GREAT nonetheless. Gets a thumbs up in my book!"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I love this app, but there is so many ads!!! I am using the app less now because of it and I'm now using another app instead, which I admit isn't as good, when i try to read picture quotes a 5 second ad will pop up after every one, haven't experienced any bugs or crashes or app shut down, just an overload of ads, annoying!! I will give it some time, if ads are still an issue, I will probably delete, I wouldn't mind paying for premium, with no ads, but currently not an option.",
            "I love this app. I dont usualky rate apos, but have found this one worthy of a rate. The ads are not to annoying, but the quotes are really amazing, inspiring and very relevant at times 😂 I love how you can listen to various types of hypnosis' and meditations, whether guided or musical, that cover a varitety if topics. Would definately recommend this app!!",
            "I really enjoy these. The updates have helped with the crashing. I wish those with music would keep repeating like they did briefly but an update stopped that. They have been very helpful to overcome abusive brain washing and help me to better use the law of attraction to change my life. I love it. Thank you!",
            "I use this app pretty much every day. It has a variety of wonderful tools to help me heal and grow. There are options to suit everyone & new content added regularly. All you need to get the most from this app is an open mind and a willingness to change for the better. I am grateful to the developers. I would love to have the option to upgrade to an add free version. The adds really detract from all the wonderful aspects of the app.",
            "Since the update, it crashes during the hypnosis, which makes you have to start over. The ADS omg!! Now I cant even choose the hypnosis I want to listen to because of your ads in the way of very important hypnosis. Very disappointed"

            "Very useful app, which will be of great help. Mark is an excellent hypnotist. His 'Relief From Arthritis' hypnotherapy session is also excellent for example. Not only has it helped me to control the pain, but the night time session sends me to sleep at the end nearly every night. Highly recommended.",
            "Amazing app. Its been couple of weeks since I have uploaded this app. I have been listening to the getting rid of procrastination every night before going to bed. I feel like its helping me. The app has range of content to listen to. I'll go through most of them. Its like meditation. I am feeling the positive change. I would definately recommend to people out there looking for a positive change in their life. Check the content in this app.",
            "Relax and improve yourself at the same time. I find the relaxation really helps me to slow down and live more deliberately. Mark quickly made it to my top favorite hypno recordings. His soothing voice is his magic ingredient to making the world disappear for 30 minutes. This app makes getting a session easy and convenient.",
            "This is by far the best hypnosis package out there. Mark Bowden helps you to get to the route of your issue in such relaxing and enjoyable hypnosis sessions. There are so many to choose from and you are able to pick and choose sessions which can work well together. His voice is extremely calming and with regular use, I can guarantee that you can expect genuine healing and positive changes in your life. Lucy MacMaster 🌈",
            "Great sessions. Better than expected. 3 stars given due to interrupted playback when offline/playing downloaded sessions. Please develop an option to play purchased sessions outside of the app to eliminate this problem which has been reported by users on the website as well."

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

I'm not a book reader ad this was my first ever book I read as an adult (I'm 35). Dont even question Geert. Just listen.... and you will find some sort of healing. His app is the same! I open it almost everyday. It might need a little updating but I really didn't care cause the content is exactly what I needed in my life right now.",

I also like the way I get a quote every day. You do get ads on the app, but they are small and at the bottom of the screen. Anyone who is interested in the philosophy of Stoicism would benefit from downloading this app. It is absolutely FREE! NO ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION! ISN'T THAT AWESOME? Go ahead... click that button.",
            "Love this, especially the fullscreen part where it changes font. Although, I wish we could do the same with the quotes we search for (in the searchbox), they don't transform into the beautiful italic version and I have to wait for them to show up again (in normal mode). Either way, thank you for creating this. :)",
            "Excellent app. The only improvement I can think of would be to make the daily quote static so I can revisit the quote throughout the day. Right now, it generates a different quote each time you access the app. But other than that this has been a very useful app to me. Good way to start the day.",
            "Nice contents but it takes you back to the beginning whenever you leave the app, I will like to continue from where I stopped whenever I revisit the app. when this is done you'll have my 5 star rating.",
            "Only issue is the daily quote doesn't change. It worked for awhile and hasn't changed for a week now. Also the ads being full screen audio can be annoying esp if you forgot you had your volume on."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and last for more than six months. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations. In severe cases people may become unable to leave their homes. Agoraphobia is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think £50 for 30 minutes and £100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like £49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. £99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for £70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

But still does okay. This App has lots more the the constitution, Bill of Right, Getty Address, Federalis papers, and much much more.",
            "On my phone, tablet and laptop. Handy for checking references to the Constitution for exact language. Particularly useful during the impeachment, and now during the election. Easy to use TOC and search features.",
            "Does not allow and copy / clip of any more than one word in the app. Wow. It's not like there needs to be Copyright protection of a very \"public domain\" document. Uninstalled.",
            "The app downloaded fast, the size is small, and the catalog of documents included is really impressive. No need to go download multiple apps. Navigation is easy enough. My only complaint is that it's way too easy to trigger the horizontal swipe, and the documents change a little too easily, so much so simple vertical scrolling will trigger a swipe to the next document, and then I'll lose my place when i come back. Perhaps the developer can institute a threshold for horizontal swipes.",
            "Any device specific bugs aside that you may encounter (it has been 2 years since updating but functions fine for me, others have mentioned newly added Android features not cooperating within the app), the dev offers a no-frills, no-nonsense, digital copy of the U.S. Constitution in an app less than 1MB, as it shoud be. Many thanks to him for that, but more importantly to the many founding fathers whos legacy and vision we strive to carry on today and beyond."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Good graphics (mouth movements need some help.), good storyline, some inconsistencies, but, not too bad. EXPENSIVE! Unless you have A LOT of patience and timing. The 8 hour conversations, that take 30+ energy to complete 1/5 of it. Ridiculous. And , forbid, you can't make it back in time to finish it..... all that time and energy wasted. I spent some money in the game and regret it. It really isn't worth it. Do the math.",
            "I love this game! The storyline, characters mini games and more. However I do have a minor issue with the energy. It runs out really quickly and takes quite a long time to recharge again. Another small thing with the energy is sometimes if I'm over the energy limit, the excess energy I collect does not count and sometimes I lose a bit of energy because of this. However amazing game! Definitely worth downloading :)",
            "Frustrating at times, when it comes to events. You either have to be willing to put in real money or accept the fact you aren't going to win. Dueling spell chances are overpowering against you, only getting 1 stun in three matches (which is often)! While the opponent can get it one every 2-3 spells to maximum effect. The story is good and thrilling, good character relationships and lore. I've been playing since day one but you can see where the money grab is, which I have fallen into?",
            "New review: I've been playing this a lot since lockdown, and am contantly impressed with the creativity and new stuff the devs come up with, for what is essentially a free game. Yes, they do push real money transactions, but if you don't mind spending more time on it, you get everything anyway. This game has an interesting story, lots of side quests, animals to interact with and loads of options to customise your character and dorm. And all of it in Hogwarts! :)",
            "The game can be fun sometimes so I put 2 stars. However, its really just a scheme to make as much money from the players as possible. While the idea is a free to play concept, the amount of time it takes to recharge energy is actually ridiculous. They are constantly releasing time sensitive events that give the players less than 5 days to complete which on the surface is fine and kind of fun. But it is literally impossible to complete all of the tasks with the limited energy = pay to win game."

Bad: Ads occupy a significant portion of the (non reading)screens and come in your face(Can purchase a pro version to remove ads but it seems contrary to the sprit of a free project such as Guntenberg being used to earn profit).",

The lack of a dark mode, something so common in pretty much every app imaginable these days, makes this app unusuable for me and I'm sure many others. Until they get a proper dark mode (something I have in ALL of the apps that I use), I would advise folk to stay away.",

            "Band has been fantastic! I've been using it for the last 3 years since I became cheer director for our local youth league. It keeps me organized and everything in one spot. Its so helpful with parents. You can add everyone to your band and set things how you want them. They even have a live streaming option, polls, attendance and sooo much more. I will always use band for any group stuff I may have.",
            "I love the original Band App. It works so well from. My team at work and our daughters softball team to communicate with the parents. I recently downloaded the BAND FOR KIDS for my daughter to talk to her teammates, it hasn't worked yet. I have paid 2 different times, $.50 and I still can't make it work.",
            "Great app--has essentially transformed our group's communication. Feature request: Please allow toggling the visibility of calendars within a Band. If we have multiple calendars created for different purposes, it would be nice to be able to declutter the agenda view by hiding events from irrelevant calendars. Also, please let us specify an individual calendar (when there are multiple) from a specific band when we are creating a widget. Thank you, developers!",
            "This is a excellent app. I was able to listen enjoy and be a part of a church service that was active. Thank you Pastor Rodrick Reeve of New Creation family worship center. Also the staff and congregation. Love the way it works. I will tell others how good it is. Thanks.🤩",
            "Perhaps the best application to manage a sports team activities and keep everyone coordinated and on the same page. Same is true for the recording project, as it is a platform to have all the materials shared and updated between the participants."

            "It definitely makes an anxiety attack not as severe. I wish there was more than just breathing exercises, like maybe some progressive muscle relaxation or something like that, but the calming music is really helpful. Its helped me be able to practice breathing techniques without the app.",
            "Easy and effective. Starts right away and asks you how you're feeling to adjust accordingly.",
            "I literally JUST had a panic attack and this app got me through it soooooo well! Thank you so much for making this app and also thanks for not having ads. I know you can't die from panic attacks but it sure does feel like it, and this app did an amazing job on helping me with me breathing! I don't know what else to say! If anyone is looking for a good app to help you through your panic attacks, this is the app! Again, thanks so much for this app! You're an amazing human being for making this app",
            "I just used this app for the first time and it's absolutely fantastic! I have anxiety and am trying to work on my breathing. My son and daughter have Aspergers syndrome and I am going to suggest it for them too. Because it's so visual...I feel positive that it will work to calm them too. Thank you so much.",
            "I'd like a longer or different one. i think a few more selections make it easy to know which exercise to use for the proper moment. each attack is different at times. it started to work but the short length for me was the only downfall. i will keep it and see how it progresses."

            "I don't get notifications at all anymore. It's annoying since I have to go on the app very 15mins to check if i have any messages, and it also sometimes doesn't even send despite having a good connection. Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",
            "I rarely get notifications of a new message. Messages are left on \"S\" despite having perfect cullar and wifi connection on both ends. Kin market no longer updates. Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",
            "Good if you know what your looking for in an existing group chat or want too make your own. The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",
            "What's up with this chat limit thing? I tried to delete the cache, i stoped the app several times. I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",
            "This app is not what it used to be. The sheer amount of bots have really ruined the experience. Remove one and 2 or 3 more flood in right behind them. I report each and every one of them but I suspect nothing is really being done about it, which is a shame because this used to be my favourite app."

            "I absolutely love this app! Moving away from the big tech companies is doing this human really good!! I don't like to be influenced in my advertising or my feeds. Nobody gets to manipulate me! every time I search I get exactly what I'm looking for and even more articles than Google would have ever provided! The best part is it's private! Nobody's sharing my information! Tell your friends take control of your life!!",
            "I've been using this for quite awhile now & have made it my default browser. I love the privacy aspect- especially now that we're in the middle of the election. I don't get the SPAM emails that I do if I use the typical Android browsers. DDG has all of the functionality that other browsers do but the best one is being able to delete my browsing data without a trace, & it auto blocks cookies( which media & shopping sites don't like, but I think it's great.) It's also very user friendly.",
            "I've been using this browser for 1 1/2 years with no problems until 2 weeks ago. When I tried to login to a site I use regularly I got a message saying it doesn't support Safari 4 and I keep getting this message since then. I could use chrome, but I don't want to. I sent 2 emails to the developers last week. They haven't replied. Disappointing! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't solve the problem. If I had gotten a reply from technical support I would have rated it a 5.",
            "All it really needs is a built in ad blocker and it would be the best private browser you'll ever really find. Its speed makes it an amazing \"default\" browser for quick use, and the ability for it to automatically erase your data after a period of inactivity is priceless! But until it can block ads, I still have to primarily use other browsers for YouTube and leisure browsing. Without that important function (which is a basic standard today), it still falls under a very niche browser.",
            "Wowser Browser! DDG allows me options that none of the others do. For example, it allows copy & paste a host of things with ease much like Chrome without the peeking over your shoulder cookie monsters. It isn't such a hassle to save your favorite/ most visited sites. Sounds simple enough. But to my frustration with the exception of a few browsers, you have to literally manually save a site that you just want the browser to open up to automatically. I love DDG!"

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

And none of the ads are skippable. I once replayed a level and got an ad while I was getting shot at. The game did not pause while the ad played.",
            "I played this game once in 2019. I unlocked many classes like sapper ,marauder. Now I reinstalled it but I can't retrieve the data from the previous attempt. I logged in with the Google play account today but can't load the previous progress , I also checked the Google play account it still shows I made some 14 achievements.",
            "Gameloft should be shivering with embarrassement at this failure of a game and someone needs to be fired. The disrepect they show to the players is unreal. The game is overrun with cheaters who stand outside the maps and kill everyone. Turrets still fire through walls. Every other game is filled with players who stand still but you can't shoot them but they shoot you. This game is unplayable and the european staff responsible should be fired. Scum, just scum.",
            "I Installed this game after around 1 year, i thought this game is not p2w anymore but i was wrong this game is still filled heavily with p2w stuff, matchmaking system sucks, take my advice go ahead for call of duty mobile, there is no mean to play greedy gameloft's games where activision is giving you console like f2p games Really disappointed of gameloft",
            "The graphics are fairly good, and so as the story line but there is a major issue that is server. I could barely play a complete match before it says network lost even when I have Wifi router connection. I don't think it's network issue may be it's your server issues..."

            "Only 3 stars because I quite enjoy the game, there are alot of ads which I can deal with however you dont get enough lives so you're basically waiting and hoping that the other player hasnt put their phone down so you can play for longer than 5 minutes. My suggestion is either add more lives, or cut down the time to wait for lives. If its going to be a half hour wait to get 1 life, it's not worth my time when I use all 3 in 5-10 minutes.",
            "This is a super great innovative game. I love it. I have always loved the paper version, but to find an app version, this is great. Thank you developers and all who worked hard to make this app possible- From the little guys who are hardly recognized to the CEO or whatever you call your top people.",
            "The game itself is fun! It would be great to have a way to leave comments to your opponent. Some people leave hilarious answers. But the ads are offensive and obnoxious. I understand the need to have ads to support the business, and that I could just pay $3 to remove them. Just beware if your kids want to download it, some of the ads are Rated R.",
            "I REALLY love this game. It's super fast paced, makes me think and I really enjoy the premise of it. However the ads are absolutely terrible. They are constant and long and I know I will soon stop playing the game because of it",
            "The game is fun but very repetitive but it's whatever. I hate how many ads there are and the amount of time they need to run before you can exit out from them."

They could have just charged for new additions or at least give you a lifetime purchase of the app so everything is always free afterwards, im not buying credits to buy sounds in a free app.",

Tonics are rich, vibrant and stimulating without being distracting. The integration of so many therapeutic techniques into a seamless whole really makes this app unique.  I use this app when I work on my research, meditate, and to get energized in the morning. I highly recommend it!",
            "Wow. this program is the BEST binaural app I have found. It doesnt stop with binaurals either. I really am blown away. I dont know what the person was talking about in another review this is not cheap generated music at all. I find the program to have a simple clean interface just an amazing app overall. Just one request. What if my phone changes how do i get my purchased tonics back? Also will there be more tonics OR can you suggest a tonic to help me quit smoking. THANK YOU so much!"

I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

HelloMind helps you take back control from negative emotions, cravings, fears and bad habits and it can improve your motivation and enjoyment of life. \r\n\r\n\r\nLow self-esteem, stress, fear, bad sleep and unhealthy habits sometimes hold us back in life and prevent us from enjoying things to the fullest. \r\nThe good news is these negative patterns can be broken or eliminated. \r\n\r\nWe created the HelloMind app to help you make a change. We want you to be able to think better and feel stronger anywhere, any time without having to spend a lot of time and money on treatment. \r\n\r\nThe key to happiness lies within you, and HelloMind works because you are making the change yourself. \r\n\r\nChoose a treatment with 10 sessions if you want help to remove or change something like a craving, a habit or a fear. Each session takes about 30 minutes, and your series of 10 sessions should be completed within about 30 days.\r\n\r\nChoose a Booster if you’d like to reinforce good emotions boost motivation or strengthen a certain area of yourself.\r\n\r\nHelloMind uses a method called RDH - Result Driven Hypnosis, a form of guided hypnosis.\r\n\r\nRDH is especially effective because it helps you go to the root cause of your problem. The theory behind it says that when you’re consciously able to define the problem, your subconscious can find the solution. That’s why you’re gently guided into your subconscious towards the root of your problem then given the tool to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe ten sessions in a treatment or the sessions in a Booster are variations on the same theme, so you’ll hear something different every time you listen. But listening to all 10 sessions in treatment is the only way to ensure that you go deep enough into your subconscious to discover the root of the problem. Every time you listen, you’ll feel a little more safe, because the process is underway and you’ve become accustomed to it. That’s why you relax more as the hypnosis stages become more profound.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing a hypnotherapy treatment, you should always begin with your main problem. The app will guide you to the right treatment or Booster with simple questions. Choosing the right treatment is actually an important part of the process. When you can consciously define the problem, your subconscious will identify the solution.\r\n\r\nTry the Sleep Boosters:\r\n- Have a good night’s sleep\r\n- Sleep more peacefully\r\n\r\nOr boost your confidence with the sessions:\r\n- Have more confidence\r\n- Improve your self-worth\r\n- Become self-confident\r\n\r\nOr kick that anxiety for good with sessions like:\r\n- Be more calm\r\n- Get rid of your fear of panicking\r\n- My ability to de-stress\r\n\r\nOr get rid of your phobia related to:\r\n- Spiders\r\n- Dentists\r\n- Enclosed spaces\r\n\r\nRECENT AWARDS & RECOGNITIONS\r\n** Finalist (Mental Health category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019\r\n** Finalist (Consumer Wellness & Prevention category) ** — UCSF Digital Health awards 2019",

            "I have found this approach to hypnotherapy is very sound and trustworthy. Having done live hypnotherapy over a number of years, using the sessions as designed on this app gives comparable results. Thank you. The subscription fee for a whole year (that incudes all courses and sessions) costs less than one face to face session, and that alone is worth the investment imo. Wonderful and very helpful.",
            "I have been using this app daily for months now, and its really such a gem ! I would recommend everyone to do it. Such a healthy way to check in on yourself, and a really accessible way to self care and a strong support of a happy and sincere inner growth❤",
            "Not a good meditative app. The guide for the meditation speak so fast that it doesnt give the time to apply that and relax.",
            "Can be effective if you're in the right mindset and give it a few tries before assuming it \"isn't working\". I also like how you're able to choose precise topics/issues. That said, every session topic seems to be more/less identical",
            "Meditation and other meditation apps never worked for me but this has improved my self-esteem and confidence that I never thought I had. The results have been noticeable and I've been praised by my workmates because it helped me improve my job performance anxiety.   Pity it's so expensive after the trial and it's not on Chromebook or computer."

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "The app is good, I can communicate with other fans and my idols but the main problem is notifications 😶I don't know when my idol post something or comment on someone's post. Normally everyone gets notifications but I don't at all. Secondly the translation; it's very bad. It misinterprets what people post a lot like all the time. So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand 😐 cause of the translator. Please fix these issues 🙂",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "Skeptical before downloading because of all the negative reviews mostly based off excessive ads - despite enjoying the first version years ago. However, this FREE game delivers exactly what it describes. Yes, when you don't answer a question correctly an add does appear, but so be it? It's a trivia game - an add is a fair trade for incorrectly answering a question. Great game if you aren't too impatient to watch an add everytime you don't know the right answer.",
            "This game is fun, but on Rescue Rush you can only do a catagory for so long. So I would appreciate if you could change that to where you can do the catagory until you want to change it. Also, can you please add more catagories on the rescue rush game? There are also too many adds... other than that this game is really fun and I would recommend you to get it😊",
            "Get rid of the 3 part ads that require you to continously hit continue just to get out of them its b.s.! Also, I am loving the fact you shove ads in my face every 2 minutes but, somehow when I try to watch an ad on purpose somehow they are not available all of the sudden. My interest is waning.",
            "On Pixel 2 with Android 11. When I start the app, enter my email, I see the input for my password. I click on it, but my keyboard doesn't pop up. This is a bug that should be fixed. I have encountered this in two phones, both using Android 11.",
            "You give the same consistent answer every time someone mentions TOO MANY ADS in their comments or ratings on this game. I do enjoy the game itself. Definitely tests your knowledge but there's an ad for literally every single feature and that's probably the most annoying thing ever with any kind of game. This could be the best game ever and I'd spend all my free time playing ACCEPT the ads being there, trumps all of that. Sad really!!"

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

It is usually the feared possibility of the consequences of an action that brings about anxiety. The people who get anxious are always worrying about the bad things that might happen and thus create an environment of fear in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nin this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nDealing with depression\r\nFight Depression Naturally\r\nhow to deal with depression\r\nhow to overcome depression\r\nhow to deal with stress\r\nhow to deal with anger\r\nhow to deal with anxiety\r\ndealing with anxiety\r\nhow to deal with a breakup\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about How to Overcome Anxiety \r\n\r\nIf you want to know how to overcome anxiety, you must be quick to notice what wrong with you and what you need to do to correct it.\r\n\r\nIt is wise you quickly learn how to overcome anxiety now otherwise you will continue to feel stressed, unhappy and anxious throughout your life. You will suffer unduly because anxiety will weaken you mentally, sap your energy and you will not be at your best. Anxiety comes in many forms. Some suffer from panic disorder where there are unpredictable attacks of panic on the person, with its physiological consequences, while some others feel helpless in an embarrassing situation and this is agoraphobia. There are also others suffering from various other phobias like fear of heights, insects and water. Some feel that they are always watched by others, and thus suffer from social anxiety disorder. People who have undergone some traumatic event in their past suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Some people perform repeated and ritualistic behaviors to rid themselves of obsessive compulsive disorders and the most common form of anxiety is generalized anxiety disorder. These people are usually over anxious of a situation and may end up in some major depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, anxiety comes in many forms, and the first step to be taken in the treatment of anxiety lies in finding out what the cause is. Once the reason of the anxiety has been found out, it proves to be rather easy to cure anxiety. It is best to avoid these situations as much as possible in the beginning of your treatment so that there is no feeling of anxiety at all.\r\n\r\nIt may be needed to approach a psychiatrist to help in the treatment of anxiety. Under their guidance, you learn to handle anxiety attacks in three steps; before, during and after the anxiety attack.\r\n\r\nA person who suffers from anxiety should not set self-defeating goals. It is instead better to set productive and possible goals that improve one's thought and action. With this step, the patient learns to gain better control over oneself and thus overcome anxiety. When suffering from a bout of anxiety, it is better to calm oneself naturally rather than trying to fight or control one's anxious feelings.\r\n\r\nSomeone with anxiety should work at producing positive thoughts in the mind. Once pessimistic or unpleasant thoughts enter the mind, it is better to divert oneself and think of other situations with vivid, optimistic pictures. If possible, it proves to be better to think positive thought of these pessimistic thoughts, using objective words.",

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "The \"Hit List\" category has the same 5 songs in a row every time and then just crashes and says \"something went wrong\" literally every single time you try to get past the first 5 questions. This is obviously something wrong with the app, but no one seems to care much about trying to fix it..",
            "Well, to me I think that its a very fun app but it always kicks me out of the challenge and you can't play it without wifi. And if you are thinking about your child to play this game well thats fine with you but with me I don't think that its ok because some of the songs have cuss words but thats just me.",
            "This app leaves a residual file on your phone that, even after the app is uninstalled, continues to access the internet. This causes the firewall on the device to send a push notification/warning. Very shady.",
            "So far, it's challenging since I don't know all the music from all the decades you have. Would enjoy more if you put in music from the 30's, 40's and 50's. I'd think you would get more people enjoying this app.",
            "Good, but has a major bug. The highest level can only be achieve if played in that category for consecutive days. I have tried various times and the final level is still not unlocked. Overall fun and the 2 player works well."

            "Sicko app for beginners in the game. It keeps getting better too. Its not too complicated, if i wanted to do it in the studio, I would. I'd have to pay thousands of dollars too! Squash that, this is that new normal, that next paradigm. So let me drop a dime, in the phone(cellular). I made this song in one night, during a fight, between me and my wife. I didn't have any time, but it came out sublime, wife'ys calling it a crime, gold it glows, but silver it shines, 9 times. Outta ten..zen",
            "This app rewards people for copying and singing over other artists vocals. It also rewards the same 10 - 15 people every week. Admin don't reply to queries and they also don't stick to the rules. The same rules they expect their users to stick to. If you make your own cover art and mix your own tracks Its like you're less likely to be rewarded. They also judge tracks even tho they don't make music which means they don't even know what it takes to make tracks.",
            "Not bad! I like the concept of the app and it's pretty dope. Wish there were more functions. I've been waiting to relaunch my YouTube channel and music too so this was a pretty good idea to start networking. Try it out. They have samples and demos and easy to use",
            "I love this app but right now its giving me a hard time trying to use special features like I usually would it does not even let me see the words at the bottom to apply it... whats going on with the app??? And yes I am a Suscribed member for the year.",
            "The app is decent, still room for improvement though. How about adding a info bar so the producers can give details about the song structure, bpm, and instrumental etc? I have been wanting to write songs for the longest, but without that info i cannot do it."

And in tournament's I havent gotten my gene points so now I'm short by like 20+ and I cant seem to progress much farther without them. Please fix so I can continue to enjoy the game. Other than that the game will go to 5 star if fixed... please",
            "The ads don't always work right, and there's a lot of ads to view... they try to reward you for them proportionally but it still takes you away from the game. Now on my new phone, a Google pixel 4a, it keeps crashing",
            "I once loved this game but then I accidentally deleted it a long time ago and I forgot the name. But now I'm back and there are new updates and that's why I wanna check them out. I really love this game keep updating it it's coming handy.",
            "This game is awesome! I was playing it then suddenly a gold ray appeared! I was shocked.I played it and I reached almost 1300 meters.dont listen to who gived 1 star 🌟.I almost download this game for 6 times.but this game is awesome!!!!!!.",
            "This is one of the best games I have ever played! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! I like the new updates and It has helped me a lot in earning pearls and coins. The events and global matches are great. I can now get various new and exciting rewards by progression and many more. The graphics and gameplay are smooth and it eases my mind when I play this game."

            "Love it but I think you should add button to go to the continued. And a button so that you can pick different types of storys like funny and weird story's. I recommend this because when your reading a story adds dont show when you hit next. And its 100 percent free to by and to look at the pics. Last the piks dont mach with the story,like when a pik of a bath room vent, it showed a creepy vent but its still a vary good game 😍😍😍😍😍",
            "So, the story's are great! You can pick from them. The norms these sorts of apps need, Its has. The photos are free too look at!! But one thing that could be added is that the photos I have to load it once then reload it to see it. Overall though! It deserves a 5 star so that's what it gets!!",
            "I LOVE THIS! Its So Good, Because You Dont Have To Wait, And You Don't Have To Pay, Either! All You Have To Do Is Tap Install, And You Can Read Millions Of Stories! And You Can Also Just Watch Ads To Show Pictures, Instead Of Paying! This Is The Best Story App, Hit Install, Instantly Addicted, Read, Read, Read! I Reccomend This App To People Who Love Reading Stories, And Like Spooky Topics, Romantic Topics, And More! My Final Report Is: If I Could Give This A 10 / 20 Star, I Would! :)",
            "I think this app is absolutely AMAZING! Whether you like Scary, Romance, or funny stories they are all there! They can swear sometimes so be aware but I totally recommend this app! Even the scary stories have rankings! Creepy is a bit scary, Scary is quite scary, and just the word 'Horror' Is very scary! Go and download it right away! One if the best things is that nothing costs money! Not even the photos! Go and install it now! 👍👍👍",
            "I really like it, it really creeps me out, but their is a problem with the pictures. The pictures and the text don't really get along. And I hope the stories could be more scary and intense or maybe just give it a little twist. I hope this review helps your app be more entertaining and the stories to be more exciting to ready. :) I hope this helps."

All the sounds from the videos I gathered together can be heard over the music I chose and there's no option to stop this! This is very frustrating and I do hope this can be fixed, causee y'all could loose so much with this problem",

I'm having issues where I just can't make an edit because when I'm editing for a certain amount of minutes it just logs me off and makes me do everything again. I had everything done which took forever and then for some stupid reason it just made me restart AGAIN. ALL MY PROGRESS GONE. FIX YOUR APP NOW!",
            "I really loved this app for editing but now when I go to edit my videos it only gets me so far before starting me from the beginning... so frustrating... thanks a lot Lomotif.. you literally gotten me no where even since I've updated it its still glitching... please fix it.",
            "It's always crashing, I never get to finish editing and exporting my videos. If I got the chance to, it's because I had to, in fear of it freezing. Usually even if I export, it's not ewhat I want. You guys should fix this cause it actually seems like a great app",
            "I could have chosen half star if I could. This app is so annoying, it's honestly cool when you create your photo videos and it has cool music's but why does it always when it's time to export.. it will just be in 0percent for hours. I've installed it many times but still same problem.. very annoying 😖😖😖"

            "Useless. GPS tracking does not work, tried everything, app usually gets stuck on loading, the features are not user friendly, very limited, very clunky. It's a really slow, limited and badly designed app with inadequate features .",
            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",
            "I'm not very happy that Norton does not provide coverage for Microsoft Explorer. Also if you add a website to the unblocked list they are not unblocked immediately. They have a few kinks to work out for me."

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "This app is super cool! You get to make lots of cool videos but... If you wanted to save them you have to pay. Like 4.99 and 10.99 or 35.99$ for some people that can be alot and that's just if you want TO SAVE the video YOU MADE. But there is some really cool templates. But I really wish I could of given this app a 5 star or at least a 4 star but no I had to give it a 3 stars. :(",
            "This app is great! It exports your videos very quickly, but I'm giving this a 4 star review because it doesn't really let you pick the music you want, it already gives you music with a type of style. Then again, this app is amazing and doesn't cost money to do the videos, so great job :)",
            "I just downloaded this app and it seems pretty cool and fun but it's already having some issues and it's only been five minutes. I picked out a few photos for a video and after pushing play the music in the video started skipping right away it only played part of it then kicked me out.",
            "This truly is a great app I realised that you don't exactly have to pay for everything even though there is a pro option it's perfectly fine because you don't have to pay for it and a lot of the templates are actually just for Free really good and you can remove the watermark too",
            "Extreamly beautiful app i have ever seen before for beat edting... But i suggest please add the favourite option in which users can add their favorite templates. And search option As well. Such an amazing Application. 😘😍 Thank you"

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "I used to love this game but since the latest update released on 29 October, the beam shot no longer works properly. It is only destroying the bubbles you can see on the screen and not to the top.",
            "It's a good game for a while. After a bit, though, it gets to the point where the levels are too hard to beat without 4 or 5 tries. There's no way to lessen or in any way control the difficulty level. It would be nice if there were a way to choose your difficulty level that you wanted to play each day. This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",

I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors. The balls with the \"-\" are annoying. On the first level with it it's impossible not to pop especially with blaster. Also the previous issues have not been fixed."

While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",

            "Game itself is good, but customers service and support is total zero. T4f only need your money and that's all. You'll never get support from them if anything happens in the game. Someone hack my account that i spent goo few ££ on it and totally destroyed. I've got in touch with customer service straight after someone logged in from different device and asked for help so they block them, unfortunately they reply 3days later when everything was destroyed and told me \"sorry comma,we can't help you\"",
            "This is a great game. I am having issues that has been going on for a long time. It looks like they tried to resolve the issues but it still exist. I have 4 different profiles and for all four, any talent points I acquired, the game doesn't allow me to use them.",
            "Its hard to play game specially REFT of LEGEND, the events unbalance the player during matching. Other events is good, the concern is adjast the research time of all research so that weak can balance to the strongeist and so for the player spend money to become strong.",
            "I like the game. It's not hard to play. Also you don't need to get powerful. I've been playing for a few days and my ranking is number one. That's amazing.",

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "Simply impressed !! You guys out did yourselves, fantasic storyline with a dark undertone. Beautiful and haunting music, coupled with detailed and beautiful artwork. Loved the backstory and graphics, including the CGI animation. Good work on how the evidence board was compiled to move the story along with the prisoner, nothing was boring. Nice puzzles and hidden object scenes. Had fun, keep'em coming.",
            "I love the game but I hate how I now have to pay for it like why I had completed most of the game before and now you have to pay to continue the game. I had the game on another device",
            "This game is amazing and extremely exciting/interesting, but it would be a lot better if the entire gameplay could be unlocked for free instead of just an intro.",
            "Downloaded this as I remember liking the original a long time ago. It didn't give me enough time to even refresh my memory, before the demo was over with a request for my money!! Am deleting it as we speak and will NOT be downloading any of their games in the future! One very dissatisfied customer."

Your backed into a corner.....stay away from it ! If your card is declined by their system your screwed unless you have another card There is no option to back out. Just use the normal app or website. This isn't phising...my account is banned cos my credit card isn't apparently supported by yourselves.!",

After your latest update all bugs have emerged. 1st of all im using your mobile app, everytime i enter a chat room and pick up a user to view, i have to always reload their cam and its inconvenient and very annoying. 2nd, the mic. I cant seem to mute it permanently if i want to, and the name of the dj (whoever they are) are reflected on the bottom screen of the app. That was very unpleasant to see and always annoying. Please fix the app asap i like using it. Thanks",

When I try to go on to this app and press open 1 through 10 I had tried all of them and it would switch me over into an ad which they were all for Penn state and then it would say it could not open the file so either this app is a hoax just trying to get all my information or something was seriously wrong because I do believe I'm updated and everything :( So sad because I was really looking forward to learning about this subject & more about myself too!!",
            "so far so good. I'm disappointed it is an ebook. I would live to be able to open it in audible so I could listen on my hour long commute. maybe an option for an update? even a computerized reader would be nice. thanks!",

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

Otherwise a normal person will not buy from your app bcoz its wasting of money on buying suxh expensive cloths.. And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",

            "Great app for Japanese basics! However, some words are mistranslated slightly. For example, (I don't have a japanese keyboard so just bare with me.) \"Douzo,\" doesn't mean please, it means \"here you go\". Who, what, when, where, and how are also slightly mistranslated. For example, \"what\" would be \"nani,\" but the app says what means \"nan desu ka,\" which actually translates to \"what is...\" Do not reccommend if you are a beginner learner. Search up correct definitions if you used this app :)",
            "I would buy it if the \"phonetic\" setting could be fumaji and not just romaji. It really slows your progress reading roman characters. This is especially true when learning from an app, since the writing element is removed. Therefore, the app has limited value for me.",
            "Some annoying ads that pop up, which i can thankfully back out of, but its a very lovely app that has simple phrases to familiarize when you're learning japanese or when you plan to visit Japan and need simple phrases to get you by!",
            "I have no idea how accurate these are, but the presentation is streamlined. I've been through 5 sections,and the phrases seem to fit well. the male audio is very clear, extremely well recorded.",
            "During use will show 30+ seconds long full screen unstoppable ads, so cannot be used while actually communicating with others. Still useful while practicing when on your own hence why 2* stars."

        "description": "If you’re an introvert, then you know that your natural instincts don’t motivate you to go and socialize with people. However, you still love to spend some time with others when it’s appropriate — and love to have great friends in your circle. Introverts don’t like to socialize too much, but also hate to be lonely. Read on to discover three strategies that will help you be more social as an introvert.\r\n\r\nHere’s the simple truth: You can’t be financially or professionally successful without superior social skills. Fortunately becoming more social doesn’t have to be difficult or take years to master. \r\n\r\nWhen guys start looking for information on how to become social they don’t always like what they find.

But learning how to become social doesn’t have to be like that.\r\n\r\nBeing social and being a more authentic, happier person go hand and hand.  Why?  Because being social is our natural state.  Ever notice how fearless little kids are in social situations?  They’re not worried about how they come across and are not afraid to interact with strangers.\r\n\r\nBut as we grow up insecurities develop and we’re told how we’re supposed to act.  This snowballs over the years and next thing you know being social becomes difficult.  So we have to re-learn how to become social.\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to learn how to be social without adding on layers to your personality that make you feel fake, we’ve got you covered.
