This valuable new tool provides inspiring stories to help you reach the finish line each day, and whether you prefer to read or listen - daily coaching is a great way to kickstart your day with inspiration.",
        "comments": [
            "It's a good app, but the alarms aren't as customizable as I'd like, and some of the elements are a little confusing. It took me way too long to figure out how to delete and reorder things, it's not as intuitive as HabitRPG. That being said, it's nice to have a community to participate with- or not. Either way is acceptable, and no feeling left out or pushed in. Useful tool for helping serious change, one day at a time.",
            "This app is amazing, but geared heavily towards women. As a person trying to build a more masculine frame and personality using this app seems a little bit counterproductive to my goals. In my opinion, this app would receive a 5-star rating and high praise if it were gender-neutral. Over all, a very good app. Clean interface, detailed, motivatinf, and easy to use.",
            "It's a really sleek and informative app. I'm just on the trial bit so far so good :-) I wanted to add - after two years of using this app, I am finally beginning to live the life I know I deserve and have worked so hard to achieve. The Fabulous has been an invaluable tool in helping me stay focused and achieve goals one step at a time. Thank you so much ❤️",
            "This app has given me space to do something just for me, which as a new mom can be tricky! I really like the journeys and goals and habits, but I find that the interface isn't super user friendly and I often find features by accident and then have no idea how to get back to them. Maybe I need to play around more, but it would be nice if there were less hidden nooks and crannies, so to speak. Overall, love it and am so thankful for it!",
            "I uninstalled this app from my phone recently, then found that I had paif £45.99 for a year's premium at 50% discount. I have no recollection of this....... but no proof either. I've just cancelled all pre-approved payments on Paypal to avoid anything like that happening again. In the meantime, I've got use of the app for another 12 months and so might as well use it. It's not worked brilliantly for me - it's basically a habit tracker."

And plus the the quotes are very motivational and true. I love it! The reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is a lot of stuff not worth paying for that much for the premium thing. And I feel like there is too many features locked for premium that I can't do anything.",
            "I love this app. My favourite thing is that it gives you a routine based on your mood. Its great for if you feel a bit down too and you can see your progress in happiness. In July I had saved mine as \"stressed because of school\" and now I'm happier than ever! Defo recommend 5☆ from me!",
            "Reflectly is such a great app! You can add multiple moods and activities for each day, there are also quotes, you can choose what quote style you want for different things you are struggling with or things you just need to hear. I highly recommend this app!",
            "Really terrible experience. I applied for account.paid 1 months fee, completed stupid tutorial and before email creation hit back. Because I don't want to create this account. And now I'm stuck on trial account, but I lost 1 months fee. I'm totally disappointed. Stupid tutorial, stupid app, stupid idea! Return my money!!!",

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

The tools the app uses to relieve anxiety are varied and appropriate to a variety of people.

All this combines with a colorful, almost whimsical user interface that is simultaneously easy to navigate and visually appealing and calming.",

The notification just disappears.",

EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves.

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "Pretty useful app, I like the way everything is organized, presenting the statistics is easy and intuitive. There is Bluetooth compatibility with my glucometer and that makes is really easy to pass my measurements to the app. The user interface is easy and the app is polished in general. Good job.",
            "Almost perfect app for diabetic users. Over all this is a very good program to keep track of your blood sugar, BP, weight, etc... Works fine on Android 8 and 9 with Huawei Mate 10 Pro and Mate 20 Pro. The only problem which I found on Android 9 pie is that fordiabetes Continuously scans for Bluetooth in background.Looks like when you exit app app stay opened in background. Sometimes app don't sync with my Contour Next One no matter that I try also manually to sync my reading on Contour. But most important for me is they have great support. You send mail to support team and you receive answer almost immediately no matter is the working day or not. The best support I seen over last years. On Progress page you can see Weekly and Monthly Average but not Yearly or at least 3 month Average which is important for HbA1c. Statistic can be better. Today the most important things are statistical data. From those data we can see our progress.  Till today I tried many diabetes app but this one is almost perfect. Keep going on this way, you do very good job. Sorry for my English. It is not so perfect like your app.",
            "The app helped me track down my measurements corellated to my diabetes. Really helpfull seeing my progress since downloading the app",
            "Really helped me balance my blood sugar levels. Pretty useful app.",
            "Overall a smooth good looking app. However it's disappointing the Google sync is to sync activities instead of also syncing blood pressure or glucose via custom data type."

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it. I love that there are so many resources in one app. It's simple to use and it keeps me motivated to stay on top of my feelings and manage my environment."

I feel very lucky, more optimistic creating daily habit of journaling with premium features.. Really love the visuals, simple yet elegant and artistic.. Keep up the good work! I hope I don't have any issues about data backup..",
            "I just downloaded the app and its really good, i really like how you can write all your thoughts and feelings. However, there are some negative things about this app. I wanted to add a passcode to the app so that no one can see all my thoughts and diaries, but it said that i had to pay. I don't think that is fair because i dont have the money to pay and it could be thesame for many other people and keeping your thoughts private on this app should be for free. Other than that, the app is good.",

            "Honestly, this app helped me. A lot. Even though I'm still on the free one, the app helps me to track my condition. With the questions and insight, I feel like I get to to know how I am a little better. The article are easy to understand. Last but not least, kudos to the developer to actually answering my email for help :) thank you. One problem that I got earlier is that sometimes I wrote my journals pretty long, but it didn't saved. But nowadays they're more likely to me saved. I'm loving it.",
            "For me, at this point of my bettering my mental health, the journalling function is the most useful function for me. Occasionally I do read a bit of the learning content which is also beneficial. The journaling function would be easier to use if the plus button was also accessible from the current day. It took me a moment to figure out that if I went to a previous day I could then edit the day to make an additional entry for today. Also some of the content needs further clarification.",
            "Not for Women, but better than nothing...? The app does not let you identify health markers in your profile, like biological sex. Mental health triggers, stimulus, and treatment vary wildly by sex and age, and this app doesn't track or separate that information. As such, your advice and coaching will be given to you as if you were a male of average age. So take it with a grain of salt. The app itself is clean and easy to use. It's just not all that helpful.",
            "A very helpful tool. I've been usng it for over a year and a half. However, I can't use it since the update. My internet is fine, but every time I get on the app, it says a connection isn't possible. I will turn my wi-fi off and back on, and all my other apps work fine. However, this app won't work. It's been a few days now, and the same thing happens. Please fix this soon",
            "This app is really helpful, and I really enjoy tracking how I've been feeling, but the new UI design is awful. It makes it so much harder to find and tag emotions. On the small list, there were only a few negative tags and the other, larger list was so unorganized! It made it annoying to find a tag I wanted. It wasn't even in alphabetical order! Still a great app, but the previous design was much, much better."

            "It worked just fine at first, but now sometimes the app doesn't track the time. For example, I've been working for 1 hour from 9-10 am but when I use the app, it says \"What have you been up to the last 30 minutes?\" It only tracks 9.30-10.00 am, and the data at 9.00-9.30 am becomes empty with no way to input it. I also hope you can improve the statistics, I wish to see what I did exactly 2 days ago, or 3 days ago, etc instead of just \"yesterday\" or \"last 7 days\".",
            "Update. Unfortunately I need to uninstall the app as its clearly abandoned. Developer not responding to comments or emails. The app needs updating. It's not working on Android 10. It's a good app but needs some additional features and more regular updates. For example, there's no backup option. I wouldn't mind paying. The developer does not reply to reviews nor to emails. Probably it is abandoned at the moment. Thanks for the free app anyway.",
            "This would have been absolutely the perfect time tracker, except the background time tracking is not always accurate and you're NOT able to edit the time of activities (why not?), which is unfortunately a deal breaker. Edit: thanks for the response, but the only thing I can edit on the stat page is the activity, not the time/duration, which is what i was referring to. unless I missed something. Edit: super responsive dev, upgraded to 5 stars. awaiting update!",
            "Exactly what I needed! I can log my activities every time I unlock my phone. App is completely free, so you are not limited with number of activities or types. You can setup how many you want. There are more additional features like editing logged activity, exporting to .csv, show values in graphs etc. 10/10 would recommend to everybody, who wants to track their spent-time.",
            "I really like this app. I just wish that I could export the data. I also really like it being on my Lockheed screen to remind me, but in that mode it actually keeps my screen unlocked all the time so sometimes my kids mess the records up & then get into other apps. Also if you accidentally erase you can't go back & put in a new entry for that time. really it's pretty good & the ads aren't intrusive."

            "Best app for planning out there. Only 2 suggestions: 1. I prefer to edit times on the schedule planner by resizing, if I forget to choose \"All Instances\" when moving or resizing I can not undo my change. It is stuck as an exception unless I delete it or change it on a different day and select \"All Instances\". Please add a \"Apply Exception to All Instances\" button. 2. Select and move multiple scheduled events around on the scheduler. For example, if you woke up late you push it forward a bit.",
            "This one of the best planners, it has a unique design and approach to planning. I love option of categories. What I disliked is that repeat option for events is limited. For example, I can't schedule some event on only workdays, I have to schedule it to repeat every day. Fix that and amazing app for everyday use! Edit: Turns out I didn't click where I was supposed to, thank you for your response! 5 stars from me!",
            "This is a wonderful app and for someone who loves customization, this one really provides a lot of scope. Exploring the app was enjoyable in itself. I do have one urgent request which would make me want to buy the pro version. Currently, there is no way to see the logged activity for the day in the form of a hourly breakup (similar to the scheduled activities screen). I would really like to be able to have a glance at my day and see what all I've done instead of just seeing a pie chart. Please?",
            "It's a bit complicated and slow to set up at first, but it really is an amazing app for planning your day, looking at how you spend your time, and being able to make better use of your time in the future. I have ADHD, and one of my biggest complaints with physical time planners is I can't move things around easily; this lets me move tasks and events around incredibly easily, and has an awesome feature which asks if you want to move the rest of the events for the day accordingly.",
            "Overall it is a very good program and helps me be efficient and motivated. However the overtime logging option keeps resetting to disabled. This bug needs to be corrected because my time logging stops while working on something and then I do not know what time I need to add. I will give 5 stars if this issue is resolved. Upd: I Uninstalled and reinstalled to be sure. I have only one google account and still the overtime setting resets. The app needs debugging."

Even if it's there it's hard to find and it doesn't look like you can see progress or add duration. Also, a dark/night theme would be great. Admittedly, some of the tips/troubleshooting pieces are nice, like suggesting how you might be setting the bar too high.",
            "This app looks FANTASTIC!! I'm so excited I discovered it, and can't wait to try it for myself!!! I'm a highly visual learner, and was wondering if you had an example of your app in use? Or do you have any suggestions, tips, or instructions on how to fully utilize your app? I'll watch for your answer, but in the meantime, I wish you good luck!!😀",
            "I Have Had This App For Less Then 1 Hour, And It's Already Fustrating Me. When I Try To Add Something It Keeps Putting The Date As July 14, 2019! TODAY IS JULY 17, 2019! I Found An Area To Change The Date, I Tried Changing The Date To July 17, 2019, On The Right Hand Corner At The Top It Says Today, And When I Save The Entry, It Goes Back To July 14, 2019. I Tried At Least 5 Times To Change And Fix It Any Way I Can. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS APP HAS A RATING OF A 4.6. WOULD RATE 0 STARS IF I COULD!"

Maybe WhatsApp is not the right platform to use.",

            "Edit: Bumping this up to 5 stars since I was informed that there is a way to edit the times! - So far I love this app. The only thing I would like to see is the ability to edit start/end times for the times tasks. That way if I forget to start it, I can still input it correctly. Otherwise this is a fantastic app, and I'm highly considering purchasing the premium version",
            "Great app! 5 stars if they would add a reset feature on the timers or, more ideally, allow you to select what time your timers reset each day. I stay up late so on some days I don't complete a task until after midnight which makes it count towards the next day. If I want to do that same task when I wake up, the timer is already completed and I have to make a duplicate of that task in order to time the task.",
            "I've been using the app for a short time now, but I gotta say is amazing. There's a thing I've been struggling for a while and is keeping certain taks under a certain amount of time, I get perfectionist and things start taking time from other things. This app has a wonderful approach to time management using time limitis as either goals or limits, which allows me to make sure I am dedicating to each task the time I do want to dedicate. I love it.",
            "Awesome and elegant interface. Easy to use, with history (calendae) to keep track of time. I have a suggestion though, can you please make me register my days missing? I have a streak in Duolingo of 150 days for example and just installed the app today. It would be great if I could check on the days missing. Other apps like Habits have this feature, and yeah, I would like to have all my favorite features in one app. Thank you!",
            "Simple, clean and effective! No ads is a HUGE win! I belong to a goal setting group and have introduced this app to the group - several members are excited to use it. Hoping for a \"to-do list\" feature in the future. Thank you for this app!"

        "title": "No Excuses! The Power of Self-Discipline",
        "description": "No Excuses! The Power of Self-Discipline by Brian Tracy.The book offers 21 ways to achieve self-discipline in all aspects of life, which will improve in the following three main areas: personal success, money, business, sales, and personal life. Through self-mastery and self-control, one can develop more personality, pride, accomplishment, and self-image. One way to achieve self-discipline:\r\n\r\n1. Success: Imagine the ideal life you want to live. When you define what success means to you at the work, family, health and money levels, you'll immediately be able to determine what you need to achieve to achieve the ideal life.\r\n\r\n2. Personality: The hallmark of personality is integrity. Honesty requires a lot of self-discipline to resist temptation and make good decisions. The real personality of one appears during crises or when one is under pressure. One can develop his character through study, teaching and practice.\r\n\r\n3. Responsibility: Negative emotions stem from anger and rely on a human tendency to blame others, which is the easy way to justify failure. Accepting responsibility for self-success and achieving personal happiness requires a lot of effort and self-discipline.\r\n\r\n4. Objectives: Set your goals and set a path to achieve your ideal life. Follow this method to achieve your goals: Select what you want to achieve, write it down on paper, and set a deadline for it. Write down a list of all the actions needed to get to the situation you want sorted by time and importance. Start immediately with these steps, and continue working every day, moving towards your main goal.\r\n\r\n5. Personal Excellence: The most valuable asset you have is you. So one has to invest in himself and his career by developing his skills, so he can increase his value and increase his expected profits. It is important that this development be a priority throughout your life.\r\n\r\n6. Courage: All of us are afraid of something, and most people are afraid of failure and poverty. Self-discipline helps to gain the courage to face problems and crises.\r\n\r\n7. Perseverance: Nothing great is achieved in life without perseverance, which makes us overcome setbacks, frustrations, obstacles and even crises.\r\n\r\n8. Work: Many people waste as amazing time in unproductive tasks. So you need to identify and focus on the most productive activities. A survey of CEOs was conducted and identified two characteristics that are the most important qualities they are looking for in their employees: \"the ability to prioritize and work on high-value tasks\", and \"organization to work quickly and accurately\"",

            "Good app, but all my data was lost when I changed my device. Extremely disappointed. (Edit : So apparently I was supposed to create a JSON backup manually on device 1 and then import it when I switched to device 2. So now all my words are gone. Very crappy system, in case someone gets their phone formatted or loses their phone. Very sad system for such a great app.)",
            "Great app. I really like the grid premise and use of templates for day, week, month, and year. I like far more than a competitor. A couple things I think would make it significantly better: 1) Have a web app 2) Be able to setup a random gratitude question as part of a template. While you can select a random question, very few apply to gratitude.",
            "I love this app! The journal system is revolutionary and helps me journal how I've always longed to. However, twice in the month I've been using it all my journal entries for a day have dissapeared. Once it happened was when I added tags, and another time it happened when I added photos. I updated the app today, so I will edit this review in a week or so if it seems improved. Grid Diary team, I LOVE IT! Thank you!!! I look forward to continuing with this app, thank you for your work on it.",
            "This app is my favourite app yet, even without premium membership it is very much useful my only critique will be that sometimes it stops working, well atleast for me (its stops saving my entries) and i have to delete it and redownload it and then the syncing also erases more of my entries which is quite unfortunate however beggers cant be choosers ...i love it",
            "It's okay as it is. It's just a simple app for journalising, keeping track of the progress of your goals, sticking to good habits, and there's always new generated quotes everyday to help inspire you. It's not an amazing app because there's better apps out there, but it's an okay app. I give it 5 stars for the simplicity."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

The app is updated to the latest versions always. Some sound files are with disturbing backround noises ... like recorded in a office, kitchen or where ever. I would love to use this app but this renders the app useless.",

            "I love having access to All Quests from my phone, i understand is a new app so the team is looking to optimize it. So far i experienced an error on the last remaining sec of lessons. So far so good for me and how i intend to use the app",
            "The content is great, infinit stars for it but would be greate to have a search bar in the app and a section where we can view what we watched and a section with \"continue watching\". Also I have problems too with the last part of the videos and I have the latest version...",

            "I think this is a really great app with awesome features, even for free. I ended up purchasing the upgrade because I enjoyed the app so much in the free version already, and wanted to support the devs. However, I wish there was an option to mass delete records instead of going in 1 by 1, I was exploring the multiday record feature and accidentally gave myself 60 new records, which I had to delete 1 by 1.",
            "Love this application, though it's simple still useful and easy to work with. But... Minus a star for not recognising Cyrillic characters - question marks in report files plus font size is too small for a 10\" screen. Maybe developers don't know that there are users using tablets as well as smartphones. Also it would be nice to have 3 levels - project, its subs and their tasks and statistics for all of them (look at Gleeo Time). Task Start Area is quite narrow, in 95% cases it calls Task Edit.",
            "Neat productivity app, a bit barebones in places and the UI isn't terribly intuitive, but it's simple to learn and very solid once you get the hang of it. I use it to keep track of time spent on different hobbies and it's nice to be able to keep track of time goals for each day and week and see cumulative time spent.",
            "Love love love!!! Best time tracker app Ive tried. Its clean and easy to use. Some suggestions that would make me love it even more would be tobe able to show data for tasks per project.",
            "Great App! I have been using it for a while now and am convinced that it is the best designed time tracking app out there :) What I do miss a little bit is to be able to mark projects as billable so it would make my work life easier. Also I would like to be able to set \"goals\", so I could say I would like to work 8 hours daily, I would get notified when I reached the 8 hours. That would be really cool! :)"

            "I feel like this is a really good app, gives me a little bit of responsibility by waking up my buddy and gets me to go out and do simple but meaningful tasks. It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

            "The questions are VERY interesting and I feel better after answering them. They are not just some random questions, it shows that they have been put a lot of thought in. And that makes me put a lot of thought in answering them. And the feature of locking the app is very useful, since my brother keeps playing with my phone. Also, if you're a teenager like me, I'd highly recommend this app. It really lets you reflect on yourself and makes you think about some very important things. I love it.",
            "LOVE THIS APP. I do it before bed every night. I love the questions, they really make you think and reflect. Its a great app especially if your on a self discovery journey. I try to be as honest and real in my answers.. who knows maybe one day if something ever happened to me, my husband or kids might see this and get to know my inner thoughts and feel connected. ❤",
            "It's nice. The questions let you know more about yourself as you answer them.. I don't know what is the problem, but it has been atleast 3 days, it just shows \"trying to connect to the server\".",
            "The first couple of months I thought the app was amazing. The questions where really interesting, and I would love to see how my opinion changes over the years. Suddenly they started to become really dull, or they assumed you are a childless single person. I like the fact that I can switch to community questions, but it's not enough. And some questions are so badly written. I can understand that some of the community questions lack good grammar, but the official ones should be properly written.",
            "It's a great app for introspection. I am not able to write answers everyday so whenever I open the app, I try to answer 10-15 questions in a go and it feels like I am having a meaningful conversation with someone who really wants to know me. Apparently, I am that someone and this app has helped me so much in reflecting on my true self."

            "Almost perfect... I only wish it had more to do with the \"game\" aspect. It's basically a to-do list or planner. Sure, it gives you some \"gold\" and experience points based on your completed tasks, but they amount to nothing, as there is nothing to do with either once collected. No built-in items to purchase, no character creation or customisation... disappointing. That being said, the tasks are easy to create and customise. I feel more organised than usual. So, thanks, I guess.",
            "This app is very customizable, which I definitely wanted in an RPG style To Do list. However, it does come at a cost, since getting everything set up how you'd like takes much longer than similar apps. Personally I think the trade is worth it (hence my rating), but be aware that if you're looking for something more simple, this probably isnt the app for you. If you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work, pick this one over the others!",
            "Great, but it is missing a feature that honestly has me looking elsewhere. This app would be perfect for me, except that it seems that the app only provides a \"Successful executions\" graph for a given event with a time interval of _one_ week. I'm interested in the tracking of my successful executions of an event over a long period of time, and so not having an option for a graph over a longer timeline is a bit of a bummer.",
            "It really helps with getting things done! Receiving XP, gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do. I like that - on the contrary to other apps - it is actually useful without having to get the premium version. Though the premium version is a nice addition. Suggestion: some rewards could already be existent so you don't have to come up with them yourself. I personally don't have many ideas for coming up with rewards and don't know what gold price would be appropriate.",
            "It would be nice to have the ability to set an xp/coins decay until a particular task is completed. Also, would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time (rather than editing its time and resetting it, or duplicating it). Also, maybe add search ability for filtering icons (as there are so many)."

            "Really Nice... and Cool Features... but for a Price I was excited to start using this app. There have been many times where I get ideas for art projects, and experience feelings that can only be described in the given moment. It's easy to add entries and do quick check-ins multiple times a day and I was psyched to see the other journaling ideas... Until I saw that you have to spend $30/year for those features. So cruel to ad them just to say, \"Pay us! Minus that, I would give it 5 stars.",
            "The app has more intelligent offer than I expected. First, it is a great interface to use on any devices, web, phone, tablet so I'm happy to be able to access it any time. The note is simply minimal and well organized. I'm surprised that there are actually promt checkins and guided templates for different topics for journaling. I'm using more than I intended.",
            "So far so good very simple to use and the design and layout is appealing. Better than most I've tried recently. Option to upload multiple photos in one go rather than individually would be handy, and the ability to upload videos would be nice. Great experience so far though.",
            "it is a really good app, ive only just started using it and is very good compared to other diarys and mood journals ive had in the past. it is good even without the subscription as you have access to the diary feature, mood board and everything. the only reason im giving 4 stars is because i feel that the mood board could be a bit more in depth that just, \"pick a face, what activities made you feel this way, any other notes.\" i feel it needs a little more but it is a great app and i recomend it!",
            "Pay to use... Listen, If you guy offer this for free with a very LIGHT ad presence so you can get paid for the work out into creating this app, fine. If you want to offer the option to pay like 1 or 2 dollars to get rid of the ads, fine. Even if you roll out new amazing content, I mean serious content that you can't find elsewhere, not fonts, themes, backgrounds, photo insertion or that simple bs. But telling me to pay over $5 monthly when I can buy a $1 notebook? No, that is money grubbing."

I am currently a graduate student in psychology, and as such, I used this app with a discerning eye. The first time I opened the app I was greeted by a rather minimal interface with several options on the bottom of the screen, and a big de-stressMe button in the center. The options along the bottom allow you to input information including your strengths, ways to give thanks, and self-care ideas. The information that you input is used when you activate the de-stressing tool. One of the primary components of CBT is cognitive restructuring which entails challenging negative and automatic thoughts. The app cleverly integrates the information that you input into the bottom menus in order to assist you in challenging negatively oriented thoughts that you may experience during times of stress. Additionally, the app may suggest a technique that I am familiar with from my training, diaphragmatic breathing. The app does a good job of teaching and applying the basic tenants of both strategies. Overall, the app was helpful in reducing my stress and is based on sound psychological principles. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to reduce stress in their life.",
            "Lovely, well designed and effective app. A must for those prone to stress and anxiety. Particularly love the images of progressing up a mountain in de-stress mode.",
            "This app is really helping me! It seems simple but is highly effective the more a person practices with it. I'm glad this app is available and is free!"

            "The UI is beautiful, however most of the affirmations are unusable. They are just written the wrong way, in the negative form, with words like \"struggle\", \"worry\", \"difficulties\". Words carry energy, and the right way to write positive affirmations is in the positive form with positive words, not in negating the negative. Example. Instead of \"I won't worry\" effective positive affirmations should use \"I will relax\". I down voted so many of the negative affirmations but they're just too many.",
            "It's a good app. I just wish the other themes worked. I try to view the free add for a new theme, but it never works. Other than that, it's chill app.",
            "The themes are a scam. Why only 1 default? Then you have to watch an ad every single time you want to switch? Ridiculous",
            "I really can't describe it. When I came to the app store looking for a daily affirmation app, I was skeptical, I was in such a dark place, but I got this app anyway feeling desperate to find something to help me. I had to force myself to repeat each affirmation through out the day at first because I was so depressed and self hating. Now, the notification pops up, I read it and I already believe, I am loving myself more and more daily and I honestly can't believe I got that out of a simple app💜",
            "This app is cute & helpful but riddled with ads and that defeats the whole purpose of the app. Who needs all those interruptions when you're trying to enter a zen-like mode? You might as well pay for the dag-on app if you truly want what you came here for. I'll see how I feel about it in a few days. I feel disappointed & played."

Get started by setting your password so that it's completely private. \r\nYou can personalise it if you wish, by choosing the background colour theme and deciding on whether you would like some company using a variety of friendly characters. \r\n\r\nThe app then provides you with four categories of tasks to help you surf the urge. ‘Distract' helps in learning self-control; ‘Comfort' helps you care rather than harm; 'Express yourself' gets those feelings out in a different way and ‘Release' provides safe alternatives to self-injury. \r\n\r\nThere is also a ‘Breathe' category to help calm and get back in control. \r\n\r\nYou can do the activities for either blocks of five minutes or fifteen minutes with a countdown for each minute.

And it's very creative, when I downloaded this app there was a passcode and if you don't remember it, you may reset it by awnsering a simple question.. I do not remember what I put so I had to uninstall and reinstall but that is my fault 5/5 stars",
            "They responded to my comment VERY fast and made it so that I could use the app again! I love this app because it helps me relieve my stress and keeps me safe. I would recommend this app to anyone who struggles with the urge to self-harm because it works wonders for me. If you struggle with the urge to self-harm, PLEASE consider this app!",
            "The app has an amazing selection of helpful activities, however for some reason it struggles to load up initially, as well as loading up things like the log. I've restarted my phone, force closed the app and reopened it, my next option is reinstalling it but if that doesn't work then I'm forced to try other apps, which may not give me nearly as many options for calming myself down so I don't self harm.",
            "Hiya! I just wanna drop by and thank you for making all these mental health apps. I rarely ever see good mental health apps like this and I'm just so thankful that you guys are doing it. Self harm is a very serious struggle and I'm glad that there's more apps to help with it. I'm espically glad that you are making it free because lots of people can't pay for it and by making free, you guys are helping so many more people. Thank you for helping out and spreading more awareness!!! <3",
            "It's great but could you maybe make a 'hide' function? That would be awesome because a lot of people judge when they see apps like this on my phone. So could you maybe have an option to disguise it, like say a calculator."

            "Glad I purchased the Premium. Couple of feedbacks and preferences I've noticed since using this for a few weeks now. I wish there was a better way to construct different and multiple playlists. I have multiple playlists for very diff topics. Sometimes I wish I could play all of them while I sleep. Sometimes I wish I can play some. But it's designed to only play 1 playlist, and you can't modify it without changing the name of the affirmation altogether.",
            "I love the concept for the app, however, there are a handful of small usability issues that become really annoying the more you use the app. 1) No filter or search on affirmation record screen 2) No way to select multiple hashtag playlist for playback 3) No integrated way to stream own music while listening to affirmations. Dropping music vol in thinkup and opening other app causes affirmations to not be loud enough. Still like it a lot, though.",
            "*Edit: THIS APP DOESN'T WORK ON MORE THAN ONE DEVICE. There is no \"restore purchase\" option on my second phone when I download the app, because it DOES recognize that I've already got the premium plan. However, none of my recordings are there. I would have to re-record everything to use this on my other phone.This is a fatal flaw. Can you please fix this so the app can be used on multiple devices?",
            "I like that I can record my affirmations in my own voice. There are a lot of affirmations to choose from and I can edit them to make them personal to me. It would help if there were suggestions given on what background music to use to reach your desired goal. You can also change the level of your voice to the background on the paid version but no guidance is given. Also, the Android version is much cheaper than the one for my iPhone which I thought was weird.",
            "Unfortunately, the Android version isn't fully updated with all the features that the Apple version has. I hope you will update it asap. I bought the Premium version on Android and was dissapointed to see features missing: there is no option to control the speed of the loop of affirmations and there is no Stats tab with statistics about your progress. Such a shame!"

            "A good app for very basic, grounded challenges people with simple lives might face. It's very lacking, however, when it comes to greater, more complex, interconnected challenges. At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",

I'd slacked on using it for a while, & let me tell you... I was really feeling a lot better about myself & my life when I was consistently making time for this. I need to really shave my budget rn, & intended to cancel the Premium version, but I just used it again this morning, & it offers SO much. If you actually *use* it, I think $10/mo is actually a steal. ❤",

            "I have laughed and cried, and had major light bulbs go off... I have gone through over a hundred apps to find something that not only makes sense, but is more than affordable... I haven't slept this well in over 2 decades, and I can't remember when I felt this much hope. Thank you so much!",
            "I have a few different categories chosen. When I entered the app today to continue my sessions there was a recommended lesson that wasn't there yesterday or the day before. I'm already listening to 4 different lessons, and the recommended lesson REMOVED a one that I was actually listening to DAILY, causing me to have to search the app for the lesson that was removed. I cant even remove the recommended lesson. If I wanted another lesson, I would search for it myself. I can't save my lessons :/",
            "This is such a great app. Totally worth the membership! The experts are very relatable, self love, self care, self evaluations - you name it, it s there. All for YOU, about YOU! Thank you SS! Literally a life changer!"

Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced.

Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",

It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking. Meditations are ok.",

Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them.

But don't delete the current time limit profile, just add a new one (sorry for my bad English)",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

My only downside is that this is the second time I've had to download the app because it stopped working the first time, out of nowhere. But I still love it, and it helps so much(:",

It shows you flashes of images to remind you to do things like \"exercise\", \"save money\", \"put your phone down\", etc. I've been using it and primes truly work. I've been exercising more, saving money, and probably 5x more productive by not wasting time on my phone.",

He told me if you want to focus on something start training your subconscious mind and it will take you to your goal very efficiently & I started using this app since. I have been using this app for 3 weeks and trust me initial goals are already 60 % (roughly) achieved. Can't be more happy. Thank you so much ,  looking forward to more addition to primes and updates down the line. Please keep doing good.",

            "Pretty addicting in a positive way. Pretty beneficial for encouraging me to do my assignments in an addicting way. 😄 There are 2 things i want the game to add though: leave the screen on when i use the focus timer, just like the other Foretst does. I don't like constantly unlocking my phone just to check how much time i have left in a focus session ; add a chat function for the group members(maybe, but not really necessary)",
            "It's a really good app, very motivating, cute graphics. However, the only thing I dislike is the (seemingly unnecessary) distinction between 'focus time' and 'pomodoro time'. The latter doesn't show up on the weekly graph and doesn't count towards the group farming either. I find it very frustrating and, again, unnecessary. I hope you can fix this.",
            "To think the app is supposed to help you stay away from your phone it surely tries really hard to make you spend time in the app. You can plant your plants quite comfortably even without doing the focus sessions. The \"21 days to form a habit\" streak is not really based on if you come and focus but if you log in, watch an add and pick up your daily reward. The design is cute, the idea is nice, but it really is a lot more of a game and less of a focus tool.",
            "Great app! Has adorable animations and includes pomodoro! The problem with this is the fact at time when I'm doing a session it bugs out and say I failed so much to the point where I have to watch a video every session. I understand ad revenue but if it's done unintentionally and disruptive to the point of where I cant do a session without saying I failed every time then that's a problem.",
            "It's fun, but I find it weird that an app that's made for staying off the phone uses the same tactics other apps use to keep people hooked (ie waiting times). I would give 5 stars but I can't figure out how to sync other apps. I had to whitelist this on Forest, so I haveto start my timer on Forest then go to this app and start the timer"

            "Love this app. I could be better at using it every day. But, even just using when I feel it's needed always helps calm my mind. If you are into meditation and bettering your mind and calming your body, it helps me do that. I like the Cory guy the best, he does a 31 day starting course. Helps with the foundations a bit. He just seems like a really happy and genuine person. Actually all the instructors do. Only downfall would be, they let you listen to one or two free sets of some courses then you need to pay to unlock the rest. Which I understand the point is to make money. There are plenty of free course. I have used over 6000 minutes of free courses.highly recommend.",
            "I really like the meditations, but what really annoys me is that sometimes some meditations appear in my 'continue listening' section when I haven't even played them and there's no way to clear them from that section. I would really appreciate it if you fixed this issue. Thank you. Edit: it's the second time the app has deleted 'my playlist' (my saved meditations). It's so annoying. Please consider fixing these issues.",
            "I've only just started yesterday. But I've used meditations occasionally in the past. The variety of options for what you're looking for is amazing, and the tutorial like Playlist is fantastic for learning the habits you need for all your meditations. I already feel 10x more relaxed and focused. I tried a sleep meditation last night that made me able to fall asleep in 5-10 minutes after instead of the usual 30+ minutes it usually takes me to fall asleep.",
            "I have tried several meditation apps and I like this one the best thanks to the variety of \"teachers\" who all have different areas of expertise. On the downside, I have always been happy to pay for apps when they are worth the money but I think the price for the yearly subscription is too high compared to other similar apps.",
            "the main page takes forever to load (if it loads at all) and the app keeps crashin almost all the time, and then gets stuck in a cycle where I can't re open it bc it crashes again sessions keep crashing/going back to main page in the middle of listening to a meditation, or don't even load from the beginning. Instead of working on bugs they just add more. Wouldn't recommend. Updated 2020, still no changes"

I like how you make it easy to being imagined. ☆ Inside this app, there's so much life lessons they've (OC's) taught me that my parents or my teacher don't. Thank you for making such a beautiful art. ♡ I still.. collect some money to buy the premium one (haha). I hope it could be great seeing your premium art displayed on my android screen, soon. Stay safe and sound! ✿",
            "I found it boring to be honest. I can see some people may like it. It's a choose your own adventure story. It's written well but often offers choices with only the Illusion of choice. All answers seem to lead to the same thing. In the story some questions the characters ask you it really feels like it's gathering information about you to sell off to advertisers. It asks what your hobbies are etc. I am unsure if this is somehow related to the story later on or not I didn't get very far into it.",
            "Chapter 5 locked despite current description here stating all chapters are unlocked. \"Skip Chapter 4 to Unlock Chapter 5\" does nothing except say to upgrade to pro version for access. Rather infuriating after all the reading to that point. If I had known, I wouldn't have bothered downloading and reading the whole thing to get nowhere.",

            "Does it what it says on the tin. Blocks aps. Parts of the new version is slightly more fiddly than the old mind you (as in it is harder to set up a second schedule). Other than that I find it very helpful. I like the new 'social media' block feature though. I also like the fact that (so far) ads are very small and are only texts rather than images(distractions) Thank you guys and I understand the need for a paid version(I mean someone had to get paid for the hard work) may just upgrade too!!!!",
            "Works perfect until you can delete a profile of an application or site you blocked so you can open blocked application again. That means its not necessary to block an application as you can go back whenever you want. What's the prupose of the developers then? If there is a fix, please tell us. Edit: Thank you so much, appreciate it. You guys deserve an award. Strict Mode enabled and works perfect. Thank you again.",
            "Truly a life saver. I tend to get sucked in to my phone and lose track of time. I love that it doesn't just count minutes consecutively, but cumulatively - so for me, when I've been on Facebook for a cumulative 15 minutes (especially with all my compulsive checking even though it's only a short thing each time) then I have a 55 minute block on it. This app is extremely customizable, so you can make it fit your needs. This is the only app that I've ever felt the need to publicly recommend. 10/5!",
            "Great app, immediately purchased the premium version. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement. A couple of heads-up for the developing team: - I believe the implementation of passwords longer than 6 digits/letters and with special characters (e.g. $!& etc.) would be fairly simple, but at the same time very useful to plenty of users, including me. - On Android 11, ticking the 'lock phone settings' option doesn't actually lock them. To obtain the desired results, it is necessary to manually lock the app 'settings'. Can this be fixed? Thanks a lot and keep up with the good work!",
            "The app itself is great - only one suggestion. Is there an option to clean up all the phone usage data? I didn't find it. If there is not such an option, please consider to add it. It is scary to see all my web footprints logged. I know you don't collect it, but the very existence of such data can be a security threat. I use this app just to lock myself from alluring apps, those usage data is of no use to me and the only reason I may avoid using apps like Stay Focus is security concerns. Thanks"

            "This is very informing and a very nice platform to learn a Lot. Or just to stay brain active. Each read is not too long or short and I love the quizzes. Very nice app. First and only one I stuck to reading from in fact.",
            "New user. The page layout is nice and intuitive. However, the articles so far are disappointing. They are lightweight with little substantial or new information.",
            "Good app. Content is easy enough to read and digest. Could do with a regular change of content, as I often scroll and see the same posts for weeks. Also, by way of UI, there is a huge ad banner that covers a big block of content, which I feel cheapens the overall interface. More discreet ads would make for a more user driven design, while seeing to your revenue.",
            "So during the time that I've actually had this app I've not utilize it as much as I would like but the information and knowledge gained each time I do access the application meets or exceeds expectations. There really is a plethora of information to be gained here and it's easily accessible, navigation is easy & smooth no problems with this app but am rather interested in the premium version. it's actually really great for those few minutes you have to spare to read something informative."

            "Terrible! I bought this last year and it worked fine but the subscription ran out. I paid the renewal fee but it won't register. I cannot log in because I am rerouted to the subscribe page. I was able to call last week, after 4 tries I found a number that let me talk to a live agent. They said it was a known issue but have still not corrected issue or refunded me. Now when I call I only get a bot who won't let me talk to a live agent. Google won't help. DO NOT USE THIS APP! Wasted $$$ REALLY KYLE???? Do you think I haven't already done this? Please do a little research before you send fake help. I am escalating this to the corporate level.",
            "I have been waiting over a year for a response to my initial query. The ONLY way to use QBSE on my phone is to install it, make whatever transaction, then uninstall it. It only works one time per installation. Auto track is toggled on but my mileage is not tracked. It is not calculating my taxes properly. I can only use web version. The only part that works perfectly, every time, without fail, is billing. When Intuit charges me for using QBSE, the transaction is flawless and error-free.",
            "So Many issues. It's the least user friendly software and I spend most of my time trying to fix issues caused by the system itself. Most recently I want to login with my password and not fingerprint as it is unreliable. To remove my finger print I need to use my fingerprint. If that was possible I wouldn't want to remove it would I. It won't let me prove my identity with a password just locks after not recognising my finger prints. Another day another issue with QuickBooks.",
            "After the last update, it will no longer work. Everytime I try to use the app. It glitches out . Getting ahold of customer service is very difficult. The automated prompt will kick you off and make you go to the website , To ask for answers and the automated system their cant help either.",
            "Lots of issues, no help I keep categorising items marked \"uncategorised\". Then when I go back later the same items are marked \"uncategorised\". I have done everything the help service has asked, clear cache, search history etc. Same problem. Then because they didn't know what to do they just stopped answering. I will be looking to get a full return for the entire year as its now completely useless"

Also, organizing them into sections is a good feature as well. That way i feel i can see all my new years resolution and the steps that i must take to achieve them and drag and drop this step to do today and that step to do tomorrow.",

Pay for this app with this errors is a bad idea. I do no feel secure with app I lose taks and time. I hope the app get better. And the plan my day would be good if add the tasks in someday",
            "This still works pretty well, but I'm not a fan of the updated widget not listing tasks chronologically. Edit: Nevermind, the sort order can be changed through the app. Thanks to the dev who pointed this out to me. You and your app have been helpful :)",

            "I have started to use the application in 2009. Then I liked it. In addition to this, I've decided to purchase for premium, created another account and shared my notebooks with my premium account. Then I couldn't see my shared notebooks on the web and mobile. I've been struggling with technical support for 2 weeks. They have promised for full technical support, I'm writing but they haven't returned for 5 days. Unfortunately, I'm switching back to Microsoft Onenote.",
            "After the major update to the app, the note texts are not readable anymore. Looks like Evernote messed up the text color setting in Android. My noted works fine in iPad and on PC. I always leave the text color as default and never changed it. However, in Android, text is in dark grey in Dark Mode, and light grey in Light mode. So the text color is always very close to the background color no matter which mode I choose. And this MAJOR issue has been there for at least a week!",
            "Ruined after the recent upgrade roll out: 1) Notes take ages to load up. 2) All the fonts which used to be available have now disappeared and all my notes are suddently in Sans Serif. At least it wasn't Comic Sans. 3) None of the desktop keyboard shortcuts I used to use which made this app efficient to use have disappeared. 4) It needs to be online to work - unnecessary and annoying Probably other things have gone wrong - it's only been a few hours since the upgrade. It wasn't broken - why try to fix it?? I've been a Premium subscriber for years - now considering cancelling & switching.",
            "I used to love this app and I use it a lot for work and personal info organisation. The latest update is an utter disaster for me. It requires a constant internet connection, which I - and millions of other people on this planet - don't have. I used to be able to work on notes whether I was online or offline - a helpful little red exclamation symbol would appear on the sync item when the app couldn't sync because the internet was down, so I would be careful not to change to working on the same note on a different device. Now the app insists on me reloading the note when the internet is down and wipes out my latest edits. This is useless! I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online. If this continues to be a problem I will, finally, have to relinquish my subscription and migrate to a different tool. (NB the Windows 10 app update doesn't even appear to have the option to change the sync setting at all - in fact the settings menu seems to have disappeared completely!!!)",
            "After the recent update, I've lost all my notes from the past 1 week simply because they had not automatically synced. The update was automatic btw. Pathetic experience, and quite stressful too. I was thinking of upgrading to premium but will definitely not do it now, after realizing my content can be deleted anytime without a fair warning."

Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",

Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Also, where are the time features? Please make them available, they would be very useful.",
            "Love your app but helpless. U are looking for selective set of people with good income but the fact is all need this. Incase you compromise by low fees or 1 time charge, you will get many many many more . I hope you know what have you created and how many need it and how many are aware u exsist and how many have reached and how many subscribe and how many leave and I also hope you know, how big India is atleast.

            "Looks good. It will be great if the image space under \"My Goals\" can be bigger or has a crop function so that if we use our own image it can reflect the whole image instead of partially. This way it can double as a vision board. Under Morning/Evening Routine reflections, the space for input is too small. When my sentence is longer than the space given, I am unable to read the whole entry."

            "I really like this app. There are a wide variety of available sessions and i enjoy being able to put in my emotions and have a list of tailored sessions. I have two recommendations: the first is to be able to search for sessions by name or topic, and the second is to have the option put in the goal of the session instead of/in addition to your emotions, to help the list of sessions be even more tailored to you. I also wish the voices were a bit more soothing (slower/calmer/quieter/gentler)",
            "I love using the meditation timer on this app. It has guided meditation as well as timed with different sounds, like the forest, rain and desert, etc. You can also choose the length of time of mediation and if you would other sounds. Some features unlock with more use or if you buy the subscription. This is a great app! Update: I still use this app everyday! It is amazing!",
            "Works wonders for my anxiety! The body scan practice actually stopped me from having a panic attack last year. I have a difficult time with sounds, but I love Jamie's calming voice. Thank you for creating such a wonderful outlet that allows me to calm down and breathe when I forget to. I highly recommend this app to my mental health group as well!♡",
            "Deceptively simple app, it seems like theres almost nothing to it at first. But what it does have, actually works. The breathing timer is my go to, especially during these stressful times. Every now and then I'll go with one of the guided meditations too, they're pretty cool. There's an explanation in the settings about how meditation actually helps that doesnt sound like total spiritual nonsense, so that was pretty cool. My only complain is that the art style.",
            "Love this app. I'm a mental health provider and I work with young people. This is a great way to introduce mindfulness. I'm also so excited that you added a Progress Muscle Relaxation exercise (Squeeze and Let Go)! I've looked high and low for a good one, never found one until this!"

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

            "First of all, it's completely free to use, and there are no ads. Already standing out from the crowd. The app itself is just really good. Only used it for a couple days but seems really good so far. Love the kind of \"social media stories\" layout think it works well apart from it goes back instead of forward quite often when tapping near the middle. Thank you!",
            "Impressive, clarifying and insightful. This app is beautifully designed (not just visually, but also from a user design perspective). It's easy, small little tasks that are done in 2/3 minutes and give you a bit more insight or help you when your head is racing because of... F.e. stress. Give it a try. It's quite unbelievable it's free. I would love to pay a one time sum of money / small donation to use it!",
            "Its been excellent so far. Not invasive, but still gives me incentive to go back to it. I like the way things are paced, and i've surprisingly really enjoyed the journaling feature (something I was pretty sure I was going to use exactly zero times unless forced). All in all just a calm space that i can go to once or twice a day to reflect and try to better myself a bit. Easily recommended.",
            "This app was so wonderful! Compared to other apps which have limited things for free, this app has everything you need for FREE!! It has so many rescue sessions that help me so much! Every 3-4 days there are check-ins, and I definitely don't regret installing this app!! Sometimes the page takes a long time to load. But overall I LOVE this app and definitely reccomend it!!",
            "Just wow... I've used apps making similar claims, usually disappointed in what I experience; ads constantly or gimmicky content locked behind Premium version. Not so with Intellect! It's free and ad free but more than that, it actually does what it claims. This app has and continues to help me immensely and I am going to say the craziest thing but, I'd like to pay for it! It's rare to find such value and I highly recommend Intellect to everyone. We all have things to improve. Thank you so much!"

            "I 100% recommend this planner. It is so helpful in my everyday life instead of piling everything into my Memo's where it doesn't have daily separations. If you're thinking of getting a planner app, this one is great, but I do have a recommendation for the creator(s) to add. [Unless it's in premium, I don't have it.] I think we should have an \"edit\" option on things, incase we misspell something like that!",
            "Very good, thanks 🤗😁👍, appreciate the stability of the App and how it runs so smooth! This App has such intuitiveness and keeps me on-the-move with organizing my tasks. The card-type interface is really cool 👍, I especially like the dark theme. I bought it 🧡💛❤️... Love how the numbers above the date number on the calendar page resemble a traffic light for task completion...! red-yellow-green, clever!",
            "Re-reviewing because my last one was negative, but that was my own fault! 🤦‍♀️ I couldn't figure out how to rearrange tasks and thought it wasn't an option, but the developer very kindly got back to me and let me know how it was done. So with that in mind, five stars! I can't think of a thing that would make this app better. (Premium is also totally worth it, by the way!)",
            "I just started using this app about two hours ago and I am overwhelmingly thrilled. It is easy to use, very user friendly, it offers all the functions we need for daily self- organisation in a simple way. It is excellent. This app makes the calender, a notepad and many more Android apps useless😉. Thanks",
            "I have ADD, therefore, staying on task is a problem for me. With this app, not only can I create a list of things that need to be done, but I can create sub-lists which is almost always a necesssity for me. Definitely a 5 star rating!"

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

            "My first day with the app was awesome! I'm taking advantage of the frequency (time& tone) within the app to maintain my daily practice. I haven't paid yet, but I've been practicing a few years; and the free version will do the trick for now. The voice and singing bowl effect is calming. I have a past with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I would recommend \"7mind\" to any of my friends or family. To anyone reading this: All is well and you're on the right path! Thank you, 7mind.",
            "In general the courses are not bad. What I don't like: -No decent possibility to plan in advance and confusing categories. Beside the courses there's no way to plan several days in advance=>new decision necessary every time -No proper synchronizing when using the same account on both of my phones (phone 1 (2): 106 (82) meditations, 1055 (778) min, 3 (1) day streak. It seems so synchronise it partly, as on both phones the numbers change If my health insurance wouldn't pay, I'd never pay so much.",
            "Everything superb. 5 stars if one can fast forward in a module. Atm I need to start from the beginning to get grasp of some Information, which would be better if I could directly jump to that point.",
            "very calm voice, different tyles of meditations, helps a lot so far",
            "The best meditation app i know and I'm so grateful for this app. The meditations are so awesome!!! 7 mind+ is sometimes also payed for by health insurance. Also thank you for making the app more stable and use less storage."

            "Its unfortunate that they dont advertise the Student discount. $9.99/year is astoundingly generous of them. Thanks! But I dont think anyone knows about this deal. I only learned about this when I accidentally stumbled across a YouTube comment from a year ago. Awesome app, great stuff for sleep. It do be crashing though. Just recently, so idk if it's just me or everyone else got the same problem?",
            "This app was brilliant when I first started using it every day - especially during lockdown - but now that Headspace Plus is a thing, it's way too expensive to access to the soundscapes & meditations that I was using before. The selection available now, without Headspace Plus, is shockingly little especially considering I am already paying for the app! I liked a nice mix of things to help me sleep but now I can only listen to the same three things on rotation which isn't great. Not happy at all.",
            "My 5-year old and I saw a commercial for this app which featured a cute animated video of a \"robot\" slowly shutting down its systems in advance of falling asleep. I thought this would be a great app for my kid to watch while doing bedtime, so I signed up for a (pretty pricey) subscription. Immediately was disappointed by the fact that no such cutesy videos are ACTUALLY part of the app (most of it appears to consist of streaming audio). Feels a bit like false advertising...",
            "I only use this app for the Sleepcasts, they're very peaceful to listen to and I usually fall asleep after the first 15 minutes or so. A few months ago they offered 3 to listen to for free, but now they only offer 1, and all of the others are behind a pretty high pay wall - its incredibly frustrating, especially during this time and all the stressful things everyone is going through in their lives",
            "Just updated the app for the first time in around a year. The new organization of meditation options is awful. Examples: you have a lot of activity-specific meditations, but the only way to access them is to remember what they're called and search. Also, i don't want to have to scroll forever, past lots of meditations that I'll never be choosing (e.g., kids), just to see what's available. Alphabetical organization of every option is tedious and difficult to get through."

            "It's really nice application i have ever used. I hardly ever give feedback. This is my first time giving because it is worth. I was having a problem to write new kind of contents and to make presentation, but i have no idea what to do. Cause of this app, i found solutions. Thank God.",
            "It is an amazing app but the only reason I am giving it a 4 star review I because it only has portrait mode. I tend to use my tab for reading and I use it on landscape mode almost all the time but for this app I have to change the view, Please fix this.🙏",
            "An incredible app that will not only develop you emotionally, but also how you perceive the world as a whole.It's extraordinary how after just some days of following to the latter it's content you find your behaviour having drastically deviated from the old bad habits you used to engage in and you start earning respect from those around",
            "This is an amazing app. Whenever a notification popped up, the first thing I would do is read the article. It not only brought about a sense of consciousness related to various matters but also helped me appreciate myself and the world around me. Apart from personality development, it had also helped me to start reading and being consistent. But the English is very poor, possibly because these are articles sent by people and posted without assessing it further",
            "Good ideas, very poor English. It was painful to read the daily short self improvement articles, not because of their messages, but because they used such poor English with so many errors. They read like they were crowd sourced to non-native speakers. This got in the way of what might have been an enjoyable daily experience and I uninstalled the app. I enjoyed most of the inspirational quotes with illustrations in background."

It has helped me so much with my panic attacks and anxiety reducing the impacts to managing my Diabetes. I have highly recommended this app to my doctor, friends and my psychologist to help other people in my local community of regional Sydney Australia. A huge thank you to the Dare team :)",

            "Amazing App to help you conquer anxiety! Barry has a soothing voice and his audios are outstanding! I am so happy that I stumbled on this app. The content is extensive and super helpful. The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",

Just wish there were more credit card offers other than Capitol One because they made a mistake on my credit score and won't accept me. Other than that it's great and I reccomend anyone needing to improve their credit to try Self. As long as u make your payments on time it really works.!",
            "Love this App. It is helping me rebuild my credit and has raised my score by 33 points since my last payment and a total of 94 points since I started my Self Acct!!! I can't wait to see my score once I get my loan paid off. I will do another Self loan to keep building my credit once this loan is complete. Thanks Self!!! You are making a BIG difference in my credit and I would definitely recommend you to anyone in need of repairing or building their credit!!!",
            "The savings account that helps you build credit is good. The card they offer you is a little bit of a scam. They do not tell you they take a deposit from what you have saved that you are not getting back for an undisclosed amount of time and they take more deposit than the credit limit they give you.",
            "I was unsure of the impact this would have on my credit score. I signed up last month and have made my first payment about a week ago, and my score increased 68 points today! I'm very happy I read the reviews of others that have been having a positive experience using Self! Thank you for this great service, I'll certainly continue using it to help get me back to where I was a couple years ago!",
            "Score went up 30 points in my first month. I set up auto pay for the last day of the month since they report to the credit bureaus around the 1st. Make sure you send the first payment in before the end of your first month, otherwise you'll have to wait another month before it gets reported to the credit bureaus."

I've changed my password, thinking I had it wrong, but I still get the error \"Unable to Login\", not the \"Password/login info is incorrect\". If I want to make a new account I would have to make another email address, since this is tied to my email. It's really frustrating and I can only think that this is some sort of bug.",

Why would they add bills to the app, but not let you access it through the actual app? I've tried using budgeting to look after bills instead, but it's not intuitive enough for that purpose. ADD A BILLS TAB TO YOUR APP PLEASE...",
            "Biggest flaws: When an account is replaced with a new card the account shows as if it's a separate account and for some reason certain transactions are showing on that account while most transactions were able to transfer to the new account. In addition, it shows that the credit limit for the new account is \"N/A\" or \"$0\". There's an issue also where I accidentally input inactive on one of the replacement card and can't change it back to active. No way to migrate the accounts.",
            "I've been using this for a few months, but when I woke up today I had several transactions duplicated. I don't know how to fix this, and no Mint troubleshooting pages tell me how This is my second review, I think the first one was deleted which is unfortunate. A single transaction in my bank account turns into the seven of the exact samein mint, completely skewing my budget. I read reviews before I downloaded, and I heard of other people having issues. I guess I thought I was lucky. Help?",

The ads are very short but very distracting and irritating. I suspect they are the main purpose of the app for the developer. I also suspect that most positive reviews are fake. The content isn't bad but tbh it's nothing new and not particularly well written. However, if you're new to SMART goals and not bothered by the ads it might be of some value.",

I've been on a journey of self discovery and self love and the messages at different intervals are so perfect to remind me of my goals. I often find myself sharing these with friends. I switched phones and I had to redownload. Love this app ❤",

One thing I would love to see in the future is the ability to add a few of my own affirmations in the mix along with the ones that you have chosen. Like, give me a blank (no text, just the pics/etc) template for each category and let me type in the words I would like to see in that category. That would be an amazing addition!",

I highly recommend this app to anyone that needs encouragement or motivational words in there life. The fact that you can personalize it to have you name in the message you recieve makes this app even better bc its actually like your own personal message from your life encouraging you every step of the way. Thank you so much for help me im my journey of my recovery and bettering my life!. Nikki Morris💜💛",

            "I haven't used this app for a long time but it's great so far! I really love it. But i have a problem, the schedule. I set a schedule (let's say \"study\") to try it out and set the time as \"everyday\". But after i deleted it, the other days have not been deleted. It keeps saying \"go to the first day for multi-day schedules to make changes\" even tho i have deleted it for that day!! Please fix this. But apart from that, this app is amazing!! Definitely recommend downloading it! <3",
            "I'm wondering whether it would be possible to add an habit tracker to the app. Then eveyday you can indicate the habits you did with a yes or no option. At the end of the month it would be interesting to see how much you sticked to it....I think this would be a feature that would actually give something more compared to a physical planner where you have to do it by yourself...",
            "It has super great concept. But bad ui and ux. Hard to understand and messy, many unnecesary click. I found that on web it much cleaner and easy. Suggestion, for schedulle i think you can sync with calendar, or google calendar. That might help a lot.",
            "Best planner app . I love it . There are daily qoutes,bouce note , daily article , monthly goals ,bucklists, to do things , reflect your day , rate your day , workout section etc.. make .ore app s plz I love this app 💕💕💕💕💕"

            "I like this app because it keeps you focused and on track by locking your apps (and websites) during the day. I have the schedule on when I am in school. I also like it because there is two settings. Work mode, which you can add more apps that you don't need while you are just doing work, but you woudl need during the day like texting. Overall a really good app!",
            "Excellent for productivity. I can block YouTube, social media, etc. Whether they be the apps or the websites versions. The password feature is very effective so long as I make the password really long and inconvenient to input. I prefer this app to my last website blocker, BlockX, because BX was too puritan. They were overly concerned with blocking sexual content, to the extent that videos about \"Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom\" were considered off-limits and forced me to turn off the app.",
            "Horribly suspicious privacy policy. The app collects your browsing history information \"in order to provide you insights about your usage.\" No, the app doesn't need to \"give me insights.\" It needs to block spam & scams -- not to BE one. This app is a scam, stealing the information it's supposed to protect for you. Don't install it.",
            "I have previously given a 2-star. I want to revisit and change it to 5-star, so that it can average out to 4-star. What I like: user friendliness, visuals, prompt customer support. What can improve: In the app description they should list down currently supported web browsers and software versions. I list down below for your convenience Android: Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Opera Mini and Brave. iOS: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Aloha, Puffin, edge and Opera Touch. Extension: Chrome and Firefox",
            "This app isn't a ad, pop up or something like that blocker, but it can block stuff that distracts you! You see, I've known stuff that kids don't need to know(basically 18+ stuff), and now I'm getting random 18+ pop ups from a website I never known about! I've tried tons of \"Ad blocker\" apps, but none of them work! Finally, I got this and now, I've blocked 18+ stuff, and it's literally my savior! I stopped getting the random pop ups. Thanks!"

        "description": "Wish to build confidence and have higher self esteem? Want to learn how to become more successful and enjoy the power of inner-dialogue?\r\n\r\nIMPROVING CONFIDENCE IS SIMPLE\r\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your self esteem and wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, and maladaptive behaviours. \r\n\r\nHOW DO I BUILD MY CONFIDENCE\r\nThe foundations of healthy confidence and self esteem are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \"everything in my life needs to be prefect\", I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. With daily affirmations, we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk. We can change our beliefs and get rid of thinking patterns that negatively affect our confidence and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nHOW GG SELF-ESTEEM WORKS\r\nThe app is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thoughts\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\r\n3. Increase your daily access to affirmations and positive thoughts\r\n4. Increase the automaticity of helpful thinking\r\n5. Provide daily affirmations for confidence and self-esteem boost\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nKNOW YOUR THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your confidence, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nBEGIN YOUR JOURNEY\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 500 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Users are required to complete a random set of 'thoughts' to complete the level.\r\nTo further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, each level the player completes is followed by a memory game in which one has to identify a supportive statements that appeared in the previous level.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty, fear of abandonment, and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I COMPLETED ALL THE LEVELS\r\nThe key to using the app is learning new topics, but even more importantly - training daily.

I was highly disappointed to find out that the original app is no longer on my phone and has instead been replaced by an app that charges a monthly subscription. Fair enough if the creators want to follow this model but I do find it very unfair that the early adopters who paid full price for the original app no longer have access to it.",
            "Updated review: The previous version was very good and I was finding it very useful. The new update locked the app for me again despite having purchased a full unlock and all my progress was lost. But I got help from a developer to unlock the app again and I will try the new one now from the beginning and see how it works for me.",
            "I paid for the full version (which guaranteed lifetime access) before they updated it. Now they're saying I have to pay monthly? This feels like a scam and could potentially damage people who they've once helped. This is dangerous",
            "I like this app, but it only let's you do three exercises a day, and no other way to practice during the day without having to start all over and then you find again at some point, you have to stop at three exercises. They need to have better instructions. There should be a clearly explained way to practice any time you want, as well as do the 3 main exercises a day.",
            "A nice app, but I didn't get a feeling or indication from the app that it was going to be helpful and it's already asking for money. I hope you will let people see more of the app to understand what is happening with the questions we're answering and how everything works, and if it works. Still skeptical, just haven't seen enough yet. Thanks for letting me try it out!"

            "The app is cute but doesn't work properly. It only worked for a month. Then the app's reaction time slowed down significantly. When I wanted to tap on the habit it took about 10 seconds to do something and it was getting worse the longer I had this app. Today I am clicking and waiting and nothing's happening. I paid for a year and regret it. I only used it for 3 months. The last month the app was basically unusable. Stay away from this app. I am uninstaling it. No calendar/overview.",
            "Easy to use and a very clean design. Although is not a bad thing, at first when I opened the app it gave me the option to set up habits according to different needs. Like if I needed inspiration or other activities but when I try to find those options again they don't appear anymore. I would like it if they are available again so I have a sort of 'guide' to now which habits I'd like to take up. But the fact that it gives me freedom to add the my own is good too.",
            "I've tried so many habit apps, motivation apps, etc, etc. And none of them worked for me. But I love Avocation! It's a super clean format, user friendly, and adorable art. My only request is more icons to choose from. Other than that I'm thrilled I finally found an app that works!",
            "Very fun concepts and excellent graphic design! Everything is laid out in a way that makes it easy to understand. Nothing bad happens if you skip a day and only needing to do at least one habit a day to grow the plant really helps combat my perfectionism. A widget and more detailed stats are apparently on the way, and I look forward to it! Pricing is reasonable & everything essential is free. The one suggestion I have is being able to repeat the tutorial where it gives you ideas for new habits.",
            "Great app! Has really helped keep myself accountable for the habits I'm trying to maintain. Has a really beautiful and easy to use UI. And the plant feature is really lovely too. I just wish I could add more habits in the free version, but of course understand that the developers need to make money with the paid version. And that also means that there aren't disruptive ads!"

            "Recently, I went through an experience that really shook me. My pastor suggested thanking God daily in a deliberate, rather than my usual haphazard way, as a means of connecting with God less randomly. I found 'Presently' shortly after, and I make daily entries, reviewing them monthly. I have lots to be thankful for, and I am closer to God than before!",
            "I really enjoy this app. I've been using it for a while now and it's simple, easy to use, and streamlined. It has customisation options which are great if you prefer apps with a \"dark-mode\", its otherwise uncluttered design and interface provide a calming and reassuring feel. I like the daily reminders and that it has milestones for how many days you've tracked. It's a nice way to reflect on my day and focus on the positives. Presently rocks, so please never change! You're already perfect!",
            "Simple, focused & without advertising distraction. Colorful selection of background themes to choose from. Pithy quotes on gratitude, daily reminders & timely encouragements to develop the habit of gratitude. Pleasure to read & re-read past entries. Growing to be grateful for things past, thankful for the present and hopeful of the future - come what may, surely I can still find something to be thankful for. Simple app to build a lifelong, daily habit of gratitude. Highly recommended.",
            "I've been using this for about a week and am really enjoying it so far. The best things are that it has a simple but aesthetic design and the fact that there are no ads. And although you can write whatever you want, being asked what you're grateful for is a great start and helps me begin positively which I struggle with but think it's good to do for mental health. I hope these things never change because it makes it so calming and stress free to use compared to other journalling apps!",
            "Simple, easy to use, and convenient gratitude app. I love that it sends nightly reminders and there is nothing complicated about it. I look forward to getting my nightly reminders and I am now feeling so much more intuned to the things big and small I can show gratitude for daily. Love this so much!"

It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Why is this happening? It seems random. Can anyone explain why this is happening. Duplicate photos only appearing on my phone, the computer version is always perfect.",
            "I was more of a pen and paper type, which I still do on occasion but I love the fact I can ad photos and that will autoadjust the location of my entry to match the photo so I can show and speak to the moment. I can also journal on my driving commute which is always where I'm unloading the days thoughts and feel inspired. It's so easy and will always be able to be found.",
            "I tried to export the journal to a new email account; exportation is only supported with a premium account. So I signed up for a 7-day trial with auto-renewal in order to export my journal... but was unable to import the journal into the new email account. Now frustrated, I tried to turn off the auto-renewal so I wouldn't be charged for a functionality that didn't work. No dice. The link provided in the help desk was 404-ed, the link provided in the desktop app didn't work. In short, fraudulent.",

            "At first I loved the app and made entries daily. Then all of sudden a question pops up in my head, \"what if the developers reads these daily enteries\". I never felt right since. I purchased the membership but I dont feel I have 100% privacy."

            "i love this app. the art style is beautiful, and not overly stimulating so it stays a calm environment. i love the unique personalisation features. i struggle a lot with stress and self hatred, and this app genuinely helps me. there's no stressful game i'm trying to beat, no time limits, no adds. it's so refreshing. i don't come rushing in trying to do ten things at once. i can take my time to complete my activities. and i can choose which ones to do. i love the items too. highly recommend.",
            "When I have no one to talk to and I feel close to my lowest, if I have enough left in me, I'll open this app and start going through the activities. I always start off thinking they're stupid and pointless and full of lies. But I keep on doing it and always feel better enough, after a few minutes, to where I can think clearly and rationally again. I may not feel bright and cheery, but I don't want to cause myself harm anymore after some time on this app.",
            "Perfect. I didn't know how much I needed this. Downloaded during quarantine and feel so much better all the time. I highly recommend. I love how the room is messy but after awhile it feels like home. It makes me feel at peace and validated. Best app I've found so far please download. Even if you think you don't need it I promise you that you do need it.",
            "I absolutely love this app. However half of the things that helped me are no longer here. Paper flowers, picture puzzle, the locket, jar, journal, etc are gone. I figured if you check in daily they'd reappear. The moon, altar and the tarot cards did but that was it. I'd love to see them all back. So for that I did a 4 star instead of a 5.

I really love the app, it's incredible and so comforting to know we can indulge in our emotions, we can stay as long as we'd like and feel however we'd like and encourage ourselves with all the activities in it, it's so great for grounding and comfort!

            "Love this app. The premium is worthwhile. One problem though. The strict mode. I find myself disabling the regular mode every couple of days, so strict mode is fantastic. But it blocks the use of settings entirely. Whether you want to make a mobile hotspot, pair a Bluetooth device or just check something, the app block will stop you. Using strict mode even just for more than a day or two can be seriously painful and impractical if you use these things. Please try to find a solution to this!",
            "Just noticed a little glitch. When you set an hourly limit, if you go over it it says 'you have no more time for TODAY' but then it resets the next hour. If they can fix this to say something like 'youve used all your time for this hour' I would change my review to 5 stars Unfortunately this is happening with all features. I have blocked certain apps from 1am to 9am and when I try to open it says you have used all y.our time for TODAY. which is not accurate",
            "Helps me control what apps I want to be using during the productive hours of the day. One thing I would like to know about is how I can set a profile and leave it on indefinitely (so instead of a timer, it just stays on till I go to turn it off). Update: I contacted the support team and they helped me figure it out. Thank you!",
            "I have a real problem with accessing certain sites too often and while I'm at work. I was using this app to great effect until I just started disabling the block when I didn't like it (oops). Well I just found the locking option! Now this is perfect for me. Thanks for helping me be professional at work :)",
            "I've used the app for a couple of weeks and although it helped my productiveness, there are a couple of things I find really puzzling. For example, although it blocks notifications (which is great!), I can still see them in the app itself. If there's one thing that makes me desperate to go on social media again, it's seeing an incomplete message. Giving me some but not all information about what's going on feels immensely distracting. Also, Messenger is impossible to block. Why?"

            "I love it 😍 soooo much. At first i thought that it only had the default challenges, and i was about to look for another app to complement it. But then i realized that you can set your own challenges and tailor them to your exact needs. That is when i jumped for joy. I have needed something like this all my life ❤️ thank you so much and God bless you. Keep up the amazing work . Also after the 21 days are over you can restart the challenge ( with the same daily steps or change them).So flexible ☺",
            "An update. I removed 2 stars from my review for the following reasons: 1. Volume control/mute doesn't exist in settings. The ads are very jarring and come by surprise. 2. I created my own challenge, and none of the days saved. Every scratch was blank so I deleted it. Finally, a habit tracker that I actually like! I like how simple and streamlined the app is. Not hard to use. Easy to adapt the challenge to your individual needs if the suggestion for the day doesn't apply to you.",
            "A real app that you can use in life..I love the topics, the suggestions really work and you can tell it was made with very good intentions. I do not force myself to follow what comes up day by day, but I do return to all the unchecked ones and see what chances come to complete them in the flow of the day. A good balance between being in the flow and directing your life. I love it. Thank you.",
            "I absolutely love this app. I use it every day and it makes me so happy; especially the the tiny motivational and heartfelt quotes that you get as notifications every day, it's so wholesome to hear \"it's okay to be emotional, it's what makes you human, beautiful and powerful\" (for example) after a rough day ^^ i always smile when i receive those notifications and it makes me feel so much better",
            "My favourite thing is the daily little inspirational notification which sometimes comes at the best time to pick me up if my mood is not that great. I like the diversity of the challenges, the structure of them and although it might sound silly, I do like the idea of scratching a card to find out your daily task, it boosts the excitement and puts me in a good headspace to get the task done. Great job to the developers and implementers!! Also, I do really enjoy the colour scheme, very calming"

Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",

        "comments": [
            "Very insightful and useful. Provides interesting information regarding your device usage. From here you can decide if you have a usage problem. Nicely laid out data, with many options. You can easily set limits or alarms to apps that are being used too much.",
            "It's a good app. I was shocked to find I spent 6 hours a day, but now I only spend 2 hours a day excluding online classes. The reason for the three stars is because the alarm doesn't work. I reinstalled the app, check for updates but it doesn't work at all. The alarm for exceeding daily limit doesn't work. When I delete them alarm and create another one, it shows, \"you have exceeded your daily limit today, the alarm will activate tomorrow.\" Please look into this issue as soon as possible.",
            "Best screentime app I have found. It tracks your time per app. You can blacklist apps so it doesn't track them. I blacklisted maps because I want to track when I'm actually looking at my phone. You can set alarms and notifications for usage time. You can even change the notification label such as \"that's enough for today.\" I have cut my social media time in half. It reminds me that I want to do something else with my time, like reading or drawing.",
            "I love it. But there's just one thing I'd like you to add. When the application is blocked because of the limit I sometimes cheat and change the timing so I add extra minutes. It'd be great if I couldn't do that. So when the application is blocked I can't change the timing for that day anymore. Anyway It really makes me realize I spend way too much time on my phone and that I need a break. I've also been noticing lack of concentration and stress so I'm trying to change that with this app.",
            "Started using Space and the pop up notification got on my nerves quickly, found this one and immediately loved it, all the features that you need for this purpose are free but some extras are optional to buy. Best part of that? A points program as a reward system that will unlock those features too! Hey \"Space\", if you really want to \"help\" people, Don't make pivotal options for app usage cost $$$! You guys nailed it for me, very happy. (◠ᴥ◕ʋ)"

Anyway, very good app.",
            "I've tested at least 7 different money manager apps, and this one seems to be the best. The UI is awesome and so is the UX. Everything makes sense once you put some time into it. There is no option to sync with bank accounts/cards. If that is something you want, look elsewhere. The only thing stopping me from buying the premium upgrade is the lack of router-less access from a PC.",
            "Just two things I'm missing: 1. Budgeting in different than the main currency. For example: I'm in a different country and I'm budgeting rent in different currency but still want to keep my main currency. 2. I expected much more from the PC Manager. It looks as being developed in 2005. It doesn't even relate to the actual app. But overall, the app itself is one of the greatest amongst all the others I've used throughout the years. The design and structure of the app are first class!",
            "Two stars less for two draw-back. 1. Please add an option to enable notification to record the expenses daily with particular time set up. I usally forget to record the expense at the end of the day. But another money manager app which I use has this feature. It remember me daily at a particular time which I set up on the app itself. 2. Ads. Which is not irritating, but still it's annoying. Note : If it's solved, I would like to give 5 stars⭐⭐⭐",
            "I have been using this app for about a year to keep tracking my daily expenses. I recommended to my girlfriend and she told that it was easy to get started with. No issue to transfer the data from old phone to new. As I saw from other reviews about the premium version is one time fee, me and my gf are going to support this app. Keep up the good works 👍🏻"

            "Amazing. So helpful! Really this is the best app I have on my phone. Its the best AI therapist I've ever talked to. It actually feels like it listens and responds appropriately. Woebot really helps you through things when you need help. Also, there are no ads and no in-app purchases, it's crazy awesome. I tell all my friends who I think would benefit from having this app, because I've found it very helpful. 10/10 app, thank you so much!!",
            "This app is extremely helpful. A little robot, an anonymous person, to tell my worries to. The gratitude journal is super helpful too, I can look back on what's gone well. The lessons it provides are really helpful too. Sometimes, I open the app with just the intention of checking in my mood for the tracker, and i end up spending half an hour doing a lesson! They're always super helpful and make me feel better. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
            "Came across this through work and during lock down. I have not noticed anything negative about it, performance wise. Overall it's a useful well being tool to help check in with yourself and offers some useful prompts and insights about impactful things on a person's mood. You seem to be able to converse with it when you have a spare few mins. Fairly easy to 'forget' it's A.I . you are conversing with.",
            "The AI for Woebot sometimes misses what I am saying, but overall this app gives daily lessons on helpful thought patterns and tools. While not a replacement for therapy, it provides additional tools my therapist had not included as well as reinforcement of some of the tools I was already taught. I encourage other folks to try Woebot as a supplement to their self care routines and therapy.",
            "I found the app very comforting and helpful during a stressful period. I'm familiar with CBT but it was still useful to be reminded of those skills. And although you know it's not a real person talking to you, knowing that a real person wrote the text originally is comforting, and shows that someone cares."

Something has changed that doesn't allow the older versions to open any backup created with the latest version. BEWARE!",
            "I absolutely adore the app. (Though I use it rarely and i am still not familiar with all the possibilities - and there is quite a lot of them). It is so flexible and it fits my needs perfectly. I adore the way I can adjust absolutely everything to be exactly the way I want it. I use the app with Google synchronization to store recipes and list of books. Synchronization allows me to share the Google sheets with my family and collaborate with them on both libraries.",
            "This is an extremely powerful way to keep records. I have only been using it a short time so there is so much more to learn. I have created a medical records library so far and the ability to actually design my own unique database is just fabulous. I have lots of wishes for new features but I am still such a beginner, you probably have them already. The app is so powerful and versatile, there is a steep learning curve to take full advantage. Keep up the great work!",
            "I have been using Memento for well over 5 years now & the ease which one can create a useable database is unbelievable. Backing up my databases is a breeze, be it online or transferring to SD card. This program is pretty much perfect when it comes to functionality. I can't highly recommend it enough.",
            "I don't often review an app on the day I install it, but this one warrants it. I was looking for a daily log to track supplements, calories, protein, sleep duration and quality, dream recall, and more. Everything I found in the play store is either too specific (i.e., only a dream journal or only a diet log) or too complex and not customizable. Memento is exactly what I needed, and now I'm thinking about what other apps it can replace. Nice work, devs."

Every time I try to do a manual password login I have to reset my password because QuickBooks says I'm denied access. on the few occasions I do get it to sign in easily through my phone the app crashes and has to restart.",
            "24-10-2020 Provided this review The app has a bug currently in version 25.4.1+1 where you cannot search and select invoices to match against bank payments. When you select them it's as if you have not selected any. The totals do not change. Update 28-10-2020 Received response from QuickBooks to uninstall and reinstall the app. I have tried this and there has been no improvement.",
            "Quickbooks will not give an option to permanently turn off the option to allow clients to pay by credit card. You have to turn it off manually everytime. I sometimes forget and my client pays by credit card, and I an charged almost 3% for it. I am a small business with no need to accept credit cards so I loose money every time I forget to turn it off. Update. Now it turns out that on my android phone I can only see activity for each client for 1 year which is a BIG issue.",
            "using qbs desktop since 2002. today i found qbs files in the trash basket. i hit restore and its totally gone now. been researching for 5 hrs to restore it . nothing. i tried online before. didnt like it, but guess its my only option since desktop 2018 will be gone soon. very aggravating. im at the point of creating invoices by hand. only 30 customers .",
            "Used it on a sales call yesterday. Created a customer, emailed him an estimate. (I hope). Today I logged on QBO from my PC and the address was wrong. So was the phone number. Then I tried logging on to the app to run a test case and I got the \"There is a technical issue...\" type error message. There are other usability issues with the QBO software too. Edit: Yoshi has a review below and QB replied with a link. I just tried the link and it sends you to the help pages. Gee, didn't I think of that."

Apart from BK Shiwani and few others, all the meditations are very poor and distracting. Especially meditations guided by make members.

For better meditation, I will now shift to other applications",

            "The content and the way the app is designed is excellent. But I am facing problem in the app. It keeps on hanging and pausing and I cannot access any of the meditation videos. My internet speed is quite decent to open and play videos from other apps. Kindly request your help and support to resolve this issue",

Please not, in some guided meditations audio, music listening more loud than the voice, please try to keep balance between music and voice. It will be nice to hear soothing music with meditation audio. By the way, I am continuing to give infinite stars."

        "description": "★ Block apps at specific times during the week.\r\n★ View your app usage, going back up to 2 years.\r\n★ Limit app usage. Set a maximum daily usage per app, customizable per day of the week.\r\n★ Get weekly usage reports. See where your time went, and use it to stay in control of your phone usage.\r\n★ Strict blocking: once an app block is active it cannot be stopped.\r\n\r\n💪 Boost your productivity, stay focused, and improve your digital wellbeing!\r\nBlock is an easy-to-use Android application that improves your self-control by blocking or limiting your app usage and giving you insight into how your time is spent on your phone. Whether you need to focus on your 🎓 study, don't want to get distracted at 💼 work, can't go to 🛌 sleep at night, or want to be more 👥 social, this app can help you out.\r\n\r\n\r\n🕓 BLOCK SPECIFIC APPS AT SPECIFIC TIMES\r\nSelect a group of apps and create a custom time schedule during which these apps will automatically be blocked. The schedule is fully customizable, allowing you to set different times on different days in the week, allowing you to create productive habits. An active block cannot be turned off so that it prevents you from using distracting apps.\r\n⌛ You can temporarily activate your blocks at any time for a specific duration. Great for when you start a study session or want to go to sleep. Often combined with a Pomodoro timer for increased productivity.\r\n\r\n📊 VIEW APP USAGE\r\nYou can analyze your phone usage over different time periods, going back up to 2 years. See where your time is spent and take steps to improve your digital wellbeing.\r\n\r\n⏱️ SET DAILY USAGE LIMITS\r\nWasting time on social media, or watching too many YouTube videos? You can set a daily usage limit per app. When you reach the time limit, the app will be blocked for the remainder of the day. The limits are customizable per day of the week. For example, detox from Facebook by only allowing 30 minutes per weekday, limit Reddit to 20 minutes in the weekend, or block Whatsapp after 1 hour of messaging.\r\n\r\n📈 RECEIVE WEEKLY USAGE REPORTS\r\nAt the start of each week, you will receive an overview of your app usage of the week before. This contains a detailed breakdown of where your time was spent during the week, allowing you to easily decide which apps to restrict. You will be able to have more quality time and reduce your phone addiction, resulting in a better digital diet.\r\n\r\n🔒 STRICT APP BLOCKING\r\nBy default, the only option to access a blocked app is to reboot your phone. If that is too easy, you can disable this in the app's settings, such that even after a reboot your apps will still be blocked. This app uses the Device Administrator permission. The permission can (optionally) be enabled inside the app's settings to prevent the app from being force closed or uninstalled, such that there is no way to circumvent a block. Procrastinators, this app is made for you.\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\nAdditionally, you can place widgets on your home screen that allow you to start a block in a single tap. There is Tasker support to automate the starting of a block at any time.\r\n\r\nPrivacy\r\nNo personal information or app usage data is collected. All data stays on your phone.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\nPlease see the FAQ in the app for any issues with the app, or send an email to apps.wverlaek@gmail.com.",

            "I hope this is a temporary mistake but since the newest update (4.0+) where they've updated how blocks are structured, the free version is extremely limiting. 3 blocks allowed only, which used to be 3 scheduled blocks and unlimited app time limits. Now if I want to limit Facebook to 1 hour and YouTube to 2 hours, that's 2 blocks already. Very difficult to make this app useful now.",
            "When i close my phone and again open it Blocked apps also opens..... When i go to the main app i.e, (block apps-productivity) it shows some notifications like ' some background apps are killing'...... Little disappointed ☹️",
            "It is a v nice app. You can really check how much time u actually spend on social media and you wont even realise. Once your timer ends u cannot open it till it gets unlocked. So your daily time can be saved and you can really focus on yourself family and studies🌿",
            "Its an awesome app! You cannot unblock everything as per your wish unlike the other apps. Kudos to the creaters! I am able to get rid of my constant habit of using the apps for no use. It also displays a quote so you get inspired and are not guilty about it. Love, love 💜",
            "I've been using this app for about a year now and it's really helped me be productive again. Twitter, Reddit, Google News are distracting for me and block helps me stay focused on what's important during he day."

            "I love the option of purchasing (not \"borrowing\") packs you want instead of a ridiculous subscription price. I will add more packs as I need, but it's a great feature for those of us who don't want to pay $250 a year for a garbage meditation app no one uses 99% of. I like the guide's voice and the daily progress, not just repeating trash over and over like most apps. If you've looked at the other meditation apps and laughed at how useless they are, this may be your app.",
            "I have been using the app daily and it really has helped me to build a daily meditation routine. The instructions are clear, calm, positive. The process takes you step by step so you don't struggle while you build the foundations of your routine. You feel rested after the exercises. Day by day you start to feel changes in your mood, thoughts and energy.",
            "This is a wonderful, helpful app. I appreciate the organization and accessibility of this app. The meditations are easy to follow, and the guide has a soothing voice. I'm new to meditating, and the instructions are clear and well-timed throughout the meditations. The dark mode option is perfect for doing meditations right before bed. Longer meditations would offer even more variety (hour long affirmations or guidance to self-compassion, etc). Thank you for continuously improving the app!",
            "Very good app. I finally feel like I'm making progress and learning. I fall asleep relaxed and l'm calmer in heated situations. It's around 3.30e a month, so it's not a too bad, but I'm on week 2 and it feels a bit repetitive an you have to commit to 6 months. If I could pay monthly, I would be more inclined to go for it. You only get a week of free trial.",
            "This is mu fourth meditation in Serenity (I tried other apps before) and it's so good. It has an amazing repertoire of guided meditations, with a very soothing voice, relaxing music and great techniques to improve gradually. I recommend it to some friends already. I hope it will continue being for free for quite long. Thanks Serenity!"

I have very low self-esteem to the point that I call myself down all the time in a mirror, to myself, and i don't think anyone could ever come close to saying mean things about me than my own self. To continue, most of the time I hibernat, and struggle to even get out to do even the simplest things in life...even the things I used love too do. Above all, I find that I do enjoy this app and will take baby steps to improve.",

First page is Chapter 1. if you wonder why you can't go to next page because there's chapter 1A, chapter 1B and so on. For those who gave 5 🌟 in this app I love it. thank you so much. Reading your comments made me install this app.",

            "I use this app as my basic organiser. It's good enough that I've bought the lifetime subscription. The latest redesign is amazing. It's flexible and intuitive. A bug or two remain but they're minor and don't interfere with the strengths of the app. One thing I'd like to have is the ability to remove old entries, say with some sort of archiving to a file. Anyway, well done.",
            "It's really amazing, I wish we could record voice and save them as voice clips. I've looked for such a journal app but didn't find one. plus It would be cool if they had voice in to text option. And I really wish we could change fonts for free. Atleast a limited number of fonts. Other than that this is the best journal app from the ones I've tried! 😌 I'm editting this because I don't like the new UI of the timeline nopeeee!!!!! It was wayyyy more prettier before!!! 😭😭😭😭😭",
            "great app for journaling. I took away one star because while the new timeline view has some benefits like showing multiple photos and improvement to how the habits are shown the loss of the gradient effect is a step backwards in my mind. it used to look so unique. If you can bring back the gradient effect and incorporate some of the other improvements to the timeline you've made I think that will be a win-win.",
            "I've been using some top ranked Journal Apps to find what suits & best for my needs. One reason I used this App was its previous design; it had the best & most beautiful timeline interface, especially the gradient background color of the entry adjusting the attached image's main color combined with timelines connecting entries, but not anymore. I prefer the beautiful better old style design than the new simpler modern design. Another drawback: No Lifetime Payment. • A Monthly Subscriber.",
            "Ive really liked this app, it helps me stay organized but this newest update REALLY messed it up. I dont even know how to check off something on my to-do list anymore. Its so cluttered now. I preferred being able to see next weeks to-dos right away as well. I would really like to go back to the last update please."

I enjoy checking in everyday and one day will be able to look back on all my progress to hopefully help other addicts on they're new journey. Thank you all for ypur support. -Alyssa",
            "Love this app because not only does it have a sobriety counter but it also has a meeting finder that has a lot of listings for both in-person meetings of all kinds and zoom meetings. You can go to a meeting every hour. Not to mention that this app has a daily check-in as well as the option to record your triggers and cravings and you can keep note and a daily motivational affirmation picture oh and you can create your own affirmations put your own pictures behind it",
            "Have tried multiple recovery apps but this one is the best by a long shot. It's phenomenal! With the ability to record my feelings, any cravings, thoughts, and so much more, and share them all with my family and other support I feel like I'll finally be able to overcome my addiction. I'm not one for calling my support team but this app allows for them to comment on a log entry, message me 1-on-1, or send group messages. I highly recommend this app!",
            "This is really the BEST app I have ever used! It's better than i even hoped for, really. I have tried almost 30 other, I can't even say similar, apps but they are no contest! this has everything available all the time any time for any reason! you need to talk to somebody, or to find a meeting, or if you want to read resources or reach out to other people going through the same thing you are, this is the perfect app! I love it! Life changing amazing! thank you for creating it!",
            "Have not had this app very long but what I have got from this app so far i give 5 stars i love everything about this app when I tell me self oh I can do a certain part of my daily program which has been set outside of this app, it seems to fall right on time that this app reminds me that it's time to check in with myself and my recovery and this app prompts me to check in with a heck of a lot more than what I would normally ( but should be doing normally) so its a god send for me"

Easy to add tasks to either a single profile or multiple profiles. 3. Can set daily, weekly, or monthly repetition or rotations for task. 4. Very easy to organize task by profile or date. Con's: 1. Can't organize the task list very well. Neither Alphanumeric or Due Date changes the list correctly. 2. Cant' create rewards right now either. Hope this gets fixed or the app is not really functional or worth keeping. I did email the support team. Will update if I receive a response.",

            "I really love the concept of the app, especially the daily readings and being able to keep a journal. However, the journal needs some work. Sometimes the journal entry delete - and losing these is upsetting because I often can't recall what I went through a few days earlier. Also, you can't change the font and colour of the writing until you have written something and highlight it. Overall, the idea is lovely - just needs so minor touch ups from the tech side of it and it will be perfect!",
            "Overall good. The formatting in the journal could use some work, maybe provide the option to change the background color of the journal, the stark white is a bit unpleasant. What is urgently needed are repeatable tasks!!! I don't use Google Calendar, and have no desire to. Basically if the tasks and calendar functions aren't more fleshed out in this app, I won't be renewing my subscription when the time comes. It's nice, but I shouldn't have to rely on three or four apps just to be organized.",

            "Very easy and convenient to use. It offers a diary section to keep track of skills, emotions, vulnerabilities, self validation and so on. it also provides text boxes for comments.. There are several sections with reminders of skills to use in a crises, validation, and affirmations. This is a well thought out app and incorporates most aspects of dbt therapy. So nice to have at my finger tips; pretty much ensures that I'll practice and use dbt skills everyday.",
            "I love it! I have personality disorders and this app really helps me remember and keep track of my behaviors throughout the day. I used to just journal at night, but I've learned it saves your progress throughout the day. I'll go my diary card in the morning after my meditation, sometime mid afternoon or after lunch, and then again at night, sometimes twice. I'll also go while in crisis. I have really learned to stay more on track, using the various skills. It's great. I use with my therapist.",
            "I like it the best of all the diary cards because its neater and cleaner. My only issue is that I can't seem to send the diary card to my DBT coaches without having to download, save and send each day individually. I would prefer a more seemless way to forward and email the cards. Aside from that its a total game change for me to keep track of my skills."

        "description": "The Fun Routine is for children with Autism (ASD) to help with daily chores that seeks to help parents with children who have some form of difficulty understanding activities that are daily, such as children with Autism (ASD). With the help of this tool, it is possible to organize the child's daily chores, tasks and routines, where he or she can view a visual schedules and mark their chores as completed.\r\n\r\nThe Fun Routine is educational and encourages communication by providing a visual representation of the activity. It is quite simple, which makes it very easy to use, both for the parent and the child.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that it was designed for children with ASD, but it is suitable for any child, or even adults, who want to control their daily chores, assist in verbalization and / or encourage performing chores through reward.\r\n\r\nFun Routine Visual Schedules The Autism Helper\r\nChildren with Autism often have difficulty to structure their live and daily activities. \r\nThe sometimes have difficulty to give meaning to what they experience. A day can be full with separate incentives.\r\nPictures help our children make meaning of the words we are telling by providing a visual representation of the activity.\r\nEven readers benefit from the use of pictures\r\nActivities are lined up in the sequence they will be done.\r\nIt uses visual strengths and therefore provides a receptive communication system to increase understanding.\r\nIt helps the individual to learn new things and broaden their interests.\r\nHelps remain calm and reduces inappropriate behaviors.\r\nProvide spoken texts for people who have difficulty with reading\r\nHelp keep focus on the task at hand\r\n\r\nOur mission is to make working with visual day schedules fun, easy and simple. Try it our yourself, no obligations!\r\n\r\nFun Routine is daily planner for your chores and tasks. Set personal goals, track progress, and motivate yourself.\r\nFun Routne is not only a visual schedules, it’s an attitude, a commitment, a planner and achiever.\r\nJoin Fun Routine now and receive a marvellous self. Who knows the potential?\r\n\r\nTop features\r\nRegistration of daily chores at their due times with the option to mark them as completed. The system provides some chores previously registered, but it is possible to register your own chores and include the desired image.\r\nNotification of chores, tasks, routines, stating that it is time to perform the activity.\r\nReport of chores, tasks and routine performed.\r\n\r\nRewards\r\nReward systems rely on positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior. Here's how to make reward systems work for toddlers, preschoolers, and school-aged children.\r\nRewards can encourage your child’s good behaviors.\r\nThe way you respond right after your child’s behaviors makes the behavior more or less likely to happen again. Rewards can help get your child to do more of the things you want her to do. Rewards that happen right after a behavior are best.\r\nRewards can improve your relationship with your child.\r\nWhen you give a reward to your child, you and your child are both happy. You are happy because your child has done something you like. Your child is also happy because she is getting something she likes.\r\nReward system, where each completed chore is worth stars that can be exchanged for prizes registered by parents.\r\n\r\nPECS - Picture exchange communication system, which when touching the image, the application speaks the related word.

Also the mindfulness section only has 4 things to look at, it would be nice if more were added.",
            "i used clear fear for a while now and im so glad i found it because its really helping. i would give 5 stars if there wasnt this little problem that gets super annoying after while. if you log into the app the first time you answer some questions like selecting which part of the world ur from, set ur passcode and a security question and all of that stuff and i confirmed everything but if i open the app i have to answer all of the questions again, like i havent answered them. please fix that!!",
            "Good app, just two notes. When I try to type a text I cannot scrol the screen down enough to keep seeing the textbox. It disappears behind my keyboard. And I would like some excercises in it that are also in calm harm. It seems that app contains more coping strategies than just cbt and a breathing excercise it also has more interaction than clear fear. But it is a bit weird to read about harm when it is about anxiety. Another option would be to choose in the harm app what one is using it for.",
            "This was an ok app but there are only two things you can do to calm you down. A breathing activity and the same recording of a person telling you how to calm down. Other than that it's just an app to write down goals. There is also no option to record an attack after it happened and instead you must go through one of the activities and say that it helped so that you can record something. Even then it'll not show up for awhile until the week ends. There could be many improvements but its ok.",

However, I do realise that there is a bug that doesn't save your information when you close out of the application. Therefore, I would have to manually key in all my details from startup again. Other than the issue I mentioned, the application overall is great."

            "I read description of app and downloaded it with excitement. I was EXTREMELY disappointed when I could not \"Sign-up\" or \"Log-In\" at all, no matter all the methods I tried. I even uninstalled and downloaded again. Much to my dismay, I am now UNINSTALLING this app for good now. *UPDATE*I received 2emails, so at least an ATTEMPT was made to fix problem. But after 1st attempt failed, I communicated this back to developers, and have not heard/received any response.",
            "If you are looking for a select few mediations and not to pay anything-- THIS IS NOT THE APP FOR YOU. It first requires a account before it lets you in-- giving up privacy rights and my email-- when getting in-- it is like I could use YouTube for this small selection and not have the additional app space taken up. Uninstalled and unsubscribed.",
            "New to the world of meditation and I'm immediately impressed and feeling great! The courses available are plentiful, whether you have a couple minutes or much longer, there is a topic and length for everyone. Very happy that I made the decision to invest in myself and will be recommending Primed Mind to everyone I know. There's something to benefit anyone. Don't hesitate, go for it! You won't be disappointed!",
            "Loving this app. Use it pretty much every day. I would give 5 stars, some tweaking needed. When finishing a course, I am told it's completed - fine. But, a lot of these courses I would like to do again. I can,but I do not get the daily reminder/bookmark to show how much progress I have made on the repeated course. This is more than a little frustrating. Also, it would be nice for the app to bookmark more than 1 course concurrently. Finally, folks, I would call this a hypnotherapy app, not meditation. Good app."

            "although the free version has plenty of options it is extremely difficult to find them. it makes it seem almost as if you have to pay for it as soon as you open the app. I almost just straight up deleted it instead of trying it out or exploring it. The only reason why I explored it further was because my therapist reassured me it was free. and I do indeed enjoy it just would like it to be more user-friendly",
            "Every update hides the free features more and pushes you even further to purchase the yearly subscription. I love using this app but I get more and more frustrated at the difficulty of using it. The new UI is clunky and annoying, and even though it's my favorite meditation app, I recommend it less with every update. This is especially problematic for emergencies like panic attacks.",
            "New update messed it all up. Loved it before, now not much I have been subscribed for about 8 months and using it daily several times...now new update messed it all up. Of course they updated it and made me adapt...darn...lol I love this app. Back to 6 stars. ADDED. I've noticed if I leave it running all day when not using it...it eats my battery, so remember to turn it off after use.",
            "Correction 10/2020: I still love the app and still use it, but last update caused me so much frustration. My most used filters are gone: \"most listened\" and \"only misic\".Please please return these . This is my most important app! I use it every day for almost 4 years and it's only getting better and better! Absolutely essential for both those, who are just starting the meditation practice and those, who already have one. This app contains an amazing variety of all possible meditation practices.",

I was told about it from my yoga instructor and I love how much free content and huge selection there is. I do wish you could search emotions using your own words, not their preselected words. But this app has so much variety and it's free!! ❤️ Last update in October 28, has messed up sending messages \"thank you for mediating with me\""

            "I love writing down the reasons I'm grateful every day and this app reminds you to do it daily. There are also options for you to outline how something could be worse, or ultimate goals, and its a powerful way for you to train your brain to find the good in everything.",
            "I really enjoy this app. I love it. Thank you! One thing that I would like added is daily goals, so that I can write in a few simple goals for my day every morning. I do the gratitude exercise at night and use the other prompts randomly.",
            "I have had this app for several years now. I love its features and content. However, I have not used it for weeks at a time since the notifications do not work at all since the beginning. I have tried reinstalling the app, i chose personalized times for notifications, i checked my phone settings for allowing notifications, everything should work, but i still never get any reminders.This has been quite frustrating as I would love to get reminders. I also could not contact through the email.",

Removing 1 star because the app is not detecting 'Microsoft SMS Organizer' app, which is a bummer, because I cannot whitelist it to show its notifications immediately. As a result, I cannot see the SMSes as they arrive if I've set Microsoft SMS Organizer as my default messaging app.",

There is a bug that somehow pressing the notification items in the Daywise inbox does not open the corresponding app properly for some apps. If the bug could be fixed, the app will be perfect for me.",
            "Loved this app for a long time, really helps me be productive despite mental illness, and it actually helped my anxiety by not having notifications cluttering my phone, yet I wouldn't miss important things and could decide when to deal with them. However, i just cannot afford the cost and i just don't know how I'm going to get by without this app.",
            "This app is helpful and I paid for a subscription, but this morning the notifications I have set to receive in a batch started popping up instantly on their own. I triple checked the settings and nothing has changed. So basically the app isn't working today.",
            "Previously gave 5 stars for this great app, but there was a notice that the app would go paid subscription in 6 days. I understand that developing the app isn't free, and I'd be happy to support by paying a one time a fee, but I am unwilling to pay a subscription for this app. It's possible that you'll again increase the cost going forward. I'll be uninstalling and searching for alternatives over the next few days..."

            "This game helped me relax with no ads or nonesense and I feel like they really do care about you, even if you don't play it. It was a tad hard to pluck the hair but it made it a lot more fun. I'd recommend this game if you like relaxing stuff, unless you hate plucking hairs. The arm and hair is fine but everything else has a bit of black on it though if i had to knock it on anything it would be that. Thank you for reading this!",
            "It's kinda weird you pull out hairs and it's about emotions. The graphic is terrible but that adds to the feeling of this app and the voice is so endearing. This whole app is endearing. It feels like your pure friend trying to cheer you up with cheesy remarks and jokes. Sorry I can't give you guys any money but keep it up. Also, no ads at all.",
            "For me its hard to find games like this and i love games that are different for popular games and games that most people know about. But this game is super cool i know it might seem like you just plucking hair but its actually a really nice game so i hope you guys enjoy it as much ad i do.",
            "I thought this game was very creative and calming to play, it was a short game, but a very enjoyable game, and i loved the voice it was very funny to hear and helped to convey what they were saying!!! I also love how there were no ads, except for maybe twice the entire game to ask me to donate, so they can continue with no ads!!! So thus game is definitely amazing!!!",
            "Game seems broken. Very first thing to do and it doesn't work. Colored point to tap appeared, tapped it, then I couldn't do anything. Couldn't pull down, couldn't pinch with two fingers like the image showed, nothing but move it to one side."

            "So far so good. No limit to goals to track, each day can add note. Simple UI. Free version comes with ads. But, no export tool, and I might be bias but I still prefer Timecap UI.",
            "Nice and easy to set up! Visually clean, not cluttered. Needs a backup pdf or Excel or something for export to my own Dropbox etc. .... App works great, but on my \"pretty please\" wishlist I would request, weekly, number of times per week, and number of specified days per week/month. Also change sort order, such as frequency, color, and alphabetical/numerical. Categories too.",
            "Simple, nice interface. The functionality is basic, just enough to track your daily habits. The free version allows for many habits, and if you sign in you can get your data backed up. I wish the size of the squares/grids could be adjustable, would love to fit more habits within the screen without scrolling. Would prefer a one click-done function instead of going into specific habit page to mark it done, so you can check multiple habits at once.",
            "Love love love the simplicity of this tracker so far. It's the closest thing to exactly what I need that I've found so far. I would enjoy some refinement and further features, as well as some way to remove advertisements, but still great so far.",

            "Honestly, I haven't even gone through reading all the texts in the information section, and I can say that I already like the app! 😊 The explanations and the amount of information that is given are excellent and I think that this app could be really beneficial for anyone struggling with these problems. In the least, it could help with putting one's thoughts into perspective, which is a great aid in itself.",
            "Good resource, but it needs to also include positive moods and their effects so people don't fixate on the negative or develop the sense that things are always bad. I was peaceful sitting outside in the sunshine but had no way to log this and remind myself how to achieve peace or conjure positive memories.",
            "this app is very useful in controlling and helping negative thoughts by guiding you into logical reasoning. soon, you'll learn how to stop your own spiraling thoughts. probably saved my life a half a dozen times. :)"

If you move a couple of meters from a location it will mark it as a new location, so you should be able to merge different locations that are only some meters apart. Also I'd love to see a pie chart of the total amount of time spent on different activities (sleep,places etc) today, this week, month, year or all time. If this can be implented i think this app deserves a 5 star rating!",

Judging by the way some of the other ratings I breifly read through...other phones seem to be having specific data related discrepancies as well. Perhaps a way to manually to manually enter data ourselves and a breakdown of how it's recording or measuring its data so we could manually edit its data would be a way to mitigate the common issues...",

However, I wish there were some certain features within the app. 1) I wish there was a way to save all the images to my gallery. This would be very useful I cases where I would want to read some hacks later. 2) whenever I share a life hack only the first slide/page appears on whatever platform I choose. Anyways, hats off to the developers. You guys did an amazing job, I would definitely recommend this to others.",

The app opens up, then there will be three dots moving like a wave trying to open that hack up and it goes on forever.... very irritating... so i have changed my rating.

A second reason for giving a 3 rating is that some quotes are repeated 2 or more times on a list. Currently, I'm still viewing quotes, however I may stop because a lot of the Millionaire Sayings do not meet my values.",

I am very thankful to developer and teams of this app who made this beautiful app. Whenever I used to loose my hope and develop negative things on my mind.

            "Takes a really long time to load the quotes when you open the app, The graphics that come with the quote are quite distracting. It also doesn't give you the option to not like a quote. I might keep the app if it weren't for the terribly show load time.",

            "I have only been using this app for a few days and it has been very helpful. The meditations and breathing exercises are short and sweet with option sound and vibrations to help keep you on task. I am very happy with the journal as well! I like the option to pick emotion stickers for the day and answer simple questions vs freestyle (although you have 2000 characters for that too).",
            "I've been using this app for a little under a week and have been finding it pretty helpful so far. Haven't had the need to try out the panic button yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the rest of the app seems helpful. That said, I am very confused as to how I can have a \"20 day Journal streak\" when I've only had the app for about five days. It's doesn't impact the function at all, but it is a very strange glitch on the gameification side of things.",
            "I have read through the information provided and found it very useful. It is very clear and easy to understand how to use the app. Even though I haven't yet taken out their paid subscription, there are still activities you can do for free. I have found so far, this to be the best Anxiety/Panic Attack App I've come across.",
            "Absolutely love this app. Would be rad if there was a chatbot like woebot or self-education quizzes to help understand ourselves & our issues. Only thing I'd change is hiding the stuff only paid users can access. Maybe prevent accidently clicking on a premium feature by having all the free features in 1 area? Being reminded we're too poor to access features that could help us, is depressing & anxiety provoking.",
            "Had an issue signing up but the rootd IT team was quick to resolve my issue. The app is very helpful and I would certainly recommend it to others that are struggling with anxiety and panic attacks."

            "I am using the paid version and I love it! I love the reminders and the lessons. I especially love the recipes and the fact that you have a TON of vegetarian options. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that recipes get removed! I plan my meals a week in advance and I went today to prepare one and the 3 of the recipes are gone! There also isn't an option to download a .pdf to save for later. Please fix this and i will rate 5 stars!",
            "Great app. I've experimented with IF in the past, with great success. However, with COVID and working from home, it's a lot easier to slip up and eat whenever you want to. This app pops up periodically reminding me that I need to drink water. It's nice to have a reminder, which should prevent me from mindlessly eating when I'm not scheduled to. My first foray into IF was about 2 years ago, and I lost 85lbs in total. I'm not quite where I was before, but I'm still dealing with about 50 extra lbs. This app is highly recommended, as long as you use it as intended.",
            "Great app, takes a little learning. I was initially confused by the words encouraging me to 'End Fasting' when I was only hours into current fast. This resulted in a few badly timed fast records, but the ability to edit fasting start and end times saved me. I often forget to record my water intake, despite the much appreciated reminders from the app. The retroactive edit ability for water intake does not allow me to click on a day and edit. No response when I try to select a day's water record.",
            "Easy and Convenient app. I love that I can see my progress so easily!! I wish I could connect to my community though. It disappeared as quickly as it appeared???? I also wish I could communicate with my fasting buddies, at minimum send them an emoji or something. I use the paid version so I'm not sure what I'm getting that's any different than the free version... I don't use the recipes or the tools, I just use the trackers. All in all I'm happy I have the app though to stay on track.",
            "Love this app. I'm using the free version. There are enough features to get you started on IF. You enter basic info about yourself & they suggest a plan. You can modify the IF hours. Cool feature shows start/stop times. During fast you can see at a glance how long you've fasted/and time left. Reminders to drink water w/place to log amount. Didn't rate 5 stars because I wear an off brand fitness tracker (not listed on app) so steps are not recorded & no way to manually enter steps taken."

            "Simple & easy to use, but the main problem for me is that I can only choose for how often I set my goals for. For example, if I have the goal \"Get to work before 8am\", there is no way to manually unselect the days/weeks when the goal does not apply such as holidays, sick days... If I leave those days unmarked (=did not reach the goal) they will falsify my statistics. It's so bad for me that you don't have this feature. :-( Please fix it! Also I need widgets for the home screen & progress bars!",
            "Seems to meet my needs. However the \"My Goals\" should have an add goal button. The \"Goal Store\" tab is silly and unintuitive. You're not buying a goal your setting them. When I see my list of goals I should be able to add one without having to go to another tab. It would also be useful to add categories. Something like setting a house cleaning goal doesn't seem to fit into the three provided categories. Also please let me put in a percentage of how much is done when I add a task.",
            "This app used to be good. Far more flexibility and way of tracking progress under the free version. It then had a revamp and took many things off the free version and I lost one of my goals which I had been following for some time, when the developers cut the free version from 5 goals to 4. I understand they may have done this to boost their income: that's fine, but by making the free version worse, this is no invitation to pay for the premium. A big shame.",
            "When I first signed up it was great, I set notifications to come up to remind me of my commitments and keep me accountable. Now the notifications no longer work it's pretty pointless. I've contacted the developer both in the forum and by using the contact email address and got no response and no fix. Shame really as it was useful before this all stopped working.",
            "Love it! I deducted 1 star because the app doesn't have widgets. A suggestion to the developers: the ability to set a period for a single habit (e.g. I want to brush my teeth two times a day for 3 months) cuz I want to build a habit to do it constantly forever, but I don't want to track it forever. Would be nice to have a progress bar for the period as well. Overall, love the app. I would totally recommend it."

(2)Allow multiple resilience slots for quests and power-ups. Example: \"having a hard conversation\" is both good for emotional & mental. (3)More variety of completion music. The fanfare is annoying. (4)More artwork & personalized avatars. It helps our imagination and reward centre when we see our imaginary selves.",

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

            "I have tried many shopping list / pantry management applications in the past few months, and Grocy combined with this application turned out to be the most convenient solution. The shopping mode is awesome, and the barcode scanner - which, for some reason, I thought I would never use - also works really well. And to top it all, this is all open source. I love it. Thank you for creating and maintaining this application!",
            "Please add ability to attach pictures to products. It seems to be supported by the server, but not this app. EDIT: I am not familiar with the API. I take it does not expose ability to upload pictures?",
            "Intuitive to setup and works like a charm. Great helper when dealing with barcodes and Grocy inventory. Offline shopping list support!!! Under active development so new features (and occasional bugs and their fixes) come regularly.",
            "Seems to work well, unfortunately can't use it as the app doesn't seem to like ports other than port 80. Please allow us to change which port is used!",
            "Hi, I cannot connect the app to the server. I have this message : An error occured. URL is ok. I can reach the site via a web browser on the same device. API Key is Valid to. What happened please ?"

        "description": "The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\r\n\r\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\r\n\r\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

I will give it some time, if ads are still an issue, I will probably delete, I wouldn't mind paying for premium, with no ads, but currently not an option.",
            "I love this app. I dont usualky rate apos, but have found this one worthy of a rate. The ads are not to annoying, but the quotes are really amazing, inspiring and very relevant at times 😂 I love how you can listen to various types of hypnosis' and meditations, whether guided or musical, that cover a varitety if topics. Would definately recommend this app!!",
            "I really enjoy these. The updates have helped with the crashing. I wish those with music would keep repeating like they did briefly but an update stopped that. They have been very helpful to overcome abusive brain washing and help me to better use the law of attraction to change my life. I love it. Thank you!",

I would love to have the option to upgrade to an add free version. The adds really detract from all the wonderful aspects of the app.",

            "Great app. You need a way for videos to play continuously, so maybe when you are running, working out, you know, when you are trying to motivate yourself, you could use this app. 4 mins at a time is no bueno. Sadly, YouTube is better. At least they play videos one after the other. Even of you must deal with limited commercials. Fantastic idea. Needs a little tweeking. 👍👍",
            "The app has to be open in order for the content to play. It makes it useless if you want to use it while working out, or for any other activity that doesn't require keeping the phone open. I paid for the premium version which gets rid of ads. That works. But until they take the videos off of the YouTube platform, it will have this limitation... And my 1 star rating.",

            "A useful app, keeps the mind active, although I have two main observations: the first is that the training 'games' are in fact testing your knowledge in relation to 'speed'. All tasks are time sensitive, and you are encouraged to answer or respond to actions in as short as time as possible. I'm sorry, that is not necessarily going to improve an individuals grammar or math in any way. Secondly, there should be a way to choose your level, (or beginner to advanced)",
            "Love it! So good! Currently doing maths and English at college so this in my spare time or just whenever I fancy a little phone time is ideal! Unfortunately I don't wanna buy the full version yet! Quite pricey! But I'm sure i will at some point! Maybe if it had a little monthly subscription I'd be more up for it. But yea, for now I will enjoy the free version until I can splurge out. I'll keep an eye out for a price drop also",
            "I wouldn't necessarily say it is a brain training app, more of what you understand at a point of time. Due to the timer in the games, you never really take in the mistakes you make, so nothing gets retained. Also, some of the games are really boring, I lose interest half way through a lot of the times and I have to restart them.",
            "This is very sophisticated, very artful, beautiful to see, and fun. Good algorithm's for challenging you based on your progress - just enough to keep you egaged and learning without being discouraged. There is a large number of activities . VERY clever design of games. I \"train\" (play) daily. I have learned things that I have used elsewhere. I am 67 years old too.",
            "This is a really good app! I have to say it's never crashed my phone before and it uses very little battery. However recently I've had to change this review as my training streak had mysteriously disappeared even though I have done my session everyday. It was up to about 130 days so I am hoping you will put it back as I have emailed twice. You said you have replied to me via email however I have not received an email on the dates you have said to have said to have sent one."

            "Really disappointed waiting over a year for ability to use it on the computer as well. Instead of development for individual browsers. Just make a website so one can prep an entry. From there would be happy to edit on the phone... This really isn't something that should be in the pipeline. It's a must until you can provide individual browsers support.",
            "This is a good Journaling app. It's an amazing one on iOS. There in lies the frustration for most. We see what it can be, and feel almost cheated that the Android version is missing features. Maybe create a Beta version to allow users to test things out for you, or perhaps better communication with your customers here. There should be a clear laid out road map on when features will be included. This is to appease your users, plus hold yourselves accountable. Here's hoping for the best.",
            "The only thing that could make this app better as far as I am concerned is the ability to print books from the Android user face I looked forward to the day when that can happen.",
            "Coming from ios this is completely disappointing. It's almost unusable... can't see myself renewing subscription for such a broken port. I see responses mentioning forming an android team and building s roadmap and having news in two months. Sorry guys it's too little far too late and how you've managed to neglect this product for so long whilst asking people for money to maintain a yearly subscription is beyond me. Extremely poor business sense.",
            "I've used this app for a couple years now. I paid for the annual subscription so that I could store photos. Due an entire year, the subscription cost is completely with it to me. It has some quirks though, like how it has never handled lists with much finesse, and auto detecting when it should capitalize a word on a newline or on a list isn't always correct. Still good overall though at the this time of writing."

            "Nice idea, could improve. Some of the hacks are common sense, others are really useful. It would be good to have the option to save or pin your favourites in one place. At the moment you'd have to choose the category and go through them all agon to find the one you want. I also don't like that it doesn't link directly to Google play to leave a review, unless you give a thumbs up and say that you're going to give 5 stars so think reviews may be biased.",
            "I love reading the tips. To repeat, some are obvious but some, I cant believe I hadnt thought of them. I have tried many. Im confused on one in the pet tips. It says \"Heres recipies for.. \" i tried a few things to see if I could be transferred to another place, including sending the tip to myself and opening the app that way. Any recipies? I would lower stars for a few things besides this but I think this app is awesome in general. Research, probably trying everything, I love reading them.",
            "I use this app more often than I'd like to admit lol... My only issues are: #1 I have daily tips turned on but I don't always get a daily tip & #2 when I get a daily tip that's long worded it cuts off & then if I click on view more the app opens to the main categories selection page & then it's hard to find the tip I was reading My ideas for improvement are: #1 Tips should be easier to find & #2 The view more button should open the app to that specific tip/hack Still thanks for a great app!!",
            "Certain Area's and Sections of this application need to be Updated. For Example: the \"Self Defense\" section of this APP. needs Updating. I will say that I think This is a great app. but it needs to be kept \"current\" especially with all the similar Competing Apps. that are like your application. Thank You for the work you've done to make this application. 🙂 A few tweaks & Updates and I'd give you 5 🌟's for sure. ( :",
            "It's pretty good,and then you guys can still improve knowing that all the wonderful effort you made putting these marvelous app together will definitely be challenged since many relatively the same apps are in circulation, thus the need for improvement on certain areas such as self defense among others. Well-done and God bless."

            "Best app of its kind. I initially got the app for binaural beats and have slowly built up my inventory. I've been using Glenn's meditations for about 2 yrs now and love every one. I've notice improvement in any area I use these for with nightly, consistent use. Highly recommend for inner balance and higher quality of mind and life.",
            "Thats fantastic, it would be nice to have more of a selection of like binaural tracks and meditation music you can play after a hypnosis track. And I wish the tracks were a little cheaper because I won't run my bill up hundreds to download the entire content but I am very interested in hearing them..",
            "I use this app all the time it works I do have a request though. It would be much better.. When you select to repeat your selection over and over;. please fix it so it doesn't start with disclaimer for driving while listening or descrobing what you expect.. I'm usally relaxed or asleep at that point and it startles me when it starts over. If repeat is selected I suggest forwarding it to a soothing point of the session. 5 stars if done. Thanks either way love your work.",
            "I made a Playlist of important tracks followed by the relaxation and sleep track with a sleep ending. I am a worrier and have never been good at falling asleep. However, I have noticed a huge improvement in my sleep habits. I will be sharing this app with my team of doctors because one had asked me who I use. I'm really pleased with the app! The price isn't bad, either. I bought a few hypnosis CDs, too. These tracks are more effective and cheaper than the CDs.",
            "This app gives a wonderful feeling with all its musical effects and suggestions.. My heart rate was reduced considerably at the end of session which means am getting really relaxed. I heard some of them were not able to listen to the complete audio as they fell asleep within 10 mins. Keep doing good job."

Wife and I used to use it often without issues, but recently I made another account and when I try to enter a property im told my account is suspended for suspicious activity? On the same day I made it?? Anyways, wife downloaded it on her phone and it wouldn't send the code to her #. Tried to contact customer service and got no help there either.",
            "The ability to tour houses on your own time is great. Good selection, at least in a metro area. App has some bugs but overall works well. Knocked off a star because I got randomly locked out of my account when trying to tour houses. Have to wait 72 hours because of \"suspicious activity\" with no way to speed up the approval.",
            "Concept is cool, implementation and customer service are a disaster. Went to a property, had a rently account asked for I'd photos. App had no method to input them. Try their customer service chat, they told me to download the rently app that I was texting them on. Tried to call their customer service number, was told to simply email them tried their sales line, got a repeat message of\" you have reached the sales office\" I lost money today, and it is because of rently.",
            "Requires photo ID and matching selfie and won't let you upload them. Did all troubleshooting and submitted a support request and they said they fixed it and it still had the same problem. I had others try and they had the same problem. This app is garbage.",
            "Property Management companies should be cautious. Rently has too many errors. It's extremely frustrating. I spent hours with tech support, being told they reset my account...and continue to have the same problems.I used Rently on 3 different phones. I was relocating and drove 6.5 hours 2x to view a house before I could apply. Rently told me to contact the leasing company...Mainstreet Renewals referred me back to Rently. I opted to use an agency not associated with Rently."

When I try to schedule the filling of the envelopes in advance, it shows the envelope fill and deposit right away. For example, I put in 8/6 as the date for the paycheck and envelope fill, but it shows immediately in my checking balance and envelopes. Why have the option for a future date if it shows it immediately? This will make reconciling my checking account with the app's balance more difficult."

            "There's just not a lot of variety when it comes to the content. I expected way more when you sign up for a subscription. Also, for what you DO get, the meditation are average at best...... Money wasted 😕",
            "Love meditating! This app really helps me focus on the meditation as it guides you through the process for each one. I do however, think that the prices are very costly and I am on low income budget. As traditional medications either do not work, have too many interactions with other medications, and having extreme adverse reactions to medication, I do use meditation and other integrative therapies. Also, I would like to see muscle relaxation meditations.",
            "Wish there was ZERO STAR option. Terrible business. Created a \"plan\" for me and once I paid to get said plan, the plan needed me to buy EXTRAS to access \"plan\"!!! SCAM. SHAM. SHAME ON YOU!!",
            "Very calming, and I enjoy the fact that it's timed and they walk you through the whole meditation!"

I don't want to have to keep looking at the app while I'm trying to have quality time with my kids. But I do want us to stay on schedule.",
            "Thus is an amazing app! I don't know how they made it,but it helped me really improve.even though I'm already a pretty steady and organized person,this actually makes me feel good about me,my day,but the only 3 cons I really have to yell out is, 1. Sometimes after I finish a task,it plays it over again,thus gets in my way,so bare this in mind. 2. It takes long to load sometimes which wastes time. 3.you can't add another kid,and it will say already joined if you sign in a different device.",

            "Love this app. I started using Joseph's hypnosis app fine years ago with the onset of severe panic attacks that were disabling my life and ability to function. After a few times I achieved a magical trance and could see improvement in my life. I also use therapy and mindfulness to manage my mental health along with the app. Years later I still use and recommend to everyone.",
            "I love the hypnosis tracks, but they don't play correctly. I can't play them through my audible account and the Google music freaks out whenever I try to turn off my screen. I didn't have this problem until about a year ago and it really makes this hard to use.",
            "Tried the 2 of the free audios which are very good. But none of the audio from the Free Tab will download, keeps saying not enough free space, check sd card.",
            "I've been using it for years! I recommend to all my friends who are dealing with stress along with all my high school students especially now dealing with the covid 19 pandemic.",
            "I was very impressed with the free trial sessions so I bought some of the longer sessions. Yesterday the app started crashing repeatedly and I have been unable to listen to purchased sessions. Very frustrating...... However, having contacted Joseph Clough by e-mail I received a response very quickly with a suggested fix."

            "Listening to my first download on chapter 3 already. I love the book I chose but I feel like I will read through all of the selections pretty quickly as they don't have as many options as I might've thought. It is annoying having to exit out of the adds after every download. Reader sounds clear for the most part with somewhat of an accent which might be easier to understand what he's saying if it we're just a tad slow possibly? The book I selected does have some complex vocabulary here and there",
            "I love this app. It got me started on my path of listening to spoken words rather than music. Though I have downloaded many of the books it was \"The science of being well\" that I started with and still believe it to be the most valuable of my collection.

It’s all about keeping the right thoughts top of mind from the get-go every day, so they’re readily available on those hard days when you need them most.\r\n\r\nWhether you're going through hard times, need an extra push to get stuff done, or like sharing inspirational quotes in social media, Motivation has you covered.\r\n\r\nShare the uplifting message of the day with your friends, or use the image for Instagram or as a wallpaper.\r\n\r\nThe app includes a wide range of topics such as self-esteem, relationships and dealing with stress, as well as a selection of carefully designed themes to choose from - updated every hour.\r\n\r\n+ Set Motivational Reminders throughout the Day\r\n+ Save your Favorite Quotes\r\n+ Filter Quotes by Category\r\n+ Search quotes\r\n+ Save directly to the device\r\n+ Beautiful quotes to uplift your mood\r\n+ High+quality chakra videos to meditate\r\n+ Beautiful wallpapers\r\n+ Stress relief\r\n+ Anger management\r\n+ Helps with anxiety\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sign ups.

Learning to control your depression often depends, in part, on how you can control your anger.\r\n\r\nHow anger management quotes can help you?\r\n\r\nYou might think that venting your anger is healthy, that the people around you are too sensitive, that your anger is justified, or that you need to show your fury to get respect. But the truth is that anger is much more likely to damage your relationships, impair your judgment, get in the way of success, and have a negative impact on the way people see you. That’s where anger management comes in.\r\n\r\nThe goal of anger management?\r\n\r\nMany people think that anger management is about learning to suppress your anger. But never getting angry is not a good goal. Anger is normal, and it will come out regardless of how hard you try to tamp it down. The true goal of anger management isn’t to suppress feelings of anger but rather to understand the message behind the emotion and express it in a healthy way without losing control. When you do, you’ll not only feel better, you’ll also be more likely to get your needs met, be better able to manage conflict in your life, and strengthen your relationships.\r\n\r\nThe app provides users with education about anger, opportunities for finding support, the ability to create an anger management plan, anger tracking, and tools to help manage angry reactions.\r\n\r\n+ Anger Management For Teens\r\n+ Coping Skills For Anger\r\n+ How To Deal With Frustration\r\n+ How To Deal With Angry People\r\n+ Anger Management Guide\r\n+ Anger Management Techniques\r\n+ Anger Management Exercises\r\n+ How To Control Anger Outbursts\r\n+ How To Control Anger And Stress\r\n+ How To Deal With Anger\r\n+ How To Release Anger\r\n+ Anger Management Tips\r\n+ How To Control Your Emotions\r\n+ Anger Management For Kids\r\n+ Anger Management Therapy\r\n+ How To Stop Being Angry\r\n+ How To Calm Down When Angry\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: All images are copyright of their perspective owners.

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

Though the app as some defects but the content ( the wisdom) is over whelming and testable. It explores difference strategic aspect of power and people in general. I rate the app 5 stars for detailed, structured and creative. The developer as my full support , keep on the good work. If you don't believe download the app , and see for yourself.",

            "so, this is a abbreviated version of the actual book. the original is actually very interesting to read as it provides a historical analysis and examples which this one does not. just the rules, better off to just read the table of contents. YouTube the audiobook. of course living in this way is a sad way of living, but I think that reading about it is no different than reading machiavelli or Lao tso.",

            "I actually downloaded this app because I wanted to say something about what I read just previewing the app and I'm definitely not impressed! Unfortunately this is the kind of ugly thinking of people in this world! Not to say it doesn't happen all the time but it's exactly what's wrong with this would not what's right! If everyone in the world thought like this what an awful place it would be! If you want something to live by try the good book! You can get a copy anywhere! It's called the BIBLE! Now that's the laws to live by! You can have power by being good as well as bad! It all depends on who you serve in this world God or Satan!"

            "Disappointing! I downloaded this app and expected a tool which helps me to build good habits, builds a structure by tracking them and so on. What I got was basically an archive of articles how to build habits. I don't need an app for that. I read a book \"The power of habits\" or search the internet. There is some sort of habit tracking functionality. But it's totally unclear. There is no tutorial explaining the app. Somewhere in the menu is a Habit Tracker under which you find some options which is just an unclear list of strange names. They need to explain better what they are offering if anything beside a collection of articles.",
            "I love starting out my day by reading two articles in an area I want to focus on. Lately, it's been habit formation, increasing productivity, and business growth. I love this app archives all these articles for me so I'm not spending valuable time looking for them myself. Instead, I just need a lot of coffee, read the articles, and set my goals for the day. I love it! I can already start to see a large difference in my life. I'm sure my clients can too.",
            "I was impressed with the thoughtful, thorough reviews that were clearly genuinely posted by users of the app. What prompted me to download however was developer's response to one obviously phony 1-star \"review\" clearly planted by a troll. The app itself is simple to use and everything an individual striving to live his/her best life could hope for. Interesting, positive, motivating, and informative articles to start every day out on a positive note, in a couple of minutes a day. Great work!",
            "One of the best app ever!!! It has really good positive articles, gives a boost to my mind at any given time. Everybody should definitely give it a try, it's a much better idea to invest your valuable time to read something useful other than the usual gossips or not required demotivating matters",
            "not matter what habit you may be trying to change, or even trying to start, this app breaks it down, providence simple step by step guidance that makes so much sense, i almost can't so no to at least trying one or two of the things i wanted to change... and over the course of a few weeks i gradually actually starting DOING what i sat around and had been \"trying\" to do for months!!! I KNOW that was a big run on sentence, but if you do what is advised...and you want it....you will understand!!"

            "Hello I enjoy the app and feel it is one of the best out here. However, I would love to see the simple features of being able to: 1. Set the back ground image to an image of my own choosing like you can on Android phone's home screen or lock screen.  2. Allow you to like someone's text in a group chat.  3.  Allow you to add an remove ppl from group chats without having to create a new group.  Thanks",
            "Years after my last review, I still use this app daily. This really is the best messaging app out there. Still doesn't support sending videos, for some weird reason, but it's a solid app, backs up messages directly to the Android message store, allows you to customize the background, foreground, text bubbles, even the app icon. If you're one of those people whose default messenger doesn't let you send you send full-sized images, Textra is the only one I've found that lets me do this.",
            "Textra is the ONLY messenging app I will ever use! It's easy to use. You can customize EVERYTHING. Like the colors you use for every contact. You can set up Textra exactly how YOU want it to be. You can change the ring tones for every contact. There are 3 types of emojis you can use. I use IOS even though I have an Android phone. If you have an idea that you think might make Textra better, send them your idea and they may use it. If you need support-it's there. I love, love, love it!",
            "I have been using textra for years, always loved it, but here within the past day or so, chat heads are now popping up for new message notifications while I'm currently in the middle of messaging someone else. When you click to open the chat head it doesn't allow you to do anything, so you have to drag it to bottom to close it. Please how do I disable this feature, it's unpleasant and unwelcomed.",
            "When switching phones I ended up having trouble sending mms messages. When Textra support was contacted they were prompt in answering and emailed back and forth with me to try and fix the problem. Ultimately it was the cell providers/SIM card that was causing the issue. I have used the app for many years and on several different phones. I will continue to use this app and recommend it to everyone. Thank you for the help and a great app. Special thanx to Mandy and Max👍👍"

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "This is a trial and needs a paid subscription. Their prices are the most expensive of any subscription on the play store. Why would you pay thousands of dollars for modules that no longer work",
            "Fantastic lifechanging app. I am so happy I found it and although I am still learning on how to use it best, I have already noticed several improvements using my time and getting things done. The additional training provided by mail is great as it gives you a lot of ideas and information to think about. Very impressed by all the thoughts put in the app and how well it works.",
            "Nice, but OVERCOMPLICATED! Not for the average user. It feels very personalised, like it is someone's life or brain that they have laid out in an app. The idea is definitely there, but it needs some simplification. I really want to use it, but trying to get my head around setting a goal, then adding a task, which category or value it goes in?? By the end of it feel more confused than hopeful I'm so sorry to say. Just some constructive feedback for the designers, and nothing personal.",
            "Wow!! Love Goalist! I'm not using all of the functionality yet but it's helped me tremendously for the past month. Already have my level 3 subscription and will continue to use it. Be patient with yourself at first as the scheduling is different than how most are used to. Believe me though it's worth it!!",
            "Functionality could use a lot of work. Creating tasks doesn't feel simple and you end up in a rabbit hole of submenus. Also, Goalist seems grossly inaccurate as the app focuses on micro managing each and every day, only showing one day at a time. I don't see a list of goals in the future and accessing them is very difficult. Then there's your notifications being read out by some automated reader, not easy to disable either. Trial, full access, but I don't feel like buying anything. Too complex."

It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",

I'm having a few other problems though - when adding new items to the board I can't subscribe other members to this item (I can do this on my computer so I have the permissions), also tags not activating on updates, and I can't find the option to edit updates.

Thus, CPU usages unfortunately won't work on devices with Android Oreo. I have released a beta version of the app accommodating the rooted Android Oreo devices where it should work just fine. Do post feedback or send me an email if the BETA version doesn't work on your rooted Oreo device. Thanks!\r\n*** END UPDATE ***\r\n\r\n*** UPDATE regarding Active Processes monitor on Android Nougat and up ***\r\nI have released a beta version of the app with Active Processes monitor working on devices with ROOT access. You'd need to become a beta tester in order to install it. It may be a bit buggy. Any feedback is appreciated, thanks!\r\n*** END UPDATE ***\r\n\r\n*** NOTE*** \r\nSome features of Simple System Monitor does not work properly with android version 6.0 and up because of the underlying system changes.\r\nAlso, as of Android Nougat, Active Processes tab will show only one app, Simple System Monitor itself.

        "descriptionHTML": "*** UPDATE regarding CPU usage for Android Oreo and up ***<br>So Android Oreo added yet another restriction disallowing access to the CPU usage stats. Thus, CPU usages unfortunately won&#39;t work on devices with Android Oreo. I have released a beta version of the app accommodating the rooted Android Oreo devices where it should work just fine. Do post feedback or send me an email if the BETA version doesn&#39;t work on your rooted Oreo device.

            "Great app! I use it to limit how much I zone out on Reddit, the little toast notifications keep me more mindful of my usage. I like how flexible the rules are, and that you can stack them for a single app (e.g., limiting both time and launches). The fact that you can pause rules as well is useful for me, because there are times when I want to have free access, and times that I don't (though you can also disable this feature if needed).",
            "Loving the app to help control my constant need to be entertained by Instagram Twitter Facebook at every moment I feel I deserve a break, which are far toooo many times in the day. Really like that it gives me options as to how I would like to control my usage... From blocking an app during certain hours of the days or how much time I spend on it etc. Very effective!",
            "OMG this app is superb.. It has easy to use as well as so good for removing addiction to an app for sometimes. Would have been better if there was a permanent lock would have been added for a certain time which doesn't allow pausing rules.",
            "Great concept, doesn't work on my device The idea is great especially the concept of having different types of detox, but on my Xiaomi phone none of the detox rules are enforced. It will sometimes give a very very small message and the bottom of the screen but nothing else",
            "I downloaded this app a few hours ago and so far I like how it functions from the little bit I've used it. However, this whole time its had a notification badge and notification icon at the top of my screen. I can't figure out what it's for when looking through the app, so I can't clear it. This alone is annoying enough to want to delete the app if it's not resolved."

A small software tweak should fix this, at which point I would change my rating from 3 Stars = Neutral, to 5 Stars = extremely happy with the program.",

It either works well on one platform and is a total disappointment on another. So far EPIM has worked very well for me. Though I do wish that tables would sync as they were intended to look instead of changing them to a list format. That might be an Android limitation, I am not sure. I'm no coder. Overall very pleased with the outcome.",

            "This is a great app to get advice. It has helped me alot.",
            "thanks for making a platform for people to support others. However, a few issues that i feel really needed 1. Privacy: chat history is saved at server which includes personal data (though it is annonymous). It should be on device only. 2. Bandwidth: It fetches data everytime from the server. server perspective, you'll be charged extra & bad UX due to slowness and high data use 3. Search: serach option in chat so that old info can be referred instead of asking to the user or scrolling all history",
            "Loved the idea and the intention behind the creation of the app. The execution of it kind of lacked though. Just like Twitter, this could be a breeding ground for people seeking cheap online sympathy highs. And at some level I believe the app already has. Users that are really seeking help could potentially be given an advice by a person who only cares about making others feel good because it makes them feel good, and does not genuinely care one bit about the other person's wellbeing.",
            "It's a good app. I like the concept however I believe people giving support should be above 20. There are people reaching out but having difficulty understanding situation of the person in trouble. This end up giving more unwanted pressure for the one needing help. Keep up the good work!",
            "Thank you for your response to my review. But your response does not make sense. You cant keep a person in a app. I unstalled the app as it did not appeal to me. And plus I cant afford to pay for the subscription in order to set up profiles etc."

One that I am directly referencing states something about critizim blocking the person from changing. Also, this app has not been updated in a long time because it keeps triggering a message on my phone saying that it was made for an older version of android and may not opperate correctly.",
            "So far a good app but I hope it'll be updated at some point, 5 years is a long time to go without any updates.",
            "I really like this app as it's been helping me keep myself accountable for my eating. it is rather personalisable, however I would very much like to be able to add \"emotions\" in the log meal section, and I also have to mention that my notifications have stopped working, which is honestly a shame because now I sometimes forget to use the app. except for these two points, the app is really great!",
            "I'm feeling the benefit of using this app after just one week. I am always enticed by the control of logging all of my calories in diet apps, but this just makes my disorder worse. Rise Up offers a very helpful solution where you can log your meals manually and with no expectations. I think this helps me feel accountable to myself. Just taking this small action gives me some hope for improving my situation. As well as this feature are many journalling tasks which I've found a good way to focus my mind on non ED patterns. The app does not have a polished feel yet, and the motivational pictures after I log a meal seem rather generic. These are the only slight negatives.",
            "Good app but some of the quotes are really unhealthy. 'you will not be punished for your anger you will be punished by your anger'. That's encouraging an unhealthy relationship with anger. Also the feedback email they give on the app doesn't work"

            "Just starting out with this but so far i think its great. It has all the things I've been looking for , for months in an app and after NUMEROUS free trials of various platforms. Though they were not bad services, they all seemed to lack one aspect or another that would require us to use a secondary program or software for what we need to do as a team. The goal was to have everything in ONE place. Simple, easy, effective. and I found it with LEADer it seems, plus BONUS that its free! We generate leads, track our progress with them, keept track of our customers, and our sales, and even helps with lead generation, all in one place. THIS is the app i have been looking for!!",
            "It would be perfect if it had a section inside the customer profile maybe below \"add notes\" for something like \"documents\" where I could upload a picture to the app. It seems like this would be a function that the app already has but I just havent found it?? I am a roofing contractor and it would be great to have a picture of the paper contract as well in the customer profile folder. This app is great however, it's just that one thing that would be nice to have.",
            "Really surprised to get so many invaluable features for FREE with LEADer's state of art one stop solution for all my CRM needs. Very interestingly can get in touch with leads, customers with my different SMS, Calls platforms availability that my life so much more easier. Really thank to this app developers. You have done an incredible job! Congrats!!!",
            "Just Starting out the Freelancer Journey; A CRM solution is just for such activities; This was simple to setup and go; Great going so far; Hope to have a nice journey together. Would love to have more features in future too, for the sales pipeline.",
            "As a small business owner and freelancer, I needed a tool that can simplify my lead generation. LEADer is a great app as far as customer relationship management (CRM) is concerned. This app makes it easy for small businesses to communicate with customers on the go. With this app, forget losing leads or sales opportunities as it will send a message to your customers after they have been with you on the call. Ops, even if they hit your voicail, they app will send a message. Keeping you in touch"

            "I had a few glitches with this app, notably when casting to the tv. I like the routines but was dissatisfied that some of the workout classes you couldn't save to use again - apologies if you can, I couldn't work out how! The other issue I had is that like most other apps there is a lot of squat exercises, not good for me, and an alternative is often tricky to find. Sad that so much is only available to subscribers, I haven't renewed for the above reasons, and I'm not interested in the meal plan",
            "I like the classes, but feel sad about not having them available on the weekends. The workouts are good too, but I am still trying to figure out how to create a routine for the week / month, that is complete and balanced. I found this app is not very good at providing that. The previous app I had was very good at setting up a 3 month program and I did not have to figure out what to do everyday, plus I felt I was working towards a more clear and oriented goal.",
            "Great app! Changed my life :) got addicted to online workouts.. Good diversity, awsome trainers, you can choose the workout level and type easily. Highly recommended!!",
            "I've tried alot of apps to help motivate and hold me accountable and 8fit is the only one that has worked for ME! I love that it starts your work outs at the level your at. It has alarms, recipes, and I can log my daily work outs to hold myself accountable. I use the free version right now but will upgrade when I reach my first weight loss goal!",
            "I enjoy this app. It's good for keeping my workouts on a schedule and helps me stay motivated. I can track not just the guided workouts I've done through the app, but also the workouts I do elsewhere. I'm not even using the premium version, either. I likely will get it, though! The classes it offers look good, and being able to access recipes would be great."

            "This is an interesting application of data that zones in on different personality types. The test categorized me as a INTJ and the accuracy of the test to me is about 95% correct. And I feel 5% INFJ. I feel in my youth INFJ was about a 50% fit and 50% INTJ. This app would seem to help with the decisions of making career choices as a suitable fit along with the understanding of your personality.",
            "The sliding scale Interface was a difficult to understand at first, but once I understood, that you were rating how close you were to one charasteristic vs. The other, answering went smoothly. I would give 5 stars, because a scale is more accurate than simply choosing one or the other for the pare of traits. HOWEVER, the English translation of the results is really wacky. It's not unintelligible, but there a lot of weird coinages, missing auxiliary verbs and indefinite articles, etc.",
            "Love the app, but I'm gonna be honest here. When I searched \"personality test\" I was really more just looking to find out what kind of bread I am. Still, I was very pleasantly suprised with this, as I believe the result to be very close to who I am as a person. 5/5",
            "Some questions seemed vague but the result was a very good analysis of me - at least how I perceive myself. Well worth doing as it explained some of the quirkier side of my personality. I would estimate it around 97% spot on which I would think is pretty darned good for a quick, one-off test.",
            "I really liked this! I feel like I got a lot of insight into myself; it's kind of fun reading descriptions that sounds like a narrator telling me who I am. -INFJ .. a lil bit of an INTJ? Yea ... okay 😌 I am weird, and PROUD"

Huzzah 10/6/20 I'm looking forward to a fix and reinstall! ORIGINAL REVIEW GG has been wonderful for years; it stopped saving and stopped being uploaded about 2 months ago. Too bad! I loved the garden, affirmation cards, and simplicity. It used to be so positive; now I'm just seeing lost gratitudes (the irony!)",
            "Beautiful way to be reminded to document every days blessings .... I have been using it for a couple of years and every so often you get a gratitude reminder from the past and then you are doubly grateful that day ....",
            "It's a great app because I am a very short tempered person and generally people don't like to connect with me. But, this app has definitely taught me to think about the good things that happen in life and to stay positive. Thank you so much...",
            "This is a nice app, but I would prefer reminders to record my gratitude instead of being told what I previously wrote months ago. Also, when I fill in my calendar retroactively, I don't get any points. Overall, I find the illustrations beautiful, but I can't see what I have added because it blends into the background.",
            "I love the simplicity of this app. Other gratitude apps I've tried have been too busy or new agey, and when I've started a gratitude journal in a physical notebook, I always lose track of it. This app is a great way for me to focus on the positive during a challenging period in my life. I like the inspirational cards: they are short and direct. I really like the analogy of the garden and the concept of gaining points to add to it. The only thing I would change is the visual design of the garden: if the base image was more muted, I would be able to see my garden filling with life more effectively. As it is I can't really tell how much stuff I have added. And I'd love to be able to add more animals and plants to more gardens someday. But that's a very minor quibble. Overall this app is fantastic and I highly recommend it."

My only gripe is that if I need to make entries or edits to multiple appointments or events, the app freezes after a few entries and I either have to wait for several minutes (even if I kill the app), or reboot to get the calendar back. I've learned to live with it, but would give 5 stars if this was fixed.",
            "This app has been mostly great, however in the last couple months the widget has stopped working. Sometimes I wake up in the morning, or check my calendar in the middle of the day and it says it's the previous day and none of the buttons will work. The only thing I can do is restart my phone. One plus 5. Edit: I am using stock launcher, and I have changed battery optimization to off we shall see if that fixes it. Thank you for the reply.",
            "Great app. The free version offers all the features I need and more, integration with google calendars is seemless and I rarely have issues with the app. I'm not a fan of the new ad format, but I admit it was short sighted of me to initially give a 3 star rating because of that. I am changing it now to 5 stars, because this is still by far the best calendar app I've used!",
            "Used it for a month or more, has all the extras I need. Agenda, tasks, events, all together and separate. I like you can push things forward on your calendar easily. You can set a time to complete a task so it tells you when its over due. So far so good, best one I have found."

Doesn't compketely replace the actosr face to resemble your face. Some of the clips seem like they do not change a bit. Is there a way to better the consistency of the refacing? If so, then I would give the app a 5 star rating. Thank you",

Had I paid for the full version, I could have been sleeping most of the night but I had to support the app by watching 30 second ads before each reface. 2. I get the ads but maybe not before each reface, maybe every other one. At least change the ads up a little. Most of the time you're watching the same ad like that's going to make me buy the product.

The bad part is once it syncs with your bank it might not do it again for hours or days; my CC and banks are always off sync. Has serious problems staying linked to credit cards. Now it supports less banks. The customer service denies issues and gives the most useless \"fixes\", like \"import it\" or \"enter by hand\".",

            "I use this app to keep up with my own time and to verify that my paychecks are correct. In one month, it's already helped me catch an error that would have cost me about $150 in lost wages. I would have given it 5 stars, but I wish it was more customizable to a 3rd shift schedule. My work week does start on Sunday, but my Sunday starts on Saturday night and it splits my wages, so i have to trick it by putting all the hours after midnight.",
            "I really like the app. Especially since it notifies me that I have to clock in clock out. You have to set it up though but I am glad it has that option I Hope to figure out how to do a different format on the timesheet part of it. But other than that it's a great app . And it be nice if it didn't quarter out where I'm at working if I'm there for a long period of time.",
            "This app is fantastic. I just made the switch to full-time freelancing and have multiple contracts with different companies. This app makes it super easy to keep track of my hours and separate my rates and pay for my different contracts. The best part is being able to create a detailed timesheet for invoices with the press of a button. I know this sounds super advertisement-y, but these are my actual thoughts. I ain't no sheep.",
            "It's almost perfect but there's one big problem. It doesn't have the option to select a pay period of bi-weekly. It has twice monthly but not bi-weekly which is unfortunate because it renders the app completely useless for people with schedules like that. Which happens to be the majority of the workforce of factory workers like me.",
            "Edit: It's working Edit(10/13/2020): App has become completely unresponsive, after trying to get me to rate the app, which I have done. It would not let me access anything other then the homepage which is no better then a picture of what I could be doing Currently at time of posting, the app has become extremely slow and glitches out so badly it will crash or nothing will happen till you go to close the app. Please fix because the app itself has been super useful for me to keep track of my pay"

The time of day is just as important as the date itself and a pretty standard question providers ask when asking patients about their symptoms. I have to keep a time and date log while wearing a heart monitor so they can correlate the two but I don't see how to do that. I will be requesting a refund.",
            "The app is quite good but you need to add more functions and more details, add stuff that would keep your customers motivated to use it. E.g if you use the app and enter data you have an animal that grows as you enter data every day. Once that animal grows you get another animal or plant or a garden or something that you'd care for while caring for yourself.",

            "Weird unintuitive interface, doesn't allow you to select more than 1 item e.g. when I add activity it deselect mood and it won't generate a list of items you've selected. Doesn't make any sense.",
            "after playing with the app a bit more I'm going to have to pause in my use. I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

My morning routine has changed from Wake up - Brush - coffee to Wake up - Brush - Omvana - coffee :) The experience is absolutely spectacular...I strongly recommend to download this wonderful app. Thank you Vishen :)",
            "Overall I enjoy this app. The content is great and the underlaying additional deep tones under the meditations are nice. Having said that: I am going to have to start taking stars away. Several bugs have become more and more noticable, prominent, and now: down right annoying. Meditations are consistently stopping mid way. Program utilized and or paid for are constantly disappearing from my library. The undertones also randomly stop. Really doesn't look good for a $70/yr app.",
            "Access to my favorite courses/files fails very often. Playback is stopping in the middle of meditations even if the app has no system restrictions to use power or whatever. The app is updated to the latest versions always. Some sound files are with disturbing backround noises ... like recorded in a office, kitchen or where ever. I would love to use this app but this renders the app useless.",
            "This app is so great, and thank god, there's lots of free learning, meditations of various lengths and complexity, and choice of wonderful collection of background ambient sounds, or silence. Thanks so much Vishen for making all of this available. I especially love the 6 Phase Meditation 💜🙏💜🦋",
            "Great app with so many different classes and meditations. Love that we can filter them. However, the circle makes it difficult to move back and or forth when it comes to lessons. Maybe having a button to press to go back 10 seconds?"

            "I have tested nearly every CRM out there and i HATE THEM for charging a monthly fee - what you only find out after you have registered with them. Clienti was the first app i found that i can use without the need of a registration, though there is such an option where you can pay 4 EUROS per month to backup your data, what i do not need and like but that is my own opinion.  One main reason why i do not wanted to register with the other big CRM players is the data - nobody knows that they do with the data that you enter and specially the amount of money and sensitive contact information. And they also lack, just like clienti a bit, in having no \"open\" import or export option. Thats obvious because they do not want you to move from one service to other and take your data with you.  Otherwise i love the ClientiApp, though these few things might be hopefully changed in the near future:  IMPORT FUNCTION To import your data you need to upload a CSV file to the clienti website. As i mentioned above, i want my data to be secure and kept with me.  MANUAL There is a \"Group\" option where you can create a group but i have not found out what this is good for.",
            "Perfect for what I need. I would give it 5 stars if there was a mileage tracker. Otherwise, it should be every subcontractor's go to app!",

            "Really useful customer database. Can run a small business with this CRM. Well done and keep up the good work.",
            "Absolutely wonderful app for my Dog Business. The Tags are great and make organizing my clients easy. Would definitely recommend and I'm definitely buying the Pro version!"

            "Still some recon issues but it's manageable now. If you're into characters collection and management then this one is perfect for you. This game will keep you playing all day. Very easy to play, but you'll have to read lots of stuff to fully grasp your companions' full abilities. Same with gears and items needed to rank them up. Love the events and updates. Please add an option to view the 'Books' in menu with 'Next' button. Also add the 'Lock/Unlock' button when long-pressing companions. Thanks",
            "Updated review. I really like this game but the developers have been making choices towards forcing players to buy things. Not in small quantities either. Hopefully speaking out makes them change some things. I'd happily change my review if they start doing things for their players instead of creating artificial paywalls to try to milk people.",
            "[NEW REVIEW] Developers have newly moved towards p2w models for endgame. Dont waste a year in f2p heaven only to realize you're hundreds of dollars behind the top50 and no amount of time will matter. MASSIVE ENDGAME PAYWALL. DONT BOTHER PICKING THIS UP. [MY OLD REVIEW] F2P Heaven. Barely any ads necessary, rly only 3x a day. Rewards loyalty by releasing limited items only once. Always makes that item truly available to F2P players.",
            "Good game. Not for totally beginner. Too much details right at the start and many things to consider made this game confusing. Although theres a fanmade walkthrough that can guide players in to the right direction but its much better if they add more inside the game.",
            "One of the most underrated games I have ever seen. The translations are hilariously bad, but you don't need them. The gameplay is rich, fulfilling, active and engaging. If you like build sims, management sims, hero collection games, deep systems and a ton of depth, give this game a week of your time, and find a new favorite."

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",
            "The UI experience is bad and not intuitive. I found it frustrating to use."

I looked at premium, will consider if the notifications seem helpful, but still 35 bucks for lifetime is steep, especially when I don't know if it's good yet, and feel like I won't enjoy it regardless due to the ads. Ugh I have no other app with this frequency of ads.",
            "Love the app functions, and find the count down feature works well to add a sense of urgency to future but approaching tasks/deadlines etc. Would be 5 star. But, habit tracker and the count part of the app crash the app when I open them. It didn't happen immediately and I tried a reset, delete cache etc in settings. I then gave in deleted reinstalled and sadly it's happened again a week into using the app. The tasks bit on its own is less unique. Please fix the crashed so I can use the app :)",
            "A very good app with simple material design look, quotes and stories are updated everytime lunching the app. My only request to the developer is to categorize the quotes and stories according to the topics and add search function. It would legit help us find what we want to read rather than reading unwanted stuff :)",
            "Damn! So useful, it used to be just a wallpaper and quotes app before but with the new update they have really amazed me, habit tracker is so handy! The motivation feed has awesome curated articels, no joke, i owe 1000 bucks to these guys, one of the article i read was so key to closing a client! Happy to support the developers $2.99 is nothing when you get a 500x the ROI, thanks for this app guys 🙏",

            "Great system, really handy for the whole family!!! It would make more sense though if you had to tap and hold the items to remove them from the list and just tap once to edit... So basically the other way around. Because the way it works now it happens to us quite often that we accidentally remove items from the list. But other than that, super happy with the app :)",
            "Okay so I've used it for the first time for shopping yesterday, and yeah random things did get added to my list. It was frustrating because it was items that we go through regularly and it made us doubt if we actually needed it or not. Also I wish the inspiration page was bigger. I wish there were 100s of recipes you could search for rather than there be the same 5 recipes on a list. Over all I love the idea of this app, but it needs some work. I'll keep using it for now.",
            "Great app and would normally give it five stars but recently the Wear OS app doesn't seem to be sending notifications? It's strange as I can get notifications from Bring! to my phone when the Wear OS app isn't installed but obviously can't view my list on my watch without the app. But when I install the Wear OS Bring! app on my watch the notifications no longer come through. Any ideas? Have made sure all relevant notification permissions are set up on both the Watch and Phone apps so I don't think the issue is there.",
            "Great app. We live far from town and sometimes one of us will head out to do the shopping. Anything I miss from our shopping list can be sent automatically from my wife's list and vice versa. This is how web based apps should all work.",
            "Amazing grocery/shopping list app.. why? 1) Share lists easily for others to add to 2) Google assistant integration for hands free operation 3) WearOS support 4) stores your loyalty cards in one place 5) clean and intuitive interface 6) responsive development team 7) always improving and incorporating user feedback."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Been a member on the plans for a long time. But the app is great when it works. However I am constantly having to log in and it doesn't stay logged in. Also the reminders rarely happen when they are scheduled. It is the latest and even when it says I should be getting reminders they don't actually come thru most of the time. But thanks for the input",
            "I love this app and use it all the time. Would love: 1) to be able to use it on my Chromebook. Having to choose between the tiny phone screen and our tv (which is in high demand) isn't ideal 2) to be able to save check-ins on the app itself. The sharing tool doesn't always work and then I have to either fast forward through the workout to get my picture back (which messes up my count for my badges) or I lose out on the check in.",
            "Love this app! So many workout styles, trainers, equipment, and durations! I'm a mom of two so it's great for quick, but effective workouts! Also love that it includes the nutrition plans! I can always easily find the recipe I'm looking for! I highly recommend for women looking to be challenged, uplifted, encouraged, and understood! 💗💕💗",
            "I remember when this app was busy and some features wouldn't work. But it looks like a lot work was put into it to improve it! Easily shareable, reminders to keep you accountable, and you can simply cast to your tv (If you have the corresponding device lol) It's awesome and motivating! I find myself always signing up for the new programs",
            "I was really disappointed that the programs are so cumbersome. You can't stream the workout on your computer which is how I normally follow workouts in that garage and I wasn't abe to cast them to my tv either. If you want to print material I would have to download on my phone email to myself to keep or print from my computer. I'm sorry I dont want to follow a workout on a phone"

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

            "Cannot book sessions. No customer support. My therapist was great, but haven't been able to book another session. This issue is not resolved!!!! Took customer support 13 days to get back to me and thier response did not help. I guess I have to wait another 13 days now...who knows? I'm so annoyed by this. I'm just going to cancel my membership - instead of Talkspace helping me with anything it's become another source of frustration in my life. Freakin' worthless.",
            "I submitted a question to customer support 11 days ago and have not gotten a response yet. I want to cancel my account, but there is no button to cancel or deactivate. This app is terrible. The texting feature is one of the major reasons I signed up for Talkspace, but I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth since my therapist does not respond for 8-12 hours. When she does respond, she just says she has some ideas that could help me, but that she will share them during our next session, making me wait several days for any sort of lifeline! I need help now! I'm paying for this service! On another similar therapy app, I was able to message back and forth with my therapist and get instant feedback. As for the video chats, I would have preferred if my therapist would have been stationed in one place the whole time instead of walking around her house. It was a bit unprofessional and even when she was sitting down because she had a tv on somewhere in the house and she was moving the camera all around making me sea sick. To make matters worse, I had no way of knowing if anyone at her house could hear our conversation! She had a lot of experience as a therapist, but admitted that she was new to Talkspace and had not yet read all of the handbook and all the rules she was supposed to follow as a provider. When we got booted out of our video call three times, she suggested that we FaceTime. Again, not professional! Talkspace is a secure platform where mental health information can be shared. FaceTime is not! I'm going back to the other app I was using before. It was slightly more expensive, but wayyyy better!",
            "Do not waste your time or money with this app. My therapist has been really wonderful and responsive, but the app is absolute trash. I reached out to support and the only response I received was, \"We've received your support request, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" That's it. No actual response to my concern. I can't book new sessions because I \"don't have any session credits available\" and there's no obvious/visible way for me to even pay to book another session. To top it off, the sessions that I have booked with my therapist have been such poor quality that I am literally talking to a blank screen because her face never shows up, despite us both having very fast internet connection speeds. I'm really disappointed in the general usability of the app, the complete lack of customer service, and the quality of the calls between me and my therapist.",
            "The issue has been resolved. Thank you! I was charged a total of 8 times in one month and still have not heard back from customer service or been issued a refund. On top of that, the app is still behaving as if i haven't renewed my subscription despite having taken 8 monthly charges out. If customer service ever reaches out and resolves the issue then I will change my rating because I love my therapist, but I dont like being multi-charged for a service I am not receiving.",
            "Received an invite link to this service. The first therapist told us they could not accommodate video sessions, which is what we paid for. The second therapist did not respond to any messages. Talkspace seems unable or unwilling to provide the service we paid for."

Also, entering numbers with scroll selectors is like threading a needle every time. WW has a option to tap on the number and type the data. If you could add this I'd be so appreciative! It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",
            "I've been having trouble with the app with the new upgrade. When I try to enter info on a new food or add a recipe, I get a blank screen. This is a pain and hope it fixed soon. I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",

            "The text is much too light to read! Too many steps to find a food. Should be more like the app lose it. But please, make the text darker."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",

So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "I've been using this for more than a year and I've had enough. The journal doesn't work and my completed challenges are not saved. I upgraded to premium, same thing. Sometimes the challenges themselves have nothing to do with the text example, which is almost entirely based in the work of one author, Carlos Castaneda, whose work is widely criticized as being a dishonest fantasy cloaked as academic fact.",
            "I was fooled by the high rating! In the morning, the app gives you what's supposed to be an inspirational quote with a challenge, such as \"stopping the internal dialogue\". That's it! It does not give you any hint about how to stop the internal dialog! I thought it would offer some methods for stopping the internal dialog, like meditation.",
            "this is probably my favorite application I've downloaded it's incredibly helpful and it's a great way to Everyday practice well-being and awareness of the self. highly recommend, I absolutely love it! the only criticism I have is that I hate that you have to pay for an upgrade which I'm not going to do which limits my ability to really get the full attributes of the app but other than that it's a really great daily self-help app I just wish you didn't have to pay for an upgrade which is stupid.",
            "just pure awesome. only one thing i would ask/suggest is to give me challenges with a hifher difficulty(im assuming i have to $upgrade$ to do so though... which is not good for promoting your app if you only have 2 feautures technically, the daily challenge and the journal) pretty basic but otherwise i love your app and it has definitely helped in my spiritual growth. thank you",
            "I love this app! Im very much enjoying the prompts, and the consistent use is shifting me into a mindset of using life as learning. However! I have one big complaint. I work nights, so the day centering around 6pm is very inconvenient. The challenge goes away at midnight, but my day doesnt end til 4am. I very frequently dont get to do my journal and wrap up for each lesson, which frustrates me."

            "I was able to successfully download and open the program on the Samsung Galaxy! It is nice to have this app back, not sure what the fix was but I am glad it was resolved. I had some communication with the Foundation this past year about this issue but I feel like the problem got sidelined a bit due the nature of 2020!",
            "Downloaded and installed this, even after looking at the only negative reviews. I created an account then went to log in and it just gives an error message. I tried using another email and register again, and made sure I was putting everything in correctly, it still gave me the error. Don't download, unless they update it and fix this and the other things that are said in other reviews.",
            "I'm not able to register for the app because having a lock screen is required. I don't want a lock screen precisely because I have epilepsy and want anyone to be able to access my phone in a time of emergency. Could you please fix this issue? I would love to use this app.",
            "I have been using this app since 2018 it is fine back then but as they keep on doing udates it gets on getting worst than better I recently tried to log the internet explorer cause I can't log on the the app... As I check on my seizure tracking of my diary 2018 was all there but for whole 2019 it was gone...",
            "This hasn't worked since the last update. And I kept all my sons seizure activity notes in great detail in this app. Now I cant get to it to give his doctor the information in a hurry. Please fix the problems with the app."
