            "I purchased the premium version only to find out it doesn't sync with my Samsung active 2 or samsung health It's a decent app to track your macros which I was doing fine in the free version. The app is confusing and requires a lot of extra input if you wanna use the premium features. The recipes are typically off on the macros. Also, there are often several options to choose an item to add, for ex \"egg\", and when you open it, it might be \"taco soup\". I regret purchasing the premium version.",
            "The app is simple and VERY helpful, especially if you are beginning your Keto journey like me. I love how the graphics help me monitor my progress. I've lost my first 5 lbs and I honestly feel this app has definitely supported me in doing this. I'm surprised I didn't quit using the app like I've done before with other apps. Give it a try. I'm SO GLAD I did :)",
            "This is absolutely a keto must have. I can't believe how good the food database is. I love that you can copy meals to multiple days and log your food diary for the week all in one shot on meal prep day! I noticed theres some kind of glitch scrolling through the values when you log a food. For example, when I indicate how many grams of avocado I'd like, sometimes the number value disappears if I scroll too fast and I need to go backward out of that food and back into it to make it work.",
            "This is the app you want to get if you are going to go on a keto diet. I liked it so much I bought the paid version. It has helped me lose 76 pounds and still losing weight. Would have given 5 stars but the app is painfully slow to load. To the Developers of this app. Please do something about how slow it is to load. I'll change my review if you can do this Cheers",
            "Love this tracker it is beyond easy and intuitive. Save recipes, copy anything to any day you want. Scan barcodes. Set up meal reminders and anything else you might need in a simple easy to read design. I \"WAS\" using 'my fitness pal' but seriously Carb Manager gives for free what MFP wanted me to pay $50 a year for.... CM is the best and I recommend it to everyone on keto or not because it's just that amazing to use & you DON'T need to pay!!"

            "I really like this app! It is probably the best app I've used so far, but there are two problems. 1. My totals keep disappearing from my dashboard. And it just shows zero for my macros. This usually happens after I enter my dinner. 2. I am having trouble entering some items. I tried making a recipe and wanted to add 1/2 cup of stevia. I couldn't change the measurements from tsp to cup. That is a bit annoying. I hope to figure it out.",
            "The tracker helps enormously: the ability to tweak menus in order to maximize protein, minimize carbs, and contain fats and calories is truly valuable. I have used Atkins occasionally over the years in order to catch a modest weight gain before it gets out of hand. In the past, it meant looking every mouthful up. With the tracker, I have so much more control and, indeed, motivation. This time, I'd gained ten pounds that I really didn't want! Using the tracker, six of them are gone. Yay!",
            "I love this app! It helps me get to my goals. Shows me if I need to eat more protein, or drink more water, etc. I can view my history and lots more on the dashboard. And best of all it is easy to use. Great job Atkins! PS so far I am down 15 lbs in 7 weeks.",
            "Tracking my carbs with this app helps keep me on track. So far, I've lost 19 pounds. I've gone from a size 8 to a size 2. 😁 Love it!! They also offer recipes to help you and the discussion board is very helpful. I would give it more stars if I could.",
            "I enjoy the recent improvement to track exercise beyond steps. Other ideas to get a well rounded caloric info should include sleep, working (standing vs sitting), meditation and other non cardio or resistance activities."

            "I've been using this app since July and have always loved it. However since the last update, I have to manually enter/ search for everything each time as the feature for remembering previous foods/drinks no longer works. It's a bit inconvenient since a lot of my things have to be scanned. Also, the different options for measuring (gram, cup, tablespoon, etc) is missing on lots of items which makes it hard to be accurate when you only have 1 option.",
            "Its great! I like that it has an extensive food list, I can keep track of all my measurements and see trend breakdowns. Love the recipes too! App functions better than others that I have tried. Nothing glitch-y or slow loading screen. Easy to use! The information entered is correct! I have used other apps, where when you put in the food item, it will have completely wrong carb information. Drove me nuts! The price is better also, some other apps want you to pay $10.00 a month or like $60 yearly.",
            "I have tried many apps while looking for a tracker. This has been the best one! I love the search on the database, it's concise and easy to locate items. Recent searches show up first. One of my favorite features is that you are able to select the measurement of food instead of converting from grams or guessing how many pork rinds are in 14 grams. It is really easy to customize the macros to suit your personal goals. You can also add foods by scanning a bar code. Great app! Money well spent.",
            "I've tried different keto apps, but this one is by far the best. Not only can I easily keep track of my calories, fats and carbs but the app helps me keep track of my water intake and moods as well. This is my favorite app for my keto lifestyle. I've tried keto several times in my life and have been semi successful. The only thing missing was this app. I feel that with this app, I'll be able to monitor my food intake better, monitor my carbs better and ensure better success for myself.",
            "Just started using this app the first of August 2020. But so far it's great! Easy to use. Just enter the foods you eat and the app tracks the macros and keeps up with your daily intake. 10/17/20 Just did an update. Do NOT like it. Can't find foods I've used for 2 months. The app randomly changes the macros on the exact same item. Multiple issues with the update.Had to go down to 3 stars. I want to go back to the old one I had."

            "This app ticks all the boxes for me for a weight tracking app (I've tried many). It has a decent barcode scanner and a reasonably well curated database, option to save meals and recipes, and a breakdown of macronutrients you consumed in the free subscription. It doesn't try to solve all the world's problems and do it poorly. That's impressively hard to find! I also like the UI, it's pretty, intuitive and uncluttered.",
            "Really love this app. I have used it for a month with no problems, but today I can't go to my goals without the app shutting down. Please fix this! Until today I would have given 5 stars. I've reported problem but haven't heard a response yet.",
            "Bugs fixed. I'd like to add that the year subscription is totally worth it. When paired with GoogleFit I have lost 25 lbs in three months. App holds you 100% accountable when no one else can, if you cheat you cheat yourself out of weight loss. Follow your plan , exceed your goals and the weight will fall off. By the time you realize it it is already a habit and you are accounting for everything u consume. The app will inform u of the areas that need improvement.",
            "Most nutritional information in this app is incorrect. For example, items like calories, carbohydrates and proteins are not always correct and in fact very can be far off. Where my actual carbohydrates are 180g, this app will tell me they are only 130g. This may have something to do with the fact that anyone can go in and adjust nutritional information. The app would be great otherwise but I cannot continue to use it or refer my clients because of the abundant false nutritional information.",
            "Two updates now and calories still do not change when weight changes. I have emailed support, but I guess the engineers just don't care that their app does not work properly. Not sure what their focus is within the app, but they sure are not good a fixing things they screw up thats for sure. I given up on emailing. Seems to be a huge waste of time."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

I will often enter everything I plan to eat *before* I eat it to make sure I don't inadvertently exceed my allotments, but sometimes don't finish it all. If there is a way to do this I haven't found it, but it could be user error. 🤷‍♀️"

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

It was easy to use and i like the total of calories, proteins, carbs at the top of the page. I will try it for a week and then decide to keep or find another food tracking app. A negative is I can't delete an item from me daily intake if added incorrectly.",
            "I like how it reminds you to track your food items as well as counts the protein, calories AND carbs. The only problem, not directly from the app, is that a person has the option to add n edit the nutrition facts, n sometimes people don't enter the correct info. Just be mindful of that.",
            "I love this app, especially compered to others. The main reason i consider this the best app, is because i feel it's honest with you and doesn't disturp you. Other apps have these annoying notifications, useless recomendations that really do not help you. This app feels clean and does it's job well. It doesn't have any annoying ads and it's extremely use-able. Searching up food is easy and scanning the barcode is even easier! It knows what product you are scanning 95% of the time.",
            "It works ok. Kinda wish it automatically saved all of your foods instead of just the ones you add yourself? A lot of items are entered incorrectly. It will often bring up a brand name food for store brand items. I like how you can customize your carb plan.",
            "I LOVE THIS APP 😍😍😍 It's easy, clear and quick. Trying to figure out a nutritious meal plan with Ulcerative Colitis and plant based lifestyle choices can be super frustrating and stressful so it's SUCH a relief to find something that works and is nicely designed. I want to hug whoever made it 🥰 thank you"

            "Very handy app. I use it everyday to track calories and nutrients. Would really, really like to see the option to use NET CARBS as the daily total carbs. That would be very useful to me. Love, love, love the bar-code scanning feature. I think some sort of organizational options for MY FOODS would also be helpful (folders? groups? sorting?) Scrolling through an unordered list of many items is pretty laborious. Overall, it's a very valuable tool to me.",
            "I started using this app on mid March and by mid October, I had lost a total of 13 pounds. It calculates the amount of calories you should consume based on your weight and height. It has a catalogue of foods and exercises with their calories, and it also allows you to add your own. You add the food you've eaten during the day and the exercise done. Certainly, it has been a useful tool during my weight loss efforts.",
            "Love this app! Tracks food, water intake, fitness and so much more. But my favorite feature is that you can scan most products and it will input for you. You can adjust amounts, if necessary. It has a community and other nice features. I am now asking myself why was I paying for a program (starts with a \"n\"). A youtuber (Kimberly Hooks) recommended it to me so now I am recommending it as well.",
            "I've used this app on and off, logging calories or just tracking food. I love it personally because the design is simple and aesthetically pleasing, adding your own foods and nutrition info is easy, and the bar code scanner is convenient for packaged foods.",
            "The only thing I would change is the ability to add foods not in the library with info that I have. Example Dreamfield Pastas I appreciate the correction. Found it, tried it, loved it. Really helping me. It was suggested by my doctor."

I haven't seen a lot of ads. If you don't want ads, change your settings or permissions.There is no prob with password reset. If you do have a prob with it, log in via the app first. If you're using the website, log in there with same password. Then sync if you'd like: option is in both the app & the website. It all works fine.",

            "Ads are pretty pervasive. There is usually an ad after every action. If I enter breakfast with 3 items, my action is delayed after each item. I would go to the premium but the option to purchase once yearly is not offered and must be debited monthly. (Not something I can do.) Thank you. I will try that. I did as suggested but the app will not let me enter foods, etc. It will not accept my goals entry. For two days I've gotten a msg asking me to connect. However, my phone is connected to the net",

The rate the app question is very premature. I read some of the complaints on here about this very same issue. thought it was trivial, but then it happened to me.

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

Food looks and tastes good again making my keto experience so much more bearable. Its an easy to use app(with pictures of how your meal should look like after prepping) and has all the nutrition facts too. Thanks for the awesome app, I like it.",

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

I can only change the amount I had by changing the units. That's much harder to calculate.) Idk, this is on the road to bring a great app. I would recommend letting the users have full control to customize it.",

Would be nice to have a ML/oz, gram etc calculator. Thanks for the app as is however its really great. Best to your team. Maybe as well be able to add in more separate meals for those that eat 6 or 7 meals a day. As well a time stamp of when the meal/snack whatever was logged in. Thx!",

            "Works great. Takes a bit of time to learn to navigate the app. Surprised at the number of vegan recipes available. Some food were incorrectly inputted so I sent a report and also updated what I have. I wish you could update the info yourself. Also, I wish there was more flexibility with the intermitten fasting time. Overall, happy and hopeful it will help me achieve my weight loss goal.",
            "I've been using this app for quite a few years and it is pretty decent. However, I was quite disappointed that the search option for one's own foods was removed; now one has to scroll endlessly until they find the food they are looking for. Furthermore, I would suggest adding a meal prep feature where one inputs the nutrition details for what one eats, but then the actual calories and stuff is only added to the daily counter once it has been eaten(a check off system).",
            "I really love how many options of food there are, I can always find the exact thing I've eaten on here and how much I had. The only thing I don't really like is the feature connecting the app with a step counter app like Google fit, it doesn't really seem to work properly and update my steps so I've started just adding them in manually. Aside from that it does all I need.",
            "When you search food it doesn't have as many options as I would like, such as restaurants. It might have one calorie count for something and the one below it is completely different. It's hard to know what's right or wrong. You can add them in but I don't want to do that every time so I feel like I am guessing. I wish it would have things set as peice or amount. It reminds you frequently to log info and encourages you which I like, and has a lot of meal options. The meal calorie count is nice.",
            "I'm using it to track my dietary supplements, it's pretty straight forward, and you can add your own foods (like your mom's recipe and stuff). I wish I could be more precise with the measurements (Adding Vitamin D in milligrams is pretty useless, for example) and that it accepted more nutrients (my supplement has a ton of vitamins and minerals, and it would be nice to track those. I wish I knew an app that could approximately the micronutrients content of my mom's recipe too...)"

Also the majority of calorie counting apps you need to either sign in with your email address or Facebook that's really dumb. ....I'm old school it's far easier to keep a food journal...thank you for keeping it simple",

However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",

The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions.

All in-putted values are added to a total so you can easily calculate your carbs value for a complete meal.\r\n\r\nThis app makes the process of calculating your mealtime carbohydrates much easier by eliminating some of the calculations that are necessary when carb counting. It also means that your carb value calculations will be more accurate which will improve your diabetes management.\r\n\r\nPlease note: This app is not a database of food types and their carbohydrate values. It gives you the ability to create your own database of foods with associated carb values and so requires you to research into what the carbohydrate value for a food item is and submit it to the app. Once it is submitted it allows for the carb value for portions of that food to be easily calculated. \r\n\r\nPlease also note this app is not a monitoring app that stores your carbohydrate intake, insulin use or blood sugar levels.",

All in-putted values are added to a total so you can easily calculate your carbs value for a complete meal.</p><br><br><p>This app makes the process of calculating your mealtime carbohydrates much easier by eliminating some of the calculations that are necessary when carb counting. It also means that your carb value calculations will be more accurate which will improve your diabetes management.</p><br><br><p><b>Please note:</b> This app is not a database of food types and their carbohydrate values. It gives you the ability to create your own database of foods with associated carb values and so requires you to research into what the carbohydrate value for a food item is and submit it to the app. Once it is submitted it allows for the carb value for portions of that food to be easily calculated. </p><br><br><p>Please also note this app is not a monitoring app that stores your carbohydrate intake, insulin use or blood sugar levels.</p>",

And also, would be nice to be able to export your data not only online but locally too, maybe in xls format or something. I am just cautious about losing data so keeping both would be the best option. I am also unable to edit anything I've added yet which is essential, I guess",
            "I've used this app for a while and loved it for my step son as he is type 1. But Today I opened the app and all the data I had added was gone. So started to add again but unable to export to save the data, so if I add everything again next time I update will all my data have vanished again? Such a pity as was great before.",
            "Great little app. I measure carbs by weight and also by quantity (depending on the product). Is it possible to save entries into the database by quantity as well? For example, Product Name [Rich Tea Biscuit], Quantity [2], Total carbs [10.5]. Thanks for reading.",
            "Would be OK but no joy with \"export\" function. App gives a file ref. of the saved file no path. I can't find the file anywhere on the device (using Solid Explorer) and the app itself doesn't find it so I can't re-import it! \"Pure\" Android 8.1.0 on Nexus 5x",

            "I didnt know why i couldnt gain weight since i am currently 20lbs under a healthy bmi. I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",
            "This app is easy to use and very accurate. But please make a weight GAIN version. People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to. But gaining weight is not only harder than losing it, it's also WAY harder to find help with it.",

Since have uninstalled something then there is a reason for it but if I don't remember it then I will be completely fair and even kind with a 4. Ratings matter, so does not keeping it. It obviously is not five stars or I would still have it on my phone. I think too many people rate things in haste I try not to do that.",

            "I've tried other calorie counting apps before but it never really worked for me. Then i just stumbled upon this app and somehow it just does it. It's just so easy to use, yet very comprehensive, very user friendly. I've used it for 6 weeks now and look lo and behold, I'v lost 6 pounds! And it doesn't even feel like an effort. The app has also really helped me switch to a ketogenic diet, and being able to track the percentages of carbs, fat and proteins i eat has been really instrumental in this.",
            "I usually don't do ratings, but I've been using Poundaweek for over a year & it works well. I like how you can create your own meals, & the free app is quite customizable. Plus the ads are MUCH less intrusive than other apps. Would like it to have a larger list of branded items.",
            "This app is simple and colourful. It sets a 1 week target for you and displays your progress in a bar chart. I prefer this to the My Fitness Pal app which relied on me making my own fitness plan and constantly reminded me to enter my meals. Poundaweek has made me realise that if I have a \"bad\" day or don't lose weight one week, I haven't failed. Only 4 stars because I'd like more UK foods to be in its catalogue. I'd also like a holiday feature so you could skip days during Xmas etc.",
            "I love this app even though I hate the thought of counting calories. It helped me lose 66 pounds and stay normal bmi for 2 years. Time to restart again after weight gain from the lockdowns. I don't understand the calculation of fat vs. protein percentage since I am eating more grams of protein than fat and the percentage of protein is reported as lower instead of higher. I wish someone would review the programming for the calculation...otherwise, love the app!",
            "I found it really easy to add food. I find it annoying to change color features i have to buy the app. So I don't bother with any of the extras. I dont like its auto adjusting my food calories. Lame."

            "I am surprised to note that there is an app that has been developed as if it were to be used in stone age. I recently changed my mobile device and hence got logged out of healthifyme.When i logged in again i lost all my data. I raised concern and was told that once i logout all my data will be lost!!!!!!. Grow up developers!!! There are n number of time i might have to logout. You want me to start from scratch everytime? I have lost data from March 2018 to October 2020. Will uninstall the app.",
            "I really like this app, especially if you subscribe, it will give you meal plan & you can adjust to your preference. However, at some point I find it difficult to tract everything in a single day. time consuming. Careful when you purchase the 1 month subscription, it will auto renew, so always remember to go to google play to cancel subscription to avoid money deduct automatically from your account.",
            "I had a really bad experience with this app. I had taken monthly membership of live studio. My membership got deactivated after 10 days for some reason. I had almost 10 classes left for the month. I reached to customer care. They just gave some copy paste reply and didn't resolve the problem. I waited for 3 days and then accepted that I lost my money for such a useless service. Don't waste money here there are better apps available.",
            "I don't know what actually happened with this app... Previously it was working good but after recent update, sometimes it doesn't count calories.. example if I'm walking and at 2000 steps if it's showing 200calories burnt so even after walking 5000 steps it'll show the same 200 calories burnt. I tried refreshing it, restarting app, even my phone.. but it doesn't work.",
            "I really liked the studio session but I personally felt that the smart plan is not at all useful and it's a waste of money. However the studio session is really really good. The coaches are very interactive, correct the posture immediately and give good motivation to push ourself"

It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",

I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",

You will naturally eat less and the number of calories eaten will drop.\r\n\r\nKeto Diet App Highlights\r\n\r\nKeto Recipes\r\n• Detailed and accurate nutritional facts\r\n• Optional ingredients offer more flexibility\r\n• Serving size adjustment\r\n• Favorite recipes to quickly find them\r\nNote: A KetoDiet Premium subscription is required to access all recipes.\r\n\r\nProfile\r\n• Set you carbohydrate limit and goals\r\n• Built-in Keto calculator to determine your ideal macronutrient intake\r\n• Update your weight, body fat & measurements to track your progress\r\n• Sign up for a Keto Diet account to sync across multiple devices\r\n\r\nPlanner & Tracker\r\nPlan your keto meals with our intuitive diet planner.

You will enter ketosis and start using fat and ketone bodies as energy source. One of the main benefits of ketosis is its ability to suppress appetite. While your ketone levels will increase, your blood glucose levels and insulin levels will drop, leading to satiety. You will naturally eat less and the number of calories eaten will drop.<br><br><u>Keto Diet App Highlights</u><br><br><b>Keto Recipes</b><br>• Detailed and accurate nutritional facts<br>• Optional ingredients offer more flexibility<br>• Serving size adjustment<br>• Favorite recipes to quickly find them<br>Note: A KetoDiet Premium subscription is required to access all recipes.<br><br><b>Profile</b><br>• Set you carbohydrate limit and goals<br>• Built-in Keto calculator to determine your ideal macronutrient intake<br>• Update your weight, body fat &amp; measurements to track your progress<br>• Sign up for a Keto Diet account to sync across multiple devices<br><br><b>Planner &amp; Tracker</b><br>Plan your keto meals with our intuitive diet planner.

I use it daily to log in my food and sometimes I cook recipes from it. So far I lost 8 pounds and it didn't even feel like dieting.",

            "Before I found this app I was stuck at 178 lbs… for months. I don't know if it's thanks to the macros (which recommended a bit more protein than other apps), the electrolyte tracking (I started supplementing magnesium) or the recipes (which are really tasty by the way) but it helped me get the scales moving again. Whatever it is it worked!",

I’ve planned out my whole week and the keto friendly groceries I need to pick up at the grocery store! The recipes look amazing, but I haven’t made any yet. Hopefully they live up to expectations",

This app is primarily for Type 1 diabetics. It displays the carbohydrates for the amount you want to consume at a meal or snack time. The nutrients button shows other nutrients besides carbohydrates, including calories and total fat.\r\n\r\n• Reads the barcode on a food package and then automatically searches for the barcoded food item.\r\n• Uses a local USDA Nutrition database with over 8,700 food items.\r\n• Uses the internet to search the USDA Food Data Central database with over 341,500 food items updated continuously.\r\n• Can work offline using the local databases. Internet access for USDA database can be turned off.\r\n• Search directly from the opening page using words or the upc code from a food item.\r\n• Searches are fast, usually less than a second.\r\n• Nutrition values are now in the new USDA nutrition label format.\r\n• Display the brand owner, upc, or gtin code by setting check boxes in the settings.\r\n• Email your user database or a single food item to anyone and then download the database to their phone or yours.\r\n• Basic use is on one page. Other less used pages are nutrients, settings, and help.\r\n• Help page has an index to help find topics and can be set as a half page help on main screen.\r\n• Portrait display only so display does not rotate when you lay it down.\r\n• Fast searches with words in any order.\r\n• Saves your searches for easy reuse.\r\n• Use English or metric units or both in meals and recipes.\r\n• You can use weight or volume units for most food items.\r\n• You can use fractions or decimals.\r\n• Has a numeric calculator and conversion calculator that can use fractions as well as decimals. \r\n• Enter a single food item, meal or recipe.\r\n• Save your food item, meal or recipe to a local database.\r\n• Shows these nutrients on the Nutrients page: Calories, Total fat, Saturated fat, Polyunsaturated fat, Monounsaturated fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Total Carbohydrates, Dietary Fiber, Total Sugar, and Protein.\r\n• Requires permissions to save files locally and use the camera.\r\n\r\nIf you have a food item that is not in the USDA database, you can enter your own and save it to the user database. The minimum required data is serving size, carbohydrates per serving, and the amount you want. You can enter other nutrients as well on the Nutrients page.\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple items for a meal, or have a recipe, you can enter the ingredients to get the total carbohydrates. Save this to the user database with any name. The recipe ingredients are shown at the bottom of the screen and saved with the item you save.\r\n\r\nMost items in the USDA database have weight and volume units as well as descriptions that are not units. A good example is Apples, raw, fuji, with skin which has two descriptions, 1 cup sliced and 1 large. If you select 1 cup sliced, the units will be cup so you can use a measuring cup, tablespoons, liters, etc. If you select 1 large, the units will be large. You could select 2 large for two apples or 1/2 large for half an apple.\r\n\r\nFor food items not in the databases, you will have to search the manufacturers web site or get it from a nutrition label. If you expect to use this food item again, save the food item to the user database. \r\n\r\nA cooking database was extracted from the USDA database and put at the beginning of the search so that if you search for salt, you will find Salt, table near the top of the screen in the Cooking Database.\r\n\r\nThere is a miscellaneous database that includes food items and recipes that we have entered for our granddaughter. It does not have all the nutrients or show the recipe for all items.",

Internet access for USDA database can be turned off.<br>• Search directly from the opening page using words or the upc code from a food item.<br>• Searches are fast, usually less than a second.<br>• Nutrition values are now in the new USDA nutrition label format.<br>• Display the brand owner, upc, or gtin code by setting check boxes in the settings.<br>• Email your user database or a single food item to anyone and then download the database to their phone or yours.<br>• Basic use is on one page. Other less used pages are nutrients, settings, and help.<br>• Help page has an index to help find topics and can be set as a half page help on main screen.<br>• Portrait display only so display does not rotate when you lay it down.<br>• Fast searches with words in any order.<br>• Saves your searches for easy reuse.<br>• Use English or metric units or both in meals and recipes.<br>• You can use weight or volume units for most food items.<br>• You can use fractions or decimals.<br>• Has a numeric calculator and conversion calculator that can use fractions as well as decimals. <br>• Enter a single food item, meal or recipe.<br>• Save your food item, meal or recipe to a local database.<br>• Shows these nutrients on the Nutrients page: Calories, Total fat, Saturated fat, Polyunsaturated fat, Monounsaturated fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Total Carbohydrates, Dietary Fiber, Total Sugar, and Protein.<br>• Requires permissions to save files locally and use the camera.<br><br>If you have a food item that is not in the USDA database, you can enter your own and save it to the user database. The minimum required data is serving size, carbohydrates per serving, and the amount you want. You can enter other nutrients as well on the Nutrients page.<br><br>If you have multiple items for a meal, or have a recipe, you can enter the ingredients to get the total carbohydrates. Save this to the user database with any name. The recipe ingredients are shown at the bottom of the screen and saved with the item you save.<br><br>Most items in the USDA database have weight and volume units as well as descriptions that are not units. A good example is <i>Apples, raw, fuji, with skin</i> which has two descriptions, <i>1 cup sliced</i> and <i>1 large</i>. If you select <i>1 cup sliced</i>, the units will be cup so you can use a measuring cup, tablespoons, liters, etc. If you select <i>1 large</i>, the units will be <i>large</i>. You could select <i>2 large</i> for two apples or <i>1/2 large</i> for half an apple.<br><br>For food items not in the databases, you will have to search the manufacturers web site or get it from a nutrition label. If you expect to use this food item again, save the food item to the user database. <br><br>A cooking database was extracted from the USDA database and put at the beginning of the search so that if you search for <i>salt</i>, you will find <i>Salt, table</i> near the top of the screen in the Cooking Database.<br><br>There is a miscellaneous database that includes food items and recipes that we have entered for our granddaughter. It does not have all the nutrients or show the recipe for all items.",

            "Love the idea of taking pics for food diary! It's great whether you're visually tracking or following specific macronutrients. Something I might like differently is having the actual # I set for macros listed on the graph for the day as it does not show that now (just bars that never end?) I would also like the #s instead of the percentages on the home page, but that's just a personal preference. Otherwise this app has been great for tracking food intake and my weight for a bikini competition!",
            "Its a really good app, but i feel like the whole point of this app was to make it easier for you to log meals. Taking a picture of your meal and the app figuring out what your meal consists of is what is suppose to set this app apart from other apps like it. So that could use a little work, but overall it's the best meal logging app i have came across so far.",
            "Really good and usable with just enough features, but there are a few issues. The biggest thing for me is that it doesn't have a large database of prepackaged or fast food. This is a major advantage to competing apps. The second main issue is that the UX is a bit confusing. After adding one meal it's not clear what you're supposed to do at first.",
            "Pretty happy with it so far. It's a lot easier than any other food tracking app I've tried, and it's the first time I feel like I can stick to it! There are some usability things that I think could use some work though (there's no inertia scrolling on some screens, and sometimes navigating is a little unintuitive). Thanks for the great app! :)",
            "Best food tracker app in the whole Pkaystore! I enjoy the app because it is simple to use. Recording of the food can be done by having the app take a picture or putting in the name of the food. The amount of food eaten is easily adjusted by a on screen slide chart. All of the information is in a easy to see size. Yes, it is totally free! Nutritional information is provided and it is easily tailored to what you want to see. Carbs, protein and fat count is nicely displayed as well."

I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "The app, and the content inside, is brilliant. I just have a few little quibbles with it. Because I use it so often, it is annoying to have to sign in each time - it would be great to have an automatic/remember me option available. Also more exercises available to use and more food choices instead of me having to put info in that is not quite as accurate. Apart from that it is bloody awesome 👌",
            "I have been using this app since lockdown started and am a big fan and convert to this diet. I've found the remote support really useful during lockdown. I've mainly had to shield with my husband at home and have been joining the morning stretch classes too. I've lost 12kg since I joined. Thank you Katie, Michaela and Molly for your support ☺️ I use the recipes part of the app the most and my family like the Indian recipes too. Its worth the money but you will need some more for new clothes 😀",
            "Lots of blue spinning wheels where content is supposed to be. Video content doesn't seem to work, or just plays the first second or so and then stops. For the money I expect a lot better.",
            "Not only the app is easy to get the grasp, it also hosts a great deal of personalised resources, including daily meal plans tailored to your health and dietary preferences",
            "Not only a great educational tool on low-carb dieting, the app is also a good source of motivation for you to strive towards improving your health in general"

            "I believe this app has potential, though I suggest adding several things: * switching between imperial and metric units. This will make using the app a lot easier for people outside the US. * Adding an option to implement the replacements into the actual diet, so that the shopping list adjusts itself. * Being able to see the shopping list for multiple days ahead. I doubt that anyone feels like going to the grocery store every day",
            "It's a great experience especially because it tells you what to eat in order to get what results. And the stuff required is neither complicated or expensive now what sets this apart from others is the fact that I can even track my progress💃",
            "Pretty good starter for a healthy diet habit. Effective weight loss for the first few weeks, probably shouldn't be continued for a long period of time. Simple and easy to implement. Diet effectiveness depends on body type so it would be wise not to take the numbers in the app seriously, such as 10lbs weight loss per week.",
            "After 6 days I lost 6 pounds so you may need to do it twice if you didn't lose weight in the first 3 days which is fine BECUASE 6 pounds in less than a week is alot! And I didn't even go exactly according to the diet coz on day 3,4,5 I ate snacks. And on day 2 I eat spaghetti with sausage for lunch 😅 but I exciesed each day and bruned 500 calories for 6 days and I lost weight in the end :) oh and if u really want it to work don't eat dinner on the 6th day eat like little snacks on 3 or 4 pm.",
            "It's what I expected and I like that they provide grocery lists. The app definitely helps keep you on track during the three days."

            "If anyone has ever tried the Keto diet, it can be incredibly tough. Finding foods that are low and carbs and taste good was very difficult. I was so close to just stopping the diet because I literally hated almost everything I was eating. Then, it clicked, I bet someone out there had these same thoughts. After looking around I finally found this cookbook. My goodness, this one is a life saver. It has a plethora of different recipes that use SIMPLE ingredients.",
            "Love love love this app. Best one I've come across so far. Every recipe is so easy to follow and that says a lot because I never step foot in the kitchen.. until I started Keto. This app gave me motivation to stick with it. This app has made cooking fun!! AND EASY!",
            "With this app I will have the capacity to cook genuine nourishment amid occupied occasions as opposed to being enticed to get pre-bundled or remove sustenances. I have seen numerous keto apps with such huge numbers of extraordinary fixings that most home cooks don't have. There is nothing more baffling than purchasing heaps of flavors that may be utilized for a solitary formula that I may never make again. The app is extremely efficient and it's extremely simple to discover what you need to cook"

It's super easy to log items in and even the scanner is quick and painless. Warning though, it makes a loud beep sound when the scan is complete but my phone is usually on silence.",
            "Really great at minus one major flaw. When creating your own recipe there isn't an option to scan the barcode of the food you are entering. Because of this I don't think when the macros are accurate when creating your own recipe.",
            "This is actually a pretty good tracker. I've tried a few and this one is more simple and easier. I am pleased at how straight forward adding info is. Set your daily calorie needs (ex:1200-1300 for me), add your foods consumed in the search bar by name of food or brand and tweek amounts if needed to get calories consumed. Then add what ever activity or exercise you've done to approximate calories burned and it gives you a daily journal. I like it. There arent any ads. That's a plus! 👍",
            "This is the best app I've ever used so far! I have searched for this type of app for a long time and i was always disapointed. The nutritional facts are acurate, you can track your progress and calories realy easy, make recipes, check your calories loss during workout... this app is truly amazing for me!"

The main difference between a regular low carb diet plan and a keto diet plan is the amount of carbohydrates and proteins allowed on a daily basis.

Most people start a ketogenic diet because they want to lose weight fast and consistently. However, scientific research suggests that ketosis goes further than that, such as lowering your blood pressure, risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, improving skin conditions and dental health, mood stabilization, and increasing energy levels.\r\n\r\nMyKeto = A Keto Diet Guide, Keto Macro Calculator & Low Carb Diet Tracker :\r\nTable of Contents:\r\n-Basics: Zero to Low-Carb, High Fat, Moderate to High Protein – Dropping into Ketosis.\r\n-Benefits: Backed by scientific studies, not by fad homeopathic guru practitioners.\r\n-Side-Effects: Yes, a low carb keto diet is not completely awesome.\r\n-Debunk Myths: Large amounts of fat, especially saturated fat, can’t be healthy, right?

Its been seamless in tracking what I eat and as I'm more of a visual person, it's made it way easier for me to distinguish amounts and other things. If you're looking to calorie count, this is the best app for it by a mile 👌",
            "Easy to use. Flexible views. Lots of food choices. A variety of diet types allow flexible target selection. Good tracking. Like it. Pretty sure I'll buy the product. Only issue was adding weigh in. The tool switched my start day on weigh in even though I put in the actual day.",
            "Love it! Its easy to use, follow and the data base massive! Set and track goals and even allow those extra days where you need the release of eating a little junk food! I've used a few apps like this, but this is by far the best. It really is worth the subscription! Thanks 👍",
            "I've never counted a calorie in my life. I always found it difficult (I'm not good with math) however this app is amazing, it doesn't feel like calorie counting. I was so impressed I brought the full package after just a couple of days.",
            "I like it.... Struggling to loose weight now tho unless I stick to goal calories minus the added for exercise. Good app. For the money esp. Compared to one's like noom, this is much easier to use."

            "I had purchased the pro version of this app - which for some reason is now discontinued. I am now being asked to pay a onetime amount for a repeated pro subscription by the developers. Have reached out to them multiple times over email and have received only one automated response in return. Taking money for the pro version then pulling the application out -- that's a proper scam. There is no guarantee that, if one pays for the pro subscription now, these developers won't ring in the same scam again. Uninstall. Move on.",
            "I have purchased the pro version which I prefer over the free one. This isn't a bad app at all but there is certainly loads of room for improvement. Some suggestions: Add a barcode scanner, healthy alternative options, recipes, grocery lists, conversions and being able to connect to different exercise devices or: Fitbit, Garmin, Google fit etc. My rating will definitely change to 5 star with some or all of these options included.",
            "I've used this app before, paid for the basics. Now that is gone, when I look for foods most are gone now. It's like you deleted your food library. Uninstalling it and looking for a new app. No longer works for me.",

Super easy and simple as well as personally effective to see what helps me to track what i eat. For someone like me who has ibs it is great to log what u have eaten that day and symptoms as well as weight loss planning :)",
            "I had the Pro version of this a while ago, and it worked wonderfully. Now, I didn't mind needing to pay for Pro again with the new app, but I'm pretty upset that I can't even access the features I paid for... I still get ads, can't access my weight chart. What's the point of having spent the money at all?"

            "I love this great app. The best app to creat cuatom recipes. It's super easy to use and has a great user interface. The database supports a lot of food and gets bigger and bigger. Personally, I am a friend of having a simple and therefore a more reduced selection compared to a database where you need to much time to find the right food. The only thing what I am missing is a bar code scanner or similar which can create my custom food and auromatically fill in my macro nutrition.",
            "I like this app and has been easy for me to use. I also have the ability to create my own meals since most of my meals I make it home, it is hard to find an app that has exactly what I need. Whereas this app I can actually build the foods and then save them as my custom foods. This app is also great for tracking exercising and water intake.",
            "Simple to use, the interface is beautiful - love the wave function and the colour options. Calories burned from exercise are recorded separately from calories ingested (in other apps the burned calories are deducted from ingested calories, making it difficult to know how many calories one has eaten overall). My only quibble is that on inputting food, the search functionality sometimes brings up random food items instead of the one you actually clicked on, accidentally inputting the wrong food.",
            "I have only had this app installed for one day so I can't speak to the long term, but so far so good. I particularly like how you can create your own custom food/meal list which makes it quick and easy for meals I make and eat on a regular basis.",
            "Currently using this app and it's very simple to use and not too many ads. It also records exercise and water intake. The only suggestion i can give is that pls allow us to search for the food from a search bar or something."

            "This app put a spotlight on my low energy problem, highlighting how low my daily fat and omega 3 intake was. Really surprised me, but it was spot on. I feel incredible now, workouts feel better, can challenge myself now in a really good way. The app has a lot of intuitive features that keep pushing me (almost unconsciously) to good, nutrient dense foods to meet those targets. Love it.",
            "This is such a cool app for tracking nutrition intake! I was surprised to learn my calcium and magnesium intakes were consistently low. Made it easy to correct a deficit I would never have dreamed I had. Reports are easily customized. U-tube how-to's & free webinars make it easy to learn. Gold membership is a great value.",
            "Easy fix and it's be 5! It took me 3 tried to find out why it said \"invalid data\" when I wanted to create a meal. Turns out your app doesn't allow the emoticons. I was trying to use the turkey. I like colors and images so something like that is more pleasing for me. Makes keeping track \"fun\". My planner has different colors and stickers just for support. I look at a crazy week and can smile. I'm weird. Love your app tho!!",
            "I'm finding this app so useful for tracking nutrition. I have had to go on a low carbohydrate diet and I can see at a glance the net carbs and proportions of other macros to make sure I'm on track. I also love that I can check all the vitamins and minerals as well as the foods that will supply them if any are low. Excellent 🙂",
            "Counts calories and shows key nutrients! I love how you can add your own foods and there are many preavailable to save you time. And being able to see your key nutrient daily values met is wonderful. Only thing to tweak is being able to see all your minerals you've gotten from what you ate. You can only see all the mineral percentages % from individual foods eaten. But wonderful to track calories and nutrients overall!"

Makes me very suspicious of what the app is doing. 2) first run experience is not good. For some reason it didn't record my answers the first time and after I made an account, asked me the same questions AGAIN. frustrating. 3) why is image recognition and bar code scanning seperate functions??? Other apps combine them, as you might expect. Poor ux.",

I chose \"Sedentary.\" It immediately proceeded to tell me that my \"calories goal\" to \"reach my target weight\" (WHAT TARGET WEIGHT? It never asked me about my target or current weight!) is 2378 kcal!! I'm 160 cm tall (5'3\") and weight 50kg (110 lbs).

That's a basic function that pretty much all competitors offer. Don't shoot yourself in the leg by being greedy. You won't convert users going premium for basics - right from the beginning with the first steps they're taking with your app, but only frustrate them, causing uninstalls"

Because carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced, the body is forced to burn fats for energy which helps in weight loss. Most people are generally addicted to carbohydrates and sugars, and Keto diet will help to get rid of this addiction.\r\nThe term “Ketogenic” refers to the act of the body turning fat stored in the liver to “ketones” which are then transported to the brain and supply it with energy. The reduction of carbs puts your body into a metabolical state called Ketosis. This is when your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy and supplying your brain with ketones. \r\nSome studies find that Keto diet is helpful for people with diabetes, and epilepsy.  \r\n\r\n💪 With Keto diet, you can:\r\nLose weight\r\nReduce the amount of blood sugar \r\nDecrease the intake of unhealthy high carb foods\r\nEliminate habits of eating unhealthy sweets and other high-carb meals\r\n\r\nDownload free Keto Diet App and start losing weight with low-carb recipes!",

Because carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced, the body is forced to burn fats for energy which helps in weight loss. Most people are generally addicted to carbohydrates and sugars, and Keto diet will help to get rid of this addiction.<br>The term “Ketogenic” refers to the act of the body turning fat stored in the liver to “ketones” which are then transported to the brain and supply it with energy. The reduction of carbs puts your body into a metabolical state called Ketosis. This is when your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy and supplying your brain with ketones. <br>Some studies find that Keto diet is helpful for people with diabetes, and epilepsy.  <br><br>💪 <b>With Keto diet, you can:</b><br>Lose weight<br>Reduce the amount of blood sugar <br>Decrease the intake of unhealthy high carb foods<br>Eliminate habits of eating unhealthy sweets and other high-carb meals<br><br>Download free Keto Diet App and start losing weight with low-carb recipes!",

            "I paid $19.99 and am extremely unsatisfied. I have already canceled and wasted $19.99. The only thing it allows you to do is log your food, water, and counts your steps. My Fitness Pal does all of this for free! Better Me literally sets you up with a plan, after you pay them initial money, you have to continue to pay them more money to get more access to the plan. I feel like I have been scammed.",
            "It is great app when you pay those $20. You get the meal plan on email, you get access to how to prepare many meals, etc. But, when I was asked to pay for diet plan there wasn't any info that it is a limited time subscription. Additionaly, after subscription ended I lost access to the app - totaly. Only screen I can see is the one that offers me different subscription options. So, you basicaly pay for email document with a diet plan and limited time to use the app.",
            "Good concept, but needs work. I like the hydration reminders, nice workout selection with subscription, but the tracking is severely limited. Food defaults to the same portion for every serving size (3.57oz) with no standards for basic items (like an egg) and you can't go back and add things the next day. Can't adjust fasting start time if you forget. Training suggestions pop up super late at night (like, 9pm) with no alternate timing options. Weekly reports don't include all tracked items.",
            "Doesn't provide the custom meal plan that it suggests from the personal preference questionnaire. There is only screen viewing. PDF access would be better for meal prep & exercise at the gym. I leave my phone in my locker so I don't loose it on the gym floor. This app is a bonufide gimmick. This type of plan can be found free in many versions on the internet. Subscription CANCELATION is proving to be a nightmare. I signed up 9 days ago & have been trying to cancel the renewal for 4days. Helping!",
            "So far so good. Glad not experiencing any real challenge with the app other than it freezing up or buffering during the workout. Will update as I experience more. Update - App did not live up to my expectations. Food diary list of options extremely limited. The plan started me out fasting, Wich is no big deal. However, it says I will be notified when to end the fast 16 hrs later no notice, 20 hrs later still no notice to end fasting. The workout/exercise plan did not record my activity."

Uses oz/ lbs ( non metric) so lost if using in Australia etc..Typos in recipe headers also shows this app was rushed. \" sparagus\"? etc..\" HOME\" menu option doesn't seem to work? Needs revision. Nice try.",
            "Android users were the last to have the diet doctor keto recipes app. As much as I like the idea that I can now access recipes. I find the app to be a bit boring. It's not very planned due to the fact that it doesn't have any meal plan access, nor can one see any nutrients facts. Hopefully there'll be more to this app. Thanks for your understanding.",
            "Good and easy recipes. I am giving only 2* because: there's no way to SAVE your recipes and there's no way to SHARE them. Also takes long open and asks for 5 stars. Please fix it and you'll get 5*. The app has great potential but now is somewhat annoying to use! I'm happy to pay for ads-free version with regular features like saving and sharing.",
            "This app has been great so far! It's simple, relatively user friendly, and there are lots of recipes to choose from. There are, however, a couple of suggestions I'd like to make. Firstly, it would be nice to have the option to save recipes for later. Secondly, it would be useful if the recipes could be ordered by level of difficulty."

            "This is my favorite calorie counter. It has a dark interface, a calculator, and doesn't look up recipes to tell you how much calories is in them when you just don't need that feature. most people like being able to click on old and trees they already made when it comes up and search but I hate that feature and that's the one gripe I have about this as a perfectionist. I don't have the same calorie mounts with every meal and I hate seeing that list come up.",
            "love it. this is extremely simple. Previously, I had just been writing down calories on a piece of paper and then adding them up and then making a weekly and monthly average. This app does that for you in the very easiest way. It may not be perfect for everyone because there's not a lot to it but it is perfect for me and I am just thrilled that it exists. But man it doesn't do much! This isn't going to give you a whole lot of help with your food. it's essentially an organized calculator.",
            "Awesome app. No bs. Just calorie count. No freaking searching for 30mins under e to find an egg. We have Google for that. Just put your calories in.",
            "Elegantly simple. Perfect. Thanks for maintaining this. QUESTION:  re data backup. The file location on the phone does not get backed up with other App data with Google auto backup. My phone doesn't use SD card.  So, how to backup, then restore to a new phone? Thanks.",
            "Perfect. The functionality that averages your calorie intake over a period of weeks, months, years, etc, makes this one even better than my long-standing favourite simple calorie countER. I have a new favorite. Nice work!"

            "Works great! App is extremely user friendly & you don't have to set up log in/ password if you don't want to. Food are easy to find. It gives you the option to choose between different WW programs, so you get to choose which one you would like to use. Free, unless you prefer pro option (which allows for extra micronutrient tracking, and pairing with Fitbit or other device) Wonderful app!",
            "This app is better than any I've ever used,including WW and my fitness pal. Having the macros is very informative,and it connects with my Fitbit! The recipes are regular food,not a bunch of weird stuff. So easy to use. All this for only 19.99$ a year! WW cost that much for one month and they don't have your macronutrients. Try it,I promise you'll love it. Tracking on MyDiet Daily can and will help you lose weight the healthy way.",
            "This is a good app. However, it isn't always consistent. When you log your food, if you change the serving size, it will sometimes zero out the points. There are still some glitches in the programming that need to be worked out. Overall, a good app. Update: I paid for the extra features, however, it wasn't really worth the cost. I thought it would give me more access to restaurants, however, restaurant selections are EXTREMELY scarce. This is an area that can definitely use LOTS of improvement.",
            "Loving this app I struggle with eating healthy and have yo yo dieted for years. I have tried different food trackers but they didn't seem to fit right. Once I found this app and seen it correctly counted points and was easy to navigate I have stuck with tracking everything and within a few weeks started to see weightloss and feel better :)",
            "This app is AMAZING. I recently lost 12lbs on weight watchers and decided I didn't want to pay $26 a month every month just to get better health so I looked for an alternative. This is almost the same as weight watchers just takes a tiny bit more work to be sure the points are correct, which you can do with a quick google search. Don't hesitate! It's so affordable and a great deal for something that will help me regain my health again. I've already recommended this app to several other people!!"

            "I love this app. Very easy to use and lots of options available. I only wish there were ways to customize based on preferences and food allergies so you can switch out comparable foods, or even add that. But still a great app. Love the grocery list!!",
            "I love this app. It gives you such a great variety of diet plans and what each one targets. I had my gallbladder and and needed a low fat diet and I found it here. I love the simple shopping list for each week which has made it so simple. The only thing I would like differently is for there to have every week different so you aren't repeating the week before. Overall awesome!",
            "I think I like the meal reminder the best then the grocery list and the variety of plans third. Been using it a long long time.",
            "I miss the support groups that used to be on the app. I met someone from the Netherlands and we became great support tools for each other, and good friends. I miss the \"walk with me\" support group where all the ladies would challenge and encourage each other to walk everyday. This used to be the best part, and it was what made you different from all the other diet apps. Please consider bringing it back.",
            "I've had this app through several different phones over the years. However, even though I've upgraded to pro and there have been updates, there never seem to be any new plans. I saw one reviewer mention keto plans, and I was REALLY hoping for the exact same thing! With as popular and well-supported with research as keto is, you'd think they would add it on here. Oh well......come on, guys, change with the times! Science does, and so should you. :-("

I don't work for free, no, but I guarantee this app doesn't amount to your day job, am I right? 😉",

            "Thank you, thank you, thank you!😁😁😁 Finally a nutrition carb/calorie app that gives you just the information you want/need without a lot of other stuff. And without jumping through hoops to get it! I cant count how many other apps I've installed and uninstalled because they were just too hard to use, too overwhelming, or too diet centered! Thanks for making this easy to use and really helpful. Sometimes simple is best! Five stars all the way.",

            "I love it it will help me with my keto dite it is good or not",
            "I wish instead of 100 grams, something's should be measured differently.  For example an egg roll should be measured per egg roll for the carbs, how do I know how many grams it is."

It has helped me reach my goal weight and eat healthier (of course, self-control is a big factor). I highly recommend this app!",

I've lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks by trying to stay at or below 80 carbs. You have to look up the amount of carbs in the food you eat. The app will not do that for you, but that is easy enough simply by looking at the nutrition label or a quick search on the internet"

The plans are chaotic, they do not adapt based on feedback and input, and coach feature is worthless. It can be used only as basic tracker, but there are other options that work better and with reminders.",
            "UI is actually quite... unclean, like not really minimalist, and not really inforgraphic. Especially for first page, sections separated quite bad. If you follow the circle you should add the statements ( insulin up down, keto, autophagy...) onto the circle directly and touch icons for more information. Also the circle is boring, even i reversed it, nothing happened and such an eyesore to see the time elapsed but the circle still run remaining.",
            "I really love the update to the Coach, but now I'm having issues with not getting the notifications. They were working fine last week. I've had to reinstall the app, losing my progress. Hopefully this is the last time I'll have to do that. I really love this app",
            "My notifications aren't working since the latest update. I made sure notifications were enabled in my settings. I turned them all off & back on in the app too. I don't want to have to install a separate water reminder app or set alarms for when my fasts start & end!",
            "I would like a refund. This is the most useless app ever. It doesn't even show on your apps screen. You have to go to Google store to open every time. Just refund my money. I downloaded last night and am requesting my refund back onto card. Nit happy.....Leda Green"

            "I love the layout of it however the database is letting it down. I'm adding things to the database on a nearly daily basis. Apart from that I like the app. None of the add nonsense that people have talked about in other reviews.",
            "In-app marketing is too offensive. I want to test the app and if I like it, I will buy the premium version. Constant pop-ups are very annoying, especially after adding a meal! I know that you earn money from ads, banners are okay and maybe one pop-up per day, e.g. after adding first meal, but not all the time. This is really annoying and does not encourage to purchase the premium version. It does quite the opposite.",
            "The app has potential. It is missing a lot of products from the U.S.. adding them is cool but then sometimes I make a mistake and it's hard to correct. something is wrong with the default calories calculator, it says that I need a deficit everyday of 1000kcal to lose 1lb per week, but to do that in reality you only need 500kcal deficit per day. The goals page is all messed up. It says that it takes 11 weeks to reach my goal of -8 lbs, but the rate of weight loss is 1.76/week.",
            "Calories and activities imported from Google Fit does match. Also would be nice to be able to connect it to Huawei Health. Database is missing a lot of products. There should be an option to additionally add a picutre when adding a missing product so you can verify it and remove duplicates. Reward users for growing the database. It would be nice to suggest activity or meal based on current tracked data to meet the daily targets. Possibly to edit ingredients in meals and save them for later.",
            "My first impression is an 9/10. The information that offers it is really complete. Furthermore, you can connect it with other Apps, what it is really helpfull if you want to track your diet. The design is not bad, I like it more than other Apps like My Fitness Pal, this could be improve by adding a Pie Chart to see the proportion (percentage) of carbs, protein and fats in your dayly or weekly intake"

            "Android Phone? - Don't Bother! Being taught to use this app in the hospital to manage my newly diagnostic child, I was horrified to find that once discharged from the hospital and left to \"go solo\", everything that I had learnt was void as the app you rely so heavily on, doesn't actually work on android. Extremely disappointed that I paid my money in good faith for this app, only to discover that it does not have half the foods and you cannot change your weights to get exact carbohydrates.",
            "Last update was 2018, no replies to emails! This is very lazy and evidences a lack in development. Many common foods are missing or it is fussy regarding food names. This could easily be resolved with more variables and again evidences lazy development. It's also slow to use and states \"downloading\" every time launched. The included basal bolus system is useless, you have to manually calculate carbs and there isn't anywhere to input a correction ratio, or reduction ratios for exercise etc.",
            "Good idea but outdated. Given the current technology this app could be improved further. For example, link with online database, such as calories king and so on. Healthcare workers encouraged me to use the app, but I don't find myself beneficial from it because the database is limited.",
            "I saw thought that this app would be Perfect for helping me to control my type 1 diabetes but it just does not contain enough info on uk foods. I therefore, cannot give a higher rating. Check out weights of anything on toast 737g not! When will you update and rectify. This is , after all, a paid for app.",
            "Brilliant app was recommended to get it by doctor at the hospital as I'm diabetic to help me count carbs on what I eat and it's great, it also tells you the fat content, calories and protein for different portion sizes on quite a range of different foods and takeaways. Would definitely recommend"

            "This app is simple to use and to the point. The ads are also not invasive or distracting. Overall this app is A great way to keep track. However, it would be great if there was a feature to view a snapshot of what the user inputs for the week and/or month. How it is now, the user must click on each day to see what was previously input on the calendar And that is a bit annoying.",
            "I really like this app--it's easy to use, and I love many of thr features. The only thing I don't like (and I dislike enough to not give 5 stars) is that there is no category option for \"dessert,\" but there is a tag for \"junk.\" I want to be able to log my after-dinner chocolate with a label that describes what it is (not a \"snack\" or just \"food\"), but the lack of option other than \"junk\" feels annoyingly diet culture-y and shaming. That one flaw aside, this app is very good and suits my needs",
            "Great + easy to use. Would be nice to edit some of the categories mainly on the drink names as there is things I don't drink, such as energy drinks. Otherwise a good app, like that I can export the CSV to Google sheets and it's quick to add entries.",
            "Simple but effective. I was looking for something in which to record the meals that I was eating so that I could be more conscious about what I was eating. I wasn't interested in counting calories but I was interested in eating less. This works perfectly, though I do wish it populated a list of my prior meals in a drop-down rather than do the incremental search that it does.",
            "At the very beginning i thought what kind of journal doesnt keep track of days Pryor days was about to delete. I have since figured it out. Not only does it track food and water it as few other helpful things to track exercise, meds, supplements and a other other button. I will find this app to be very useful. I would have however been happy with a little tutorial."

By popular request we&#39;ve also added new lower cost purchase options that come with a free 3 day trial. As always you can still purchase a lifetime premium membership and never pay recurring fees. This update fixes some minor bugs.",

            "One month after android 11 update and the keyboard bug still exists. Keyboard does not come up trying to search. Recommendation after I gave feedback was to downgrade to android 10, really?!? Not really a solution in my books and a month is too long without an update required for compatibility. I just feel stuck as this has a lot of my journey stored here but would not recommend at this point in time.",
            "I really like the simplistic idea behind this app, but fact like basic foods like raisins and quark are missing, and there's no food search function (you have swipe to find the right item), makes it difficult to commit to it. Even though I like the food icons and thr cute visuals, UI is way too cluttered. Finally, measurements are not always consistent in each food (eg. No gram unit available in all foods). I'd be happy to try this app on it's next iterations to see if they fixed these points.",
            "I had given this 5 stars. I even paid for the premium version in 2017. But then there was an update, and the premium version stopped. The ads have returned and the app lost some functionality. I'm not going to keep paying for new premium versions after every update.",
            "Great free version that is a good guide to tracking your macros. Not an exact measurement but close enough to be very useful.",
            "Great app! Takes a bit to figure out how to navigate thru it, but that's the way it is with all apps. I'm not doing keto, but still tracking my macros. I have lost 5 lbs (maybe some water weight, but i have increased my H2O intake) in a week because I am aware of what I am eating, thanks to this app. Well worth the $25."

You can now share your progress and foods with friends and family too. The piggy bank is now a rolling 30 day bank that updates dynamically when you add/remove food in the past OR resets at the beginning of each month. The choice is yours! This minor update fixes an incompatibility with our Macros app.",

            "Great little app that does exactly what it says it does. Easy interface with awesome icons and graphics. It does need calorie expenditure for workouts though. Or at least I haven't found it yet. Still worth every cent for the add free version.",
            "Just amazing! Tried a few apps but this one beats them all. Truly thank the developers. Gives you full control of the breakdown of your diet (% macros) and a tailored goal. Once you add items it automatically deducts from your daily goal so you can plan ahead. Stupid simple indeed. Tip my hat to you guys",
            "Great app. It makes it easy to keep track of what you are eating with barcode scanning and quickly searchable lists of foods. You can carry your own recipes easily and then add them to your day while changing portion size on the fly. It is simple to set the macro balances that you want as well. The only real improvement would be that it would be nice to be able to access a report of your micronutrients as well. Although that isn't as important as easy access to your macro's.",
            "once I figured out how to use the app, it has been amazing. I wish there were step by step directions on what each thing is and how to use it, such as the calorie bank. I was able to find the answer on Google. there is probably still more to this app that I am not aware of. the next question on this asks if we can import recipes. I'm not aware of being able to do that but I will definitely be asking Google",
            "App is basically useless unless you buy the premium version. None of the features work in the \"free\" version and every time you attempt to use one you're simply prompted with an \"upgrade to premium\" ad. Don't waste your time downloading this."

            "I am using the paid version and I love it! I love the reminders and the lessons. I especially love the recipes and the fact that you have a TON of vegetarian options. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that recipes get removed! I plan my meals a week in advance and I went today to prepare one and the 3 of the recipes are gone! There also isn't an option to download a .pdf to save for later. Please fix this and i will rate 5 stars!",
            "Great app. I've experimented with IF in the past, with great success. However, with COVID and working from home, it's a lot easier to slip up and eat whenever you want to. This app pops up periodically reminding me that I need to drink water. It's nice to have a reminder, which should prevent me from mindlessly eating when I'm not scheduled to. My first foray into IF was about 2 years ago, and I lost 85lbs in total. I'm not quite where I was before, but I'm still dealing with about 50 extra lbs. This app is highly recommended, as long as you use it as intended.",
            "Great app, takes a little learning. I was initially confused by the words encouraging me to 'End Fasting' when I was only hours into current fast. This resulted in a few badly timed fast records, but the ability to edit fasting start and end times saved me. I often forget to record my water intake, despite the much appreciated reminders from the app. The retroactive edit ability for water intake does not allow me to click on a day and edit. No response when I try to select a day's water record.",
            "Easy and Convenient app. I love that I can see my progress so easily!! I wish I could connect to my community though. It disappeared as quickly as it appeared???? I also wish I could communicate with my fasting buddies, at minimum send them an emoji or something. I use the paid version so I'm not sure what I'm getting that's any different than the free version... I don't use the recipes or the tools, I just use the trackers. All in all I'm happy I have the app though to stay on track.",
            "Love this app. I'm using the free version. There are enough features to get you started on IF. You enter basic info about yourself & they suggest a plan. You can modify the IF hours. Cool feature shows start/stop times. During fast you can see at a glance how long you've fasted/and time left. Reminders to drink water w/place to log amount. Didn't rate 5 stars because I wear an off brand fitness tracker (not listed on app) so steps are not recorded & no way to manually enter steps taken."

            "The app is currently not working. I just purchased a subscription and as soon as i go to create goal i get stuck on the weight field. As soon as i put in the text (kg -> 105) the app gets stuck and crashes within seconds. I then need to log in again and start all over. Also you have to choose the birthyear from an interface which forces you to manually skip from month through month starting at jan. 1984 until you make it to your birth year. Thats very inconvenient.",
            "I was aware that there was no German food database, which is fine by me, but even after entering items that failed bar code scanning manually they still won't be detected by scanning the bar code afterwards. If you have no idea how to setup your calories and macros, the app is useful. For tracking food (outside of the US I guess), not so much.",
            "Amazing, worth 5 times what you pay. Can't say enough good things. I've been counting macros for over a year, had carbon now for a month or two and my results have gone through the roof. You're getting a macro coach (and a really great one at that) for practically nothing. If you put in your food accurately I have no doubt any one would have less than amazing results.",
            "Really annoting data entry issues. 1) when swapping to other apps like a notepad, picture of your scaled food, or spreadsheet, it dumps all of your work and the app restarts. It doesn't save it untill the end. It doesnt hold its place in the background. So it doesnt utilise cache data effectivly like it could. 2) When scanning something it doesnt appear on your most recent. I'm not sure if you have the option to add it to your my foods list.",
            "I love the functionality of the app and how it is all set up. However, how can you put a product out in the market, charge top dollar and out of 10 products I scan, all of them have the wrong nutritional information?!?! Dr.Layne and team, please fix this, it is annoying and frustrating. Get a better database to pull the info from."

The only reason for the missing star is that the app is still young but with time the amazing team of 2 will improve on it."

Over time, this results in weight loss, with less effort.\r\n\r\nWhat do the colors mean?\r\n\r\nHol Colors (greens, yellows, and reds) indicates the calorie density of the food (with green being lower).\r\n\r\nGreen foods have more fiber and water, giving them less calories while keeping you full. Eating green foods is also healthy eating: fruits, vegetables, salad greens, and other foods packed with nutrients.

When you limit calories, you might think you have to eat less food. But what if you could eat different foods, ones that have more fiber, water, and nutrients? That’s what happens when you eat green foods! You’ll get to keep eating, you’ll be getting more fiber, water and nutrients, and less calories, for easier weight loss. It’s more than a calorie counter!\r\n\r\nCan I actually lose weight without being hungry?\r\n\r\nAll weight loss diets work if you eat less calories. Fasting restricts calories by time. Keto eliminates carbs, which could be a big source of calories. But you want sustainable weight loss - where you feel satisfied (come on, we all love carbs, and who wants to skip meals and be hungry!). With Hol, you eat foods that make you more full physically, by having more fiber and water (they tend to have lots of nutrients too!). So you get to keep eating (now eating healthy), and you’ll lose weight - and you’ll get healthy fiber, water and nutrients too!\r\n\r\nWhat about non-green foods?\r\n\r\nYellow and red foods can still have lots of nutrition, and don’t need to be avoided! But if you find you’re running out of calories too soon in the day, and you feel hungry, you should add more green foods. They’ll allow you to eat more, fill you up without filling up your calorie budget and sabotaging your weight loss.\r\n\r\nAre all green foods nutritious?\r\n\r\nLots of them are! Most green foods are whole foods (sound familiar?). When food is processed it’s either for economic reasons, or to make it tastier, which usually means removing fiber and water and adding sugar and more calories without adding nutrition. By tracking calorie density, you can identify foods that tend to be less processed, having more fiber and better nutrition. \r\n\r\n\r\nGive it a try!",

            "Disappointing. First let me say I really want to use this app. Only 1 I can find using calorie density. Problems tho. Portions mostly in metric, scanner can't seem to read bar code, food search only uses 1 word at a time so can't search for example \"oscar meyer\" searches oscar or meyer so narrowing the list of possibilities is almost impossible. I'd be willing to pay for a good app that works well.",
            "The barcode scanner doesn't work. I paid the two dollars to get recipes and the recipe bank has only five or six vegetarian recipes, almost all drinks. I can't input foods they don't already have in their database.",
            "Love this app!! Have used others and this one works. Makes you rethink how you view your food and food choices. Food log is easy to use. Makes finding right foods, right portions and brands easy so you do it. Colour coded foods help you make better choices every day. Set personalized goals to lose weight, gain weight or stay the same then log, track progress and see results. Awesome app!!",

            "Cool concept but it doesn't let you schedule times. The programing not allowing for times to be set properly. Freezes and crashes. everytime I opened the scheduler it would choose random time of the day on its own around 1 am.",
            "The 'skip meal button' is right underneath the 'ok' button with no way to change the meals marked as skipped. The app comes up over EVERYTHING so on a work call it will pop up over it and blare the alarm. It has absolute priority which is awful. I liked the concept but there's a few things they need to change with this app.",
            "This is app is great if all you want is a reminder to eat and at what time. Only thing that would be good to change is that if you accidently hit skip meal instead of eat meal. That you could change it back. Otherwise it's good.",
            "It gets the job done, I just feel like there's too many notifications outside of that you can make your own sound if you like but if it was just a quick let's eat or skip the meal option 5 but it's like two more notifications after the meal reminder I kind of think it's unnecessary each time",
            "I love this app for the theoritical explanation of meal importance, for cute design and for notifications! But that's really inconvenient, when I accidentally tap meal or set the other time of meal after I set it eaten, so it became missed. But in general app is nice!"

            "Decent app but there are a couple of things that let it down. One is entering weights; you have a roller type number thing which is annoying when you've got a fair amount of weight to enter. Feels like you're scrolling it forever. It should just be where you enter the number. Much easier. The second one is the scanner. It works but it gives you some weird points sometimes. Like frozen veg is free points but sometimes it will point them.",
            "Hands down, I've never been more disappointed in an app. It makes using the WW program WAY more trouble than it's worth. WW is great. It's always worked for me. But this app is just a headache. Frequents disappear and or don't save. Saved meals are not accessible or reusable except for on the day they were saved. Horrible interface, not even remotely intuitive. Makes me regret locking into the program for 6 mos.",
            "Generally I like using the app, it's great that everything is in the one place, but I think the recipes could be organised better and give users the opportunity to review them/add notes to what works/doesn't.When saving recipes to favorites how about having sub folders, maybe starters, mains, deserts or meat dishes, vegetables or sweet so you don't have to scroll through all of them each time. When you do look at one and go back, it takes you back to the beginning again, which is annoying.",
            "For a paid app/service, the functionality is very poor. The worst investment/purchase I ever made. The app doesn't recognize the most simple foods. Further, I also read a comment here, that cancelling your subscription is very difficult. Information is hidden far away on the WW site. Also with me they continued to charge my account after I cancelled. It looks like that is a (deliberate) part of their business model. This is seriously not how customer service should work.",
            "I am confused by this program, nothing is very much explained aside the smart points and how to count them. Almost everything I consume in a day is worth the whole stack of points I have for my entire day, its crazy! I get that I need to consume more greens and such, but did I really pay for an app to only prove that point out to me? After a month on this \"program\" I did lost some weight, but at the cost of starving almost everyday, relying a lot on water. I wish I could share more about this..."

            "I've been using the free version and new to fasting, so took a little bit to get my head around. Taking is easy once worked out. So I was curious about benighted of the paid version so agreed to a few trial, but now it won't load any of the Explore section (either device). Did before I subscribed so I'll give it a few days and so if it sorts itself out, others I guess I'll cancel and stick to the free version.",
            "I like this app. I have been able to adjust to the eatting times. The only thing that could be could be worked on is the timing of logging food. Log your food when you eat it. You can't not change the time in the app, well if you can I have not figured it out yet. Other then that I like this app. I would recommend it. The constant reminder to drink water has also been a big help.",
            "I am so glad I found this app ❤️ I was going through a stressful period and the app helped me going back on track... It s so easy to use and I love how it s structured and designed (I love to have cute apps on my phone) plus seeing an overview of your activities during the week really push me to be more healthy and create good habits. I will recommend it to everyone 👍 thank you for you wonderful work.",
            "Update broke it for me. Trying to sign in on my pixel 4 it prompts me to go to email to confirm my identity, I click the link in the email and it opens the listing on Google play store. I go back to the open app and hit continue and it asks me to verify my identity via email again. Loop of hell. Luckily I still am signed in on another device, but this one syncs with Google fit. The other one not so much. Wish it would work for me on this one.",
            "Great app. I like it a lot and it helps me to stay focused. I would like to be able to add custom foods though. Also it would be fantastic if the same account would be accessible on multiple devices. I downloaded it on my tablet and my phone, but i cannot access the accountbon both."

The only critique I have for it is that I wish there was an option to select multiple categories for the recipes instead of just one and hunting for what recipes that fit.

Still really great though!",

            "I can't think of any features not already included. The bolus advisor was invaluable in helping me resolve highs and lows. A1c dropped from 7.0 to 6.0 in 2 months. I created a Notes category and use the filter to see only my Notes. I upgraded to Premium, but the free version includes plenty of bells & whistles. I highly recommend this app! Don't know how I managed without it! Bonus: I can print reports directly from Samsung phone to Samsung printer using Samsung print app.",
            "I have been using this after using Glooko for several years. it is more complex and send to have more features. I switched because it will read my Libre Freestyle sensor directly. The Fitbit integration is not reliable; it is not picking up my weight. MyFitnessPal does a much better job of tracking nutrition. This app should just give up on nutrition teaching and instead integrate with MyFitnessPal. Overall I really like it; I have become a Premium subscriber.",
            "Pulls the wrong numbers from both glucometer and CGM. Using libre cgm and the libre link app will pull a completely different number from this app. When I check with a blood glucose reading, it shows the libre link to be the accurate one (as expected). Also when we use the glucometer, the app always imports a different number from the meter reading. I.e. meter will say 5.6 mmol & the app will record reading of 5.4 Food database is also finicky. Customer service completely ignores me every time.",
            "I do love this app And would use it for all of my diabetic care however I use a Libre2 monitoring system which is not supported by this app. This is not necessarily the fault of this app however is a fault of the libre system for not allowing the monitoring. If you have a libre2 or a 14 day don't bother it will not work",
            "This is a great app!! I showed it to my Doctor on my last visit and he was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with it!! He like it even more when I told him that it connected with my meter!! He noticed the estimated A1C, and later when he got my lab reports back, he made a point to tell me that my level was just as this app had estimated it to be!! Had another visit with this same Dr. on 8/5/20(MASK ON!). To emphasize how impressed he is with this app, he requested to see my latest results from this app!! 👍🏽"

        "description": "Low-calorie recipes app is the best place where you can find the best fitness recipes. For a successful weight loss goal, you need to eat foods having low calories.\r\n\r\nMost diets involve reducing calories in some way or another. Some introduce foods that fill you up faster but contain fewer calories, such as fruits and vegetables in place of processed foods. Other diets restrict your options, and eating the same food sources becomes repetitive and less interesting, so you consume fewer items. Still, other diets combine both strategies, such as diets recommending a low-calorie food such as a tomato, or a special shake that you make, for most or all of your meals. But new research shows that low-calorie diets can help with surprisingly more than your weight.\r\n\r\nA low-calorie diet is one that restricts your intake to 1200 to 1600 calories per day for men, and 1000 to 1200 calories per day for women. Some people go on a very low-calorie diet for rapid weight loss, often consuming only 800 calories a day. This type of diet usually includes special foods such as shakes and soups to replace meals and for added vitamins. Very low-calorie diets can help a person achieve a weight loss of up to 3 to 5 pounds per week.\r\n\r\nFor weight loss, most people should consider a low-fat diet rather than a very low-calorie diet. Less extreme diets are easier to follow. They interrupt normal daily activities less and are less risky if you're over 50 or have other health problems. Also, gallstones have been reported in people who go on very-low-calorie diets. Keep in mind that most diets only work when you make healthy lifestyle choices at the same time. Including increasing daily exercise and reducing your sedentary time throughout the day.\r\n\r\nLOW CALORIE APP EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nOur app is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app.\r\nAs the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you’re cooking.\r\n\r\nTheme Support\r\n\r\nProtect your eyes from being hurt by a bright screen at night by enabling dark mode.\r\nMake your night cooking experience more comfortable at low light.\r\n\r\nSmart Shopping List for your Grocery Needs\r\n\r\nAn organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won’t miss any for the recipe.

            "Very confusing. The app allows you to track and input your meals but there isn't a mechanism to verify progress. You can meet the same objective with an excel sheet. The app constantly solicits for a 5 star rating under the facade of keeping it free. Waste of time.",
            "This would be a great app if everything worked. Updater does not work. Barcode scanner only works half the time and sometimes doesnt agree with nutrition amounts on the food package. The calendar icon to toggle between days does not work. The only reason I rated this app as high as I did is because even with all its faults it is still more useful than the other keto apps in play store. Needs improvement though.",
            "Too many adverts, I realise it is free but I good it would be good to let a user have 30 minutes ad free and an option then to pay to keep it ad free so users could put up with the ads for a free version, but they can be removed for a fee. I gave up after 10 minutes as I was just bombarded.",
            "This app sucks. It lags, I have to tap my screen 10 times to add a food entry, Its also hard to find what food you want to imput. I tried putting scrambled eggs and all these other typ of recipes pooped up like shrimp salad with egg, burrito w/egg like I just ate two scrambled eggs why cant I just tap scrambled eggs and be done? 👎"

            "Uninstalled. I am not paying $10 a month just to \"see\" the recipes recommended. They say this app has SO much more to offer. No it doesn't. You can get exactly the same service, and more on apps like MyFitnessPal or CarbManager. I'll stick with those two. The ONLY thing that made this interesting were the graphics, but other than that a complete waste of time.",
            "I purchased a subscription with the understanding that I would have more recipe options, but was very disappointed. There are not many options, you would end up eating the same meals over and over again. Also, no guidance on intermittent fasting, which is an important part of the keto diet. Furthermore, it said you can cancel at any time, I tried to cancel within 10 minutes, and was charged for a full year. Very disappointing app!",
            "I'm very disappointed with this app. I dont follow any diet strictly, but do enjoy meals that are vegetarian and low carb. I bought the subscription based on the positive reviews, but when I tried to make a weekly menu it was all or nothing, I couldn't have meat options as well as vegetarian menu items. I cancelled my subscription within hours, but I wont be refunded. Why is there no option of a week or 2 free trial?? especially since you cant try the app at all without agreeing to subscribe.",
            "UPDATE: I uninstalled and reinstalled this app and finally it works! I love that this app gives you a lot of food choices, creates your grocery list, takes all the guess work out! Newest app update hasn't produced a usable app. Serving plate with question mark just spins around, nothing more. The last update made the app unusable! I paid for a year and now I can't use the app. I emailed the developers with no response. Id be happy to change my review when the issues are fixed!"

No account, no ads, no data mining, no annoying pop-ups or unnecessary social network tie ins (I know ppl love those but I hate them). This is how most software should be made imho! I am very likely going to buy the premium version to support the devs efforts, even though it looks like the basic version covers everything I need/want.",

            "Wow! This is perfect for me. I have my own combination of diets I use, and i have had to create a spreadsheet to manage my tracking system. Spreadsheets aren't that easy to manage on phone screens. But this app is completely customisable, even to creating one's own entries as user definable units. I've been tracking my food for years, and this app has just made it so much quicker and easier! To the creator, thanks so much, dude. Brilliant job, and I've just bought the full-featured version. 👍",
            "I liked the old app so I really put off this one I don't like change. It's ad-free and fully featured. No need to make a profile, search for brands (or at all), and has options to include any macro and how you want to display them next to the name or not. it shows remaining or total. With a toggle. It's basically perfect and I plan to buy the premium version for the dark theme."

            "Great app! Was super impressed when I reached out and had several emails back and forth. This app was perfect for me because it took all the mental work out of getting healthy. Deciding on a workout routine was intimidating. Eating healthy even more so. Even if I wasn't pairing with a workout, deciding what to eat has always been difficult for me and often resulted in a lot of food waste. Not anymore! I am learning how to cook so much and my diet is tastier than ever actually!",
            "Awesome. This app has everything I need. I can track my weight, meal plan, schedule workouts...and it has stats galore. There is lots of flexibility in the setup, so I can schedule a cheat day each week into my plan. There are plenty of recipes to use, and if you go off-plan you can add things manually. There are loads of features. It's exactly what I was looking for.",
            "App is pretty good, has a lot of features and if you're willing to pay it offers a lot more. I highly recommend his, but 2 stars for the following reasons: the weight doesn't increase weekly by default (at least on the PHAT routine), and it doesn't have T bar or Hex bar as options when substituting for others. Add t bar and hex bar and I'll increase my rating Edit: dev responded and made clarity to all my issues. Highly recommend it",
            "Great structure! I love how much I can customize! There are a variety of options for popular workout routines. Within that I can select my rest days, and choose from a huge database of movements based on my equipment available. By following the routine it is helpful in selection of weight and keeping me on task with appropriate rest time between sets. I want to explore the nutrition/meal component more. It is so cool to have everything in one place. Thank you!",
            "This has been exactly what I've been looking for. The ability to pick from a variety of workout plans, set different goals, meal planner, and the grocery list all in one has been easy to use and makes everything easier and faster for me. A couple things: the food search gets glitchy and there's a delay, and maybe the addition of vegan or no-dairy diet restrictions. Also, am I able to update the days I can work out and the length of time, mid week/routine? Love this app!"

While it's very extensive, some of the results do NOT provide the points, so you must manually calculate, if you can. And, as someone else pointed out, the scan function is not working properly. It does not give you the points per serving. It gives you points for the entire quantity. It's easy to calculate, but having the scan function work would be nice. But thank you for this!!!",

You have the ability to make a shopping list but it's saved within the app and can't be copied and pasted so that I can edit it and give to wife. It offers a metric conversion chart but it's within the app and blocks what I'm looking at, would be better to just update the recipes with the metrics. Other than that looks great and worth the 99c",

            "This app is making me sign in several times a day which is very annoying. Other than that I like it. It helped me lose 50 pounds.",
            "This app is junk!! I try to put in my info and it keeps saying \"Alert fill in all fields\" when all of them are!! The amount of money you spend on the food you would think they could afford for their app to work!!",
            "This app needs A LOT of work! I haven't used it long (2 weeks), but after using Myfitnesspal previously, the problems are glaring. I bought the new South Beach book and thought this app would be a seemless addition to the diet plan. Wrong! 1. The scanner hardly recognizes any of the foods I try to scan whether it is a food on its own or something I want to use in a recipe. 2. The recipes on the blog/newfeed can't be added to your daily log. You have to create a new food for each recipe. This is very time consuming and gets more annoying each time. 3. Some of the nutritional information doesn't show up for some their own recipes!! 4. You can't create a recipe on the log anywhere. You have to create it somewhere else, figure out the nutritional data and then manually enter that by creating a new food. 5. None of the recipes from the new book are online or available in the log. Again, they have to be entered manually! 6. There are few \"Homemade\" versions of foods listed. Most are Southbeach packaged foods or restaurant/grocery versions. The frustration of using this app makes me want to quit the diet altogether!!!!! Please make it more user friendly. I know you want people to buy your prepackaged food (all of which is listed to log), but then don't advertise this as an app for the diet or new books as they come out. They aren't.",
            "The app works fine. Sometimes you have to enter in the nutritional values for the foods you scan, including some of their own products, but once you do it one time, it's there for good. It has made tracking what I need to eat easier than keeping the book on me. I'm down 15 pounds after 2 weeks. My only beef is, what you do after week two is so confusing now. There use to be a phase 1,2, and 3. Some of the foods they send you are labeled in phases, however, the books mention nothing about it now!",
            "I have an LG V35 ThinQ Android phone and it works flawlessly. It is a godsend for planning my daily schedule of foods to eat during the day. I would be lost without it. Well designed and well executed. Maybe folks are trying to install the app on their iPhone 3s and $20 burner prepaid Android phones, or haters or there was a recent update to the app or something. I dunno but it is flawless. If you have a full featured higher end phone, I suspect you will love the app."

Yesterday I used my other app (recovery path) by the same developers to let them know about the issue but have yet to hear anything back from them. I was really looking forward to using these two apps together as a way of replacing my bad habit with a good one but am quickly getting discouraged. I hope this server issue can be fixed quickly so I can update my review to 5 stars.",
            "Amazing app. I've tried a few food journal apps but this is so personal and motivational. I love how it allows you to log your thoughts, why u ate, ur feelings and exercise logs. Oh, it is just such a cute app.",
            "I love this app because it's well-rounded - I can track my low-FODMAP progression as well as my emotions, make notes of what was affecting me, my IBS symptoms, link up with not only my dietician but my other medical doctors. I use it mostly as my diary but a different one to search for low-FODMAP foods. Haven't used it yet, but I look forward to try the learn section to quiz myself.",
            "I enjoyed using this app on my last tablet but since updating to a new tablet, I have been having trouble logging in, a message saying can't connect to nurishly server, please fix this problem as the app is a really good one",
            "Great app, has helped me change my habits. One thing that's annoying is that it always shows one day ahead of the day it is when I go to check what my plan is for the day. I've tried clearing the cache and it's still not working right."

Trying to do a web search with these variables is mostly useless, especially for desserts. I have an intolerance to bananas and most sugar-free desserts include bananas for some unknown reason. Your filtering is not flawless, but more useful than the web. Great for now, but consider multi- condition filters down the road.",
            "For +6 months, the titles for the banner images on the home screen of the app are cut in half horizontally by the banner images under them. You can figure out that the words under a picture say (e.g.) \"50 Seafood Pastas You'll Love\" maybe 40% of the time? Also, can't tap on users in the Reviews section + go to their profile + see their submissions? The 'back' button on a related recipe should take you to the original recipe you opened NOT skip back to the home screen! Argh! Otherwise nifty app",
            "Useless, only good for processed foods. I tried creating a simple recipe using fresh ingredients and whenever I did a search, the only items that came up were processed foods or none at all. For instance, when I finally found chicken tenderloins it gave me a fixed amount and I wanted to have the option to enter a certain weight amount. it wouldn't let me.

            "Buggy, sometimes goes back to initial screen instantly after I opt to select an image from the gallery. The app behaves slow for me. I use the newest Android OS. I find the constant quote pop up annoying and I suspect it plays a role in those lags. I think this app would shine if it adds important features: an option to see stats based on food eaten per day etc. + richer nutritional values per ingredient, antioxidants or whatever (I really love data/stats).",
            "I had high hopes for this app. I tested it by inputting recipes with known nutritional values from a well known highly trusted, respected, test kitchen noted for using scientific testing for their recipes. Every recipes I put into the app was off my a significant number of calories. Sometimes off by 50 calories per serving. The idea is nice, but this dramatic difference in results is not helpful for someone who is trying to get a handle on their nutritional intake. ☹️",
            "Love it. I gave it one star initially because I was confused by what the points meant. Now that I know they are WW points, I love this app. I'm doing WW and knowing the point value of a recipe makes the app awesome!",
            "I put in a desert recipe that I make trying to track net carbs and noticed how high the calculation was. That's when I noticed that the sugar alcohols are still included in the main body of carbs and not listed separately for calculation. Everything else was good though.",
            "I LOVE THIS APP!! I have tried multiple sites to try to calculate recipes and this has been by far the easiest and most comprehensive nutrition calculator I have found. I was a little nervous at first because of some of the bad reviews, but I noticed they had released an app update since then, and they are very responsive to reviews so I know they are reading them. I found the app to be very intuitive. I'm also dairy free so I use a lot of substitutions and I had no problem finding those."

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

        "description": "A keto diet is well known for being a low carb diet, where the body produces ketones in the liver to be used as energy. It’s referred to as many different names – ketogenic diet, low carb diet, low carb high fat (LCHF), etc. When you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose and insulin.\r\n\r\nGlucose is the easiest molecule for your body to convert and use as energy so that it will be chosen over any other energy source. Insulin is produced to process the glucose in your bloodstream by taking it around the body. Since the glucose is being used as a primary energy, your fats are not needed and are therefore stored. Typically on a normal, higher carbohydrate diet, the body will use glucose as the main form of energy. By lowering the intake of carbs, the body is induced into a state known as ketosis.\r\n\r\nKetosis is a natural process the body initiates to help us survive when food intake is low. During this state, we produce ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fats in the liver. The end goal of a properly maintained keto diet is to force your body into this metabolic state. We don’t do this through starvation of calories but starvation of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nOur bodies are incredibly adaptive to what you put into it – when you overload it with fats and take away carbohydrates, it will begin to burn ketones as the primary energy source. Optimal ketone levels offer many health, weight loss, physical and mental performance benefits.\r\n\r\nBenefits of a Ketogenic Diet.\r\nThere are numerous benefits that come with being on keto: from weight loss and increased energy levels to therapeutic medical applications.

There is scientific evidence to support both approaches, so which one should you follow? Well, it turns out that both are important!\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that calories are important, but not everyone knows that when you eat those calories you can do three things with them: burn them for energy; store them as fat; or use them to build lean body mass.\r\n\r\nWhat you do with those calories is determined by hormones in your body, the most important being insulin. Your insulin level is determined not only by the number of calories you eat, but also by the type of calories you eat. \r\n\r\nThis is why what you eat (glycemic load) is as important as how much you eat (calories)!\r\n\r\nThe Low-Glycal Diet™ app by BioFit uses both glycemic load and calories to calculate the number of “glycals” in a meal, which is a better predictor of how fattening that meal will be. \r\n\r\nThe “glycal” is calculated from a formula developed by Dr. Jeffrey S. Dunham, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., medical director of BioFit Medical Group and graduate of Harvard Medical School, and is based on the latest medical research. \r\n\r\nThe total number of glycals in a meal equals the total number of calories in a meal that will be stored as fat.\r\n\r\nThe Low-Glycal Diet™ app by BioFit contains over 1000 easy-to-find foods which are color coded as green (low-glycal), yellow (medium-glycal), or red (high-glycal) if eaten alone. \r\n\r\nYou assemble a meal by choosing the individual foods in that meal. The app then calculates the total number of glycals in that meal and gives you a green, yellow or red result. \r\n\r\nThe number of glycals will change depending on how you pair foods together. For example, eating two fried eggs (a green food) with two slices of cheddar cheese (a green food) will give you a green meal, but eating two fried eggs with two slices of dry whole wheat toast (a green food) will give you a red meal. \r\n\r\nThe ranges of green, yellow and red also change depending on when you have the meal, since eating carbohydrates after 6PM can be more fattening than eating them in earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nYou never have to be hungry on The Low-Glycal Diet™ by BioFit. You can have all the green meals you want in a day, as long as they are separated by two hours. You’re allowed one yellow meal a day and one red meal a week. \r\n\r\nThe fat loss is almost effortless, so start losing fat today!",

Pennington, based on research Pennington did during World War II at DuPont.The Atkins diet is promoted with questionable claims that carbohydrate restriction is the \"key\" to weight loss.\r\n\r\nIn his early books such as Dr Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Atkins made the controversial argument that the low-carbohydrate diet produces a metabolic advantage because \"burning fat takes more calories so you expend more calories\". He cited one study in which he estimated this advantage to be 950 Calories (4.0 MJ) per day.

Sugar alcohols contain about two calories per gram, although the American Diabetes Association recommends that diabetics not count alcohol as carbohydrates.

This may for some create an unsatisfying feeling after consumption which might promote binge behavior that culminates in an increased blood triglyceride level arising from fructose conversion by the liver.\r\n\r\nPreferred foods in all categories are whole, unprocessed foods with a low glycemic index, although restrictions for low glycemic carbohydrates (black rice, vegetables, etc.) are the same as those for high glycemic carbohydrates (sugar, white bread).

            "This app has so much promise but falls short in one important area. I cannot get any recipes I've tried to import via URL. If the import function for adding recipes worked, it would be 5 stars. Without the ability to import recipes via URL, I cannot continue my subscription.",
            "Great way to find new recipes and do meal planning! I enjoy trying different recipes 😋 I wish it would allow me to copy and paste so I can add my variations right on the recipes, to make it more personalized.",
            "I have been searching for a good meal planning app for years and this is the best I have found so far. I wish they allowed you to change plans through the week (for instance I would like to have the vegetarian plan on Fridays and the Restaurant plan on Sundays) but it does allow you to search for a recipe that fits your needs. Also it would be nice to be able to plan more then one week ahead. I live very rural and need to plan out my weeks meals ahead of time.",
            "I'm really on the fence about this app. On one hand, I like the weekly planning thing. But I spent more than a half hour trying to make it respond to any loading or synchronizing, and I couldn't find a way to edit the create a plan. I had a few things saved in favorites but they never showed up in create a plan. On the other hand, I don't like to get a tastey idea in my head only to lose the page because it wouldn't load. I find it hard to want to keep an app when the only way I can choose the option to meal plan for children is to pay 6$/mo. Purchase the full version, sure. But not a subscription. I have 4 people eating in my household. Two of them are 3, two of them are adults. I am not paying a subscription for ideas on dishes for toddlers. I'm also not in this app to read 5 pages of blogs just to look at the recipes to see if i have the ingredients or time to cook the dishes. If i wanted to read blogs, i would. I don't care why Judy started to cook with coconut oil. I just want to see what the recipe is. End of story.",
            "Good concept but not enough recipes. I purchased this app thinking I would have several weeks of healthy meal plans but there are only 2 weeks of that plan and I don't care for much on the menu for week 2. Also, some of the recipes are not very healthy at all and were on the weight loss meal plan. Some recipes are incomplete and lack cooking times or proper measurements. The best part is the ability to create a shopping list from the meal plan you make. Looking forward to app improvements."

            "I had been relatively pleased with the device and app. My wife who is a high carb person blows a \"1\" on the device, and I use her as the test case for seeing if the device gives false positive results :-) However, yesterday the app changed and now the ketosis range/resolution was reduced even further than the previous barely adequate 8 \"Levels\". Now it tops out as a \"6+\" where previously I was routinely in the 7 and 8 ranges in the evening/morning. AND it went back and modified the graph results and changed the Y axis on the scale to only go to 7, where it used to go to 8. I don't want even lower resolution range of ketosis measurements. This was a poor decision and you moved in the wrong direction... If anything I want MORE resolution. If you want to dicker with things then increase resolution by adding decimal points to the nominal results (6.9,7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, etc) or better yet just give us the raw results without the goofy arbitrary scaling that you evidently aren't even going to keep consistent as the latest app change proves... Really disappointed in this latest software update. Please undo this change at a minimum, and add greater resolution if possible.",
            "Every time they \"update\" this app, my device works worse and worse. Now, after 9 attempts in a row, I can't get any reading at all. All it says is it couldn't get an accurate reading and make sure to keep the device away from my face. Yeah, no kidding, I've had my Keyto since it first hit the market. I keep it on the table next to me while it's loading. There is absolutely no way my breath is hitting it while it's warming up. Either this app is trash or the device itself is garbage now.",
            "Bought the keyto pen and three months later started working half the time. Then it just quit altogether. Company no help solving problem. Don't waste your money on the keyto pen.",
            "need to watch screen entire time untilnready, no means of alarm or notification, meaning you are staring at screen for 2 minutes while it warms up. blood test doesnt seem nearly as bad all of a sudden. also, frequently loses association to phone and requires reboot to fix. Edit as of 6/20 and one year of use it hasn't gotten any better and in fact gets worse. It errors out about 95% of the time which wouldn't even be that bad if it eventually worked and didn't take several minutes to calibrate.",
            "Very useful for tracking ketosis. I compared the breath meter to my blood meter and I was surprised how accurate it actually is. Highly recommend!"

They are not a lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWhat the more successful diets have in common is the reduction of foods rich in carbohydrates. Studies show that people who eat low-carb diets and don’t reduce calories lose more weight than people who eat low-fat diets and also reduce calories. In addition, low-carb dieters generally show more improvement for important health indicators like triglyceride, blood sugar, and insulin levels, and more.\r\n\r\nThis app contains proven recipes and tips on how you can make quick, easy Keto recipes.

It has 12, 16, 24, 36 & 72 hours options to try fasting with some tips.. PLUS you can add notes and moods afterwards. It also has history to view your fasting periods. Update: Would do great if a note is included to track intake after fasting",

Its hard enough to fast for long periods, but then throw in your app with a picture of a woman with food and me, fasting. Its a disaster! Change the picture and I'd be happy to rate you 5/5!"

There are minor glitches in app sometimes, but support team is very good to resolve issues as soon as possible. Special mention to: Shrija and Devender for that quick support when I encountered issue with app.",

Update not possible due to above reason.& hence can't take advantage of updated APPs. Please do something so that your Apps can be updated without deleting any existing apps. 19/10/2020. Very good App. It helps in controlling blood sugar levels. Dr.'s follow up is also appreciable in critical condition. Thanks a lot .",

            "Very helpful app for monitoring the blood sugar levels. The facility is that i dont need to go to the Lab, where the blood test charges are high and also risk of infection is very high. This is more economic and cost effective."

Waste of money - 6 months on the program, payment upfront - cumulative weight loss 3kg - could have lost a lot more on my own without spending the inordinate amount of cash. Don't waste your time or effort - not worth it.",
            "Hey team, This app is broke, i put in my details as 20yrs old, 5'8 , 53 kg and target weight as 60kg. It said i fall in Ideal weight category and instead of showing weight gain plans it was recommending me weight loss plans! To cross verify i put in my current weight as 40kg and to my surprise it was still saying i fall in ideal weight category. Either your app doesn't has any weight gain plans or it is simply broke. Kindly look forward to this.",

This coupled with a weight loss of 1kg is very important for me. And what is most important is that it has been achieved not by eating less but by eating right. I am thankful to my coach for guiding me through.",

The app also provide you the shopping list for your Atkins diet food supplies it is easy to follow by choosing and buying the right low carb food source and you will also have the chance to learn what food you should avoid to consume and what food you should eat. You can take a simple \"1 Week Plan Atkins Diet Plan Challenge\" in the Eat Right tab in the app to simply kick start your Atkins Diet Plan ahead.\r\n\r\nAtkins Diet Weightloss Plan low carb diet program uses a powerful life-time approach to successful weight loss. Not everyone's body responds the same way to different approaches to losing weight. The key is to find a match for your body and metabolism. Atkins Diet Plan is also well-known for limiting the intake of sugar and carbohydrates. As a result, many people who follow this diet plan is successfully lost weight and kept it off – even though they had previously been unsuccessful on regular low-calorie diets!\r\n\r\nThe key was understanding that everyone's metabolism can use two different types of fuel for energy – either sugar (and carbs that are quickly turned into sugar by the body), or fat. But the type of fuel you burn can have a big difference in losing or maintaining weight. A typical diet reduces calories, but is still high in carbohydrates (and thus sugar). As a result, many people constantly cycle between sugar \"highs\" (where excess sugar is actually stored as fat in the body) and sugar \"lows\" (where you feel fatigued and ravenously hungry – for more carbs and sugar). For many, it's really hard to lose weight that way.\r\n\r\nAtkins, on the other hand, limits carbohydrates (sugar), so the body burns fat, including body fat, for fuel. This approach leaves the body steadily fueled, and weight is lost, even when more calories are being consumed. Steady fueling also means more constant energy levels all day long, and less hunger and cravings!\r\n\r\nThe Atkins Diet Is a 4-Phase Plan and is split into 4 different phases:\r\n- Phase 1 – Induction The Rules of Induction.\r\n- Phase 2 – Ongoing Weight Loss.\r\n- Phase 3 – Pre-maintenance.\r\n- Phase 4 – Maintenance Keep an eye on your carb balance.\r\n\r\nIf counting calories hasn't worked for you in the past – try Atkins Diet Weight loss Plan – it may be the perfect approach for you!",

Not everyone&#39;s body responds the same way to different approaches to losing weight. The key is to find a match for your body and metabolism. Atkins Diet Plan is also well-known for limiting the intake of sugar and carbohydrates. As a result, many people who follow this diet plan is successfully lost weight and kept it off – even though they had previously been unsuccessful on regular low-calorie diets!<br><br>The key was understanding that everyone&#39;s metabolism can use two different types of fuel for energy – either sugar (and carbs that are quickly turned into sugar by the body), or fat. But the type of fuel you burn can have a big difference in losing or maintaining weight. A typical diet reduces calories, but is still high in carbohydrates (and thus sugar). As a result, many people constantly cycle between sugar &quot;highs&quot; (where excess sugar is actually stored as fat in the body) and sugar &quot;lows&quot; (where you feel fatigued and ravenously hungry – for more carbs and sugar). For many, it&#39;s really hard to lose weight that way.<br><br>Atkins, on the other hand, limits carbohydrates (sugar), so the body burns fat, including body fat, for fuel. This approach leaves the body steadily fueled, and weight is lost, even when more calories are being consumed. Steady fueling also means more constant energy levels all day long, and less hunger and cravings!<br><br>The Atkins Diet Is a 4-Phase Plan and is split into 4 different phases:<br>- Phase 1 – Induction The Rules of Induction.<br>- Phase 2 – Ongoing Weight Loss.<br>- Phase 3 – Pre-maintenance.<br>- Phase 4 – Maintenance Keep an eye on your carb balance.<br><br>If counting calories hasn&#39;t worked for you in the past – try Atkins Diet Weight loss Plan – it may be the perfect approach for you!",

            "This makes absolutely no sense to have on subscription and the lifetime cost is an exorbitant $34.99. It's just a searchable list. You could easily just convert this into a spreadsheet. Obviously a lot of apps like this are being created just to prey on people's problems as opposed to actually helping.",
            "Great app, however I would have given you $3 - $4 for a permanent unlock with no ads. But $69 for lifetime access ! Someone thinks too highly of their glorified list displayer. Let me just burrow your JSON db from GitHub and I'll create my own free version.",
            "I have GERD, and relatively my body rejects many foods, and this app is PERFECT for helping me know which foods I should have and shouldn't have, I hated having to experience my body disliking and rejecting the food for myself, but with this app I no longer have to try things and deal with the consequences, with a click of a button I can see if it'll cause my body to react or not!! And it even lets you know which foods are remedies! Overall this app is great and can really come in hand😁",
            "Not anything I didn't know already once I paid for premium. I was under the impression it would be a diary I could log my trigger foods and tailor my diet. The ingredients aren't elaborate enough it's quite broad. It's basically a paid list on subscription its not worth it at all. Subscription is pointless.",
            "I consider it a really great app. It's nice to have it on hand for a quick search when you're in the grocery store and try to sort things while dealing with acid reflux. Plus it is really great that they continue to update it and give the option to ask for requests for the future list. One thing I hope they'll add in the future is ingredients as well. I constantly look at the list of ingredients for everything, and I'm always nervous with things like malic, folic and ascorbic acid."
