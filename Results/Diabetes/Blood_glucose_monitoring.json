            "It is mostly convenient to enter data, but I'd like the ability to change the defaults in Settings. For instance, my smart watch measures blood pressure on my left wrist, but the default is \"right arm\". For another, the readings I take in the morning up to early afternoon are all 'Fasting', but the app tries to be helpful by suggesting an event label based on an average person's schedule.",
            "I am pre diabetic and need to regularly measure my blood sugar. I love being able to log my numbers in without having to go through a tedious menu. Its also got an alarm I can pgm to remind myself to do it. Oh, and itll show me if my numbers are \"normal\" or \"too high\". I am sure it must have a \"too low\" category, but my numbers are never that low.",
            "Very easy to use, that's main need. Can be exported but I'd prefer it to be able to be saved or backed up to my Dropbox acct. Notes aspect is confusing since it's not actually separate from the actual things you're tracking. That should be a note feature that doesn't get attached to anything. Also the food is only in grams which I'm not going to use. I will be trying other apps, but if my few needs here we're there, I'd have picked my app by now.",
            "Nice clean interface on a basic record keeping app for diabetics. Not a lot of bells and whistles. I use it for my cat's glucose and insulin. I particularly like the quick entry option by pressing + at the main menu to add a reading. It could use some improvement in terms of managing the list of medications, though. We only use one, but I still have to select it from the list each time. There's probably a file I can edit or something, but it's not spelled out anywhere I've seen.",
            "I've used this app for a number of years now. It is a great way for me to keep a record for my doctors as well as myself. Thank you! At this point, however two-years following my last review, I am a bit frustated. Again I am attempting to share my numbers with my doctor. But this time the app does not provide the BP readings for print or any other modes of transmitting; only blood glucose. I am disappointed right now!"

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

            "Great app! I've used several diabetes trackers and this is the best, for average use. It allows you to track the important stuff your doctors ask for and provides exports of data, but it's simple to use and not too complicated to set up. I paid the $1.99 U.S. to upgrade to the Pro version with no ads. It's well worth that fee. ***IDEA FOR THE DEVELOPER*** I like the Measured drop list where I can select a description for each blood test, such as \"fasting\" or \"after breakfast.\" Would you mind expanding that just a little to match what doctors in the U.S. ask for? Here's what I'm thinking: (1) CHANGE the three existing \"Before\" meal options to say \"Immediately before.\" Example: \"Before breakfast\" would become \"Immediately before breakfast.\" (2) ADD three meal options that begin with \"2 hours before.\" Example: \"2 hours before breakfast.\" ***MORE IDEAS FOR DEVELOPER:*** (3) Allow me to set an automatic recurring backup to a cloud drive location of my choice, such as a Google Drive folder. (4) Provide the option of a web interface with quick data entry and data exports. I work on a computer all day so it would be faster for me to type my data into a bookmarked browser page than use my phone. I would only use my phone when I'm away from my computer. (5) You could add some \"about this app\" info inside the app. It might include the official name of the app, links to a web interface, company info, company email, developer info, links to review the app on Play Store, etc. Thanks for considering my ideas and thanks for making a great, stable app that is easy to use and understand!",
            "Great app. Easy to use for recording blood sugar and blood pressure levels and the report feature allows you to easily share your data with your doctor. The ads can be annoying, but for a free app that works well that is only a minor issue.",
            "Looks pretty good. Only thing I would suggest for an upgrade. With the blood pressure it is set on the right arm and it is necessary to change it every time for my left arm. It would be good if there was something in settings to be able to set it to the left arm permanently. Not only for us right-handed people. The bloke at the chemist where I bought my blood pressure device said that it is better to use the left arm. Something to do with the circulatory system.",
            "Excellent app. It helps remind me to watch what I eat. I can see the cause and effect of my choices. So this hells me stay on track. I love the \"Statistics\" data and the fact I can express the data to PDF for my doctor. I highly recommend this app 👍",
            "Great application. Just one thing is missing that there should be combined report chart of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight."

Dario puts it all at your fingertips by connecting the meter directly to your Android smartphone. Simply plug in the Dario meter, apply one drop of blood to the test strip, and get your results on your smartphone in just 6 seconds. \r\n\r\nSMART THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES\r\nDario makes monitoring blood sugar easy thanks to the small size of its medical device. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System combines the meter, lancet and a pack of 25 test strips in a unit so small, it can fit in your pocket. This makes it easy to keep with you, whether at home or on-the-go. With Dario, checking your blood sugar is quick, easy and discreet, one drop at a time. It’s an all-in-one diabetes tracker.\r\n\r\nNOW SUPPORTING BLOOD PRESSURE \r\nDario is more than just a diabetes tracker for monitoring blood sugar. The app also pairs with the Dario Blood Pressure Monitoring System to record and store blood pressure measurements in the same logbook where you track blood glucose. This gives you a more complete perspective of your health. This is important because many diabetics also have hypertension, including up to 80% of people with type 2 diabetes! Track these two medical conditions together to learn more about your health for better conversations with your doctor, and to live better every day.\r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES DARIO DIFFERENT?\r\nDario was designed with convenience in mind, to make it easier to see your medical trends and build healthy new habits according to your results. With insights gained through the Dario app, you may learn which foods and activities lead to better results. You may see how following a treatment plan improves your blood pressure results. Getting this positive reinforcement in real time can be a powerful motivator! One drop is all it takes to see where you stand with this innovative diabetes tracker.\r\n\r\nKEEP YOUR DOCTOR & LOVED ONES IN THE LOOP\r\nKeep your medical care providers and family members up to date on your diabetic measurements. You can share all the data and logbooks inside the Dario application with anyone you like. Simply tap the share icon and select a contact from your address book to share your data instantly.\r\n\r\nCOUNT CARBS & TRACK ACTIVITY\r\nAny diabetic knows how challenging it can be to keep track of carbohydrate intake. Dario does the math for you. Simply tag which foods you ate, and Dario will automatically calculate how many carbs that gave you. With time, you may even start spotting patterns between the foods you’ve eaten and your blood sugar results and learn how to choose foods that your body responds to better. The same goes for activity. With Dario, you can keep track of your daily exercise (even washing the dishes!) and see if it influences your blood glucose levels. The results of this diabetes tracker may surprise you!\r\n\r\nHOW ACCURATE IS DARIO?\r\nDario has been tested extensively to ensure it meets FDA guidance for accuracy, that 95% of measurements are within ±15% of a true lab-tested value. This means you can be assured that the Dario meter will provide results you can trust. Dario has also presented several studies to the ADA, demonstrating how its system helps improve life for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nHYPO ALERT SYSTEM WITH GPS LOCATOR\r\nDario can be a lifesaver! If you have diabetes and have suffered from hypo events in the past, or have a child with diabetes, Dario's hypo alert system with GPS location can help bring you peace of mind. Simply connect the Dario meter to your smartphone, and upon recording a dangerously low glucose reading in one drop of blood, the Dario app will prepare a complete text message, including current blood sugar level and GPS location, to send to up to 4 emergency contacts. Because when a hypo strikes, time is of the essence. And you may not feel well enough to describe your situation. Dario is here to keep you safe.",

With time, you may even start spotting patterns between the foods you’ve eaten and your blood sugar results and learn how to choose foods that your body responds to better. The same goes for activity. With Dario, you can keep track of your daily exercise (even washing the dishes!) and see if it influences your blood glucose levels. The results of this diabetes tracker may surprise you!<br><br>HOW ACCURATE IS DARIO?<br>Dario has been tested extensively to ensure it meets FDA guidance for accuracy, that 95% of measurements are within ±15% of a true lab-tested value. This means you can be assured that the Dario meter will provide results you can trust. Dario has also presented several studies to the ADA, demonstrating how its system helps improve life for people with diabetes.<br><br>HYPO ALERT SYSTEM WITH GPS LOCATOR<br>Dario can be a lifesaver! If you have diabetes and have suffered from hypo events in the past, or have a child with diabetes, Dario&#39;s hypo alert system with GPS location can help bring you peace of mind. Simply connect the Dario meter to your smartphone, and upon recording a dangerously low glucose reading in one drop of blood, the Dario app will prepare a complete text message, including current blood sugar level and GPS location, to send to up to 4 emergency contacts. Because when a hypo strikes, time is of the essence. And you may not feel well enough to describe your situation. Dario is here to keep you safe.",

I continued to use it and my latest 90 day reading was 6.1..I went on 5/15/20 to get a reading and it was 7.8. I record several times a day so I'm not understanding the inaccuracy. I'm very disappointed and will most likely uninstall this app and find another more accurate app.",

It's a great app, but I could use some help accessing my log and 30, 90 day averages. Update: I just discovered that the menu is still there, it's just \"hidden\".

            "I can't think of any features not already included. The bolus advisor was invaluable in helping me resolve highs and lows. A1c dropped from 7.0 to 6.0 in 2 months. I created a Notes category and use the filter to see only my Notes. I upgraded to Premium, but the free version includes plenty of bells & whistles. I highly recommend this app! Don't know how I managed without it! Bonus: I can print reports directly from Samsung phone to Samsung printer using Samsung print app.",
            "I have been using this after using Glooko for several years. it is more complex and send to have more features. I switched because it will read my Libre Freestyle sensor directly. The Fitbit integration is not reliable; it is not picking up my weight. MyFitnessPal does a much better job of tracking nutrition. This app should just give up on nutrition teaching and instead integrate with MyFitnessPal. Overall I really like it; I have become a Premium subscriber.",
            "Pulls the wrong numbers from both glucometer and CGM. Using libre cgm and the libre link app will pull a completely different number from this app. When I check with a blood glucose reading, it shows the libre link to be the accurate one (as expected). Also when we use the glucometer, the app always imports a different number from the meter reading. I.e. meter will say 5.6 mmol & the app will record reading of 5.4 Food database is also finicky. Customer service completely ignores me every time.",
            "I do love this app And would use it for all of my diabetic care however I use a Libre2 monitoring system which is not supported by this app. This is not necessarily the fault of this app however is a fault of the libre system for not allowing the monitoring. If you have a libre2 or a 14 day don't bother it will not work",
            "This is a great app!! I showed it to my Doctor on my last visit and he was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with it!! He like it even more when I told him that it connected with my meter!! He noticed the estimated A1C, and later when he got my lab reports back, he made a point to tell me that my level was just as this app had estimated it to be!! Had another visit with this same Dr. on 8/5/20(MASK ON!). To emphasize how impressed he is with this app, he requested to see my latest results from this app!! 👍🏽"

Haven't been using the app all that long, but more than long enough to be frustrated with having to • repeatedly kill the app, • turn off my meter, • turn them back on and \"hope\" it updates. This morning it took no less than turning the meter on and off at least 5 or 6 times and app at least 3 or 4 kills before it finally picked up the current reading. There's no where I've found that you can hit a refresh for it to activate and upload a reading. The \"Connect\" on the Home does nothing. You can tap and try swipe in every possible direction with absolutely nothing happening with the app.",
            "This app is easy to use, with a clean dashboard and an intuitive interface. It appears that some potential functions yet are to be developed fully, as evidenced by filter options and suggested titles in reports. However, it is a good app for monitoring blood glucose and better than the one provided by the manufacturer of my device.",

            "The original app was good because even if the reader canceled out the sensor because it didn't like it's readings, the phone app would still continue to take readings and give you those results and they were still accurate! Now they both cancel out the sensors even when the sensors don't need to be canceled out, like having multiple low readings in a row will cancel out a sensor even though they're accurate valid readings!",
            "4.5 stars, actually. I went from an A1c of 7.3 to 5.6 in 90 days of using the sensor in combination with my Samsung Note 10+. Works like a charm. Easy and fast. Lots of logbook variables to track meals, carbs, trends, averages, etc. I'm sold! Libra Freestyle. Not as accurate as Dexcim G6 for low bs and high bs, per objective reviewers, but very cost effective. Knowing my BS at anytime helps me to dose more efficiently then doing based on a few random fingersticks several times a day.",
            "Great and accurate!! My endocrinologist has access to the data which helps in controlling my sugars as well as less doctors visits. Helping alot to get my Diabetes under control!!! The only issue i have is that i have the Librelink 2 now and it does not work with phone. Can you please update for use. Thanks!!!",
            "THIS IS A GE CHANGER. My insurance doesn't pay for it...Therefore, it costs me $60 / month.... WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNIE. However!! YOU MUST Follow the directions to know EXACTLY where to place the sensor on the back of your arm. . . Push as hard as u can at 1st contact & make sure you don't sweat for the next hour (; wait 1 hour before working out ;)",
            "I love the phone app. The sensors need a refit. Mine only occasionally stayed on 14 days. The norm was ten and I have had at least four of the last shipment died upon placing them on my arm! Oh, and it usually reads 100 plus or minus my hand held meter. Now that I think about it, I'd take away one of my stars, if it would let me!"

            "I have only been using this app for a few days but I love it so far. It's so easy to check my blood sugars for the day or week. It clearly highlights when they are too high and it's so confidential l convenient that you can share with a clinic. I don't have to worry about writing down my results and bringing them in for visits!",
            "This app makes me more aware of how the food that I eat effects my blood glucose every day. I have seen better results in my A1C levels when I get checked by my doctor every three months! I recommend this app for others who may not have this valuable information to keep their health in good shape! Last A1C was 5.7 !!",
            "Worse app and even the meter looks like a very cheap toy. I have an accu-chek that is way better but it drains battery like crazy Onetouch doesn't always synchronize and when it does it takes few tries. The replies from their reviews is a joke. Same message for everyone having difficulties. I guess some companies get a pass with terrible products like this one and end up getting big market for this garbage.",
            "Just purchased, just starting monitoring, down loaded app and turned meter on and synced. I wasn't sure what I was doing and took couple tries but synced once I followed directions. I am using Galaxy A70. Once I start using app with readings, I will update this . Update I have been using the app for about a month. I found if I open app then minimize it, then press OK on monitor as it is booting up, tap app to open it. Both will sync. Give it a few seconds. I upgraded to 4 stars...",
            "Using it for about 15 months. Easy to use. Clearly shows glucose trends. Companion website makes it easy to produce reports for the doctor to review. Ability to record activity and carbohydrates consumed provides the doctor additional information relating to glucose numbers."

            "No update for Samsung Note 20 Ultra. I've now waited almost 2 months for this update! Ridiculous! I depend on the Dexcom 6 to keep me safe from too low of number or too high. I've have my Dexcom for about a year with no problems, till I bought a new $1200 phone! All of my 600+ apps can manage to keep updates current except for this company. I have called several times, only to be told \"they are working on it, but it could be yet another month\". So now what are we supposed to do?",
            "Just switched to Samsung Note 20 but in doing that I can no longer follow G6 readings on phone. As I review comments from others, it looks like others are having new phone connection issues also. DEXCOM people lets do better with updates on technology as you should be ready to provide us with connections quick after new phones are released.... it's 2020!",
            "This system was made available through my company's health plaIn. I had to wait a month before I could use this app before it would work with my Galaxy S10. Now i have had it nearly two months and no complaints. It has allowed me to adjust my meds for optimum efficacy. I had one bad sensor about a week ago but the next one in the box was fine. Initially I noted the Dexcom was about 30 points lower than my One Touch but discovered it is possible to adjust the Dexcom for more accurate readings.",
            "app does not work with Samsung A10e. the training links within the dexcom glucose program app do not open. 3 sensors 2 failures on the same day very disappointing. Stop sensor button within this app does not work. transmitter was getting readings in the 40s to 60s. Dexcom G6 website says you can calibrate but don't need to. The website does not tell you how to calibrate even if you wanted to. Stab in dark: Menu/Advanced options/optional blood glucose entry after finger prick 2 times 24hrs apart",
            "The rating is purely due to the companies total disregard for hiring/staffing an competent development team, to keep the app up to date with new phones. This should be an issue of the utmost importance for a service pertaining to something so important for the health of their customers. I love the app when it worked but when I got a new phone that literally runs on the same OS as the previous phone (android) and all of a sudden no longer works, it's just unacceptable.

            "Pretty useful app, I like the way everything is organized, presenting the statistics is easy and intuitive. There is Bluetooth compatibility with my glucometer and that makes is really easy to pass my measurements to the app. The user interface is easy and the app is polished in general. Good job.",
            "Almost perfect app for diabetic users. Over all this is a very good program to keep track of your blood sugar, BP, weight, etc... Works fine on Android 8 and 9 with Huawei Mate 10 Pro and Mate 20 Pro. The only problem which I found on Android 9 pie is that fordiabetes Continuously scans for Bluetooth in background.Looks like when you exit app app stay opened in background. Sometimes app don't sync with my Contour Next One no matter that I try also manually to sync my reading on Contour. But most important for me is they have great support. You send mail to support team and you receive answer almost immediately no matter is the working day or not. The best support I seen over last years. On Progress page you can see Weekly and Monthly Average but not Yearly or at least 3 month Average which is important for HbA1c. Statistic can be better. Today the most important things are statistical data. From those data we can see our progress.  Till today I tried many diabetes app but this one is almost perfect. Keep going on this way, you do very good job. Sorry for my English. It is not so perfect like your app.",
            "The app helped me track down my measurements corellated to my diabetes. Really helpfull seeing my progress since downloading the app",
            "Really helped me balance my blood sugar levels. Pretty useful app.",
            "Overall a smooth good looking app. However it's disappointing the Google sync is to sync activities instead of also syncing blood pressure or glucose via custom data type."

You only need to upgrade if you want to use export feature with reporting period longer than 1 week. -------------> Then please explain this: Why does \"MY\" downloaded app say \"TRIAL Version?\"  The dictionary says a TRIAL is \"The act of [testing] something\" and \"A trial of something to see if or how it works.\"  Explain this and I'll re-evaluate with more stars, because it appeared to be a good app..",

The at a glance calendar has proven very useful in my doctors appointments and the option to print a report is also very welcome.  The app has an active developer who was very open to suggestions, many of which came with the regular updates. It was good when I first started using it, it is great now with the steady improvements with all my data still accessible from the time I started, giving me a permanent record of all my home measurements.",

            "Best of the best. No more writting down numbers and food diaries. They literally have thought of everything. I love the easy way it auto syncs wirelessly with my Bg meter, & the way it shows me instant info and trends, counts my carbs and keeps track of my activities and records all of it so when I or my Doc wants a report, it's as simple as sending an email. I haven't wanted for anything since using this app. I promise, give it a try, I'm confident you will feel the same as I do.",
            "I like the app but I have to sync it to my meter every day to track results. This causes my meter to show an error and I have to reset it. I get no error on my meter except when I sync it to the app. I'm considering deleting the app and just keeping the info on my meter. It helps to see it on the app but it's not worth the hassle.",
            "This App is not useful. I could not sync my meter. I tried, tried, tried and tried to sync my meter.",
            "Will not allow me to login using my existing cornerstone for care account. Keeps saying account not found even though I have it open in a tab on my browser so I definitely have one. Won't allow me to make a whole new account. Basically useless & frustrating which is the last thing anyone needs right now."

But it's very hard to find food history to see how to adjust dosing. Food items in the database do odd things when you change serving sizes. Syncing is largely unreliable and often comes a couple of days late. With all of Insulet's money behind this app, I'd expect it to be lots better.",

I blame this on being stuck at home 24/7 because of covid. I was taking 60 units a day. Dropped it to 30 units and now none. So i tried at least a dozen apps. This one fits what i need. Plain and simple, easy to use. Thank you.",

Thank you for making this excellent app available and thank you for your work and effort in creating it. Very grateful🙏",

We need to be able to change the settings from lbs to kg for weight for example. My cholesterol is given to me as xx.xx for example. I want this app but can't use it as it is.

            "Excellent app to monitor insulin and food intake.",
            "I love this app. But have to rate it a 3 star at the moment since it crashes on a fresh install on my phone. I didn't have any problems with it on my old phone.",
            "Love this app. It helps to keep track of all my daughters numbers. It also gives a near spot on A1C calculation. Would recommend for anyone that needs to keep track of blood sugar levels. Just one question, is this available for laptop/pc?",
            "I like this app, it is fairly simple to use and the analysis tools are easy to understand. (I'm a Type 2 who doesn't take meds or insulin..)  However there is a drawback, the app is set up so you can only input values before & after each meal. It does NOT allow for more frequent testing .There is no way to input additional readings.   Today I tested to see  if I peak  2 hrs after a meal or if my blood glucose peaks earlier or later. I tested, 1 hour after a meal, 2 hours after & 3 hours after. There is no way of entering these additional readings into this app (unlike other apps.) I know other people with diabetes who test at bedtime & during the night because they have dawn phenomena (a rise on waking) Some Type 2s test for low blood sugar if they suspect a medication is lowering their blood sugar too much. . As well, Type 1 diabetics often test before exercise, if they suspect hypoglycemia & before driving (driving too low a glucose level is dangerous.)  Therefore I cannot recommend this app for any Type 1s. For Type 2s, I'd only recommend it for those who don't take any meds (other than metformin) or insulin."

Now it looks like an old app from 10years ago. Lots of niggly annoying things when trying to input info and see important information. I've been trying to find a way to revert to an earlier version, but no luck so far",
            "It was great before the upgrade, all the things needed to be input where on the same screen, now you have to go hunting for hidden menues for example logging period ie before /After meal etc, insulins are still not in alphabetical order etc, and graph at top of screen has become smaller and less defined, in all the app has become almost useless, i would revert back to the previous setup if there was an option."

It was partially fixed in December but the persistent issue is no matter what the settings are on, the alarm will sound every 5 minutes, even when opened/cleared, until blood sugar falls back into range. For a high glucose reading for example I have it set to alert me every hour because the insulin takes time to kick in when correcting a high blood sugar but it goes off every 5 minutes. PLEASE HELP!!! Yeah, still not fixed. 10/15",

It was working properly with the do not disturb and still alerting prior to this. Just got off the phone with dexcom support who was not very friendly and basically told I was out of luck and that my Android 11 software wasn't compatible. Please help Dexcom!!!",
            "This app is basically for entertainment value only. It's very unreliable, don't expect to be updated on a regular basis, in fact don't expect updates on an irregular basis. It just doesn't work. if you are planning to use this app in a life or death situation it will probably end up as a death situation. Look elsewhere if you can. My wife is a type 1 diabetic and 95% of time I do not have access to her blood glucose levels.",
            "So far unimpressed. I'm attempting to monitor my child. It's bad enough I can only be a \"follower\" as opposed to being a user on the actual G6 app, not being able to have multiple sets of alerts is getting aggravating. His range isn't supposed to be the same at night as it is during the day, but I keep getting alerts because it's above his daytime range. I'll have to turn everything off in order to get any sleep and that defeats the purpose. That, or change the settings multiple times a day. 👎"

            "I got a Samsung 20 and the app didn't work for months. So out of the blue, I decided to get on and it worked! Then not even 5 minutes of it \"working\" it told me that my device was not compatible. It worked 5 minutes before??? I loved being able to see everything when I had my s9+. It really sucked going back to the receiver, as it isn't as reliable and I tend to forget that more than my phone. Forever wishing the app works again",
            "Needs to be updated. It is not compatible with the Samsung S10+. Prior to using the S10+, I would rate this app as 5 stars. I cannot use it now until they fix this problem. The receiver you get with the Dexcom G6 does not give you as much information as the app does. I was much better able to control my sugar level with the app. Hopefully they will read this review and get on the ball!",
            "Love the whole idea of this monitoring system but i just got a new phone LG velvet 5G and its not compatiable!! Was looking forward to not having to carry around 2 devices. Rolled the dice and hoped it would be supported since this phone just came out a few months ago. I lost! Good deal for the phone but gave up having to carry only one device. Stuck with 2. Hopefully soon there will be an update. Then im sure itll be a 5 star app.",
            "Not compatible with the Samsung Galaxy S20. I asked months ago when it would be compatible with this app and they said they were working on it. Still not compatible and I've had my phone for 7 months. Dexcom please don't leave a generic response about what Android phones are compatible with the app. I don't want an older phone. This app should be compatible. The S20 has been out for over 7 months, what's the hold up?!?!?!?",
            "This app is extremely frustrating to use. Its intentions are good and the platform is pretty good, however the lack of control on the notifications is limited to the point It's almost not even worth having. Give the user more control of the alerts so we don't get notifications every 10 minutes. Pretty sure most people who have this are adults and are serious about their healthcare. This app does not need as much control and notifications it provides."

            "Just received the unit from Dr. So far unable to pair it with phone. The phone sees it and will pair, but the meter will not reciprocate. It's stuck looking for the phone. The meter stays on 'enter pin number' until it shuts down. Also, the manual talks about using a calibration solution, which was not included. Rapidly losing confidence in the thing. I mean if they didn't bother to ensure the paring works, nor did they provide for its calibration. I'm beginning to wonder what the point is.",
            "Glitchy app, it gives me false readings or doesn't even sync to my phone and i have to manually input my readings. I've used 2 different meters, side by side and both gave my totally different readings this app being the worst. I tested twice within a 15 min time span before breakfast, my other unnamed meter gave me semi the same readings around the same mg/dL but Accu-chek readings both were different the first one was 131 and the other was 106 not 15 minutes later during my fasting.",
            "I'm reading some of the reviews and I'm having similar problems. When it downloads I love the layout the information is easy to review and I wish it did a better job of showing you more than 7 days. The problem is, like others, it's not wanting to forward the information to my phone. It's an ongoing problem I generally work around and reconnect. Now it's been a week of not reconnecting. I've done troubleshooting that's corrected it before and really need to be able to review my numbers.",
            "Easy to use app once connected. The only problem was getting it to actually pair with my device. My phone had no problem seeing and connecting to the meter but when I tried to do it within the app it kept failing. After many tries I finally closed everything and gave up. Came back a short time later and tried again then it magically worked. It's only been a couple days but the info seems to be sent to my phone app seamlessly now. Fingers crossed it keeps working.",
            "The Bluetooth connection has suddenly stopped working. I have restarted the app, repaired the meter with my phone, but to no avail. I set up an online account and never got the confirmation email. UPDATE 8/27/20. I found that the data transfer works if I open the app before taking the reading. Otherwise, seems to be working OK."

I try to choose my options of medical treatments, and I can't get past the unit basal rate without it telling me there's a zone error, close app and log in again. I've done that 5 times. Still the same. It's a shame because I was recommended this by other t1s, was hoping for it to succeed.",

One issue I found was that I kept clicking on the \"Skip Second Measurement\" button by mistake when I instead wanted to enter the second measurement. My suggestion is to ask the user for confirmation \"Do you wish to skip the second measurement?\" before continuing. This will prevent errors in entry. Thanks.",

            "Yeah, I paired with the device in 10 min! You probably didn't read the instructions. If you own the app and click in the question mark (app digital manual) in order to pair you need to use the LAST SIX DIGITS OF THE DEVICES SERIAL NUMBER (ON THE BACK OF THE DEVICE). Then is syncs in seconds. RTFM! I will admit they should have made this clear in the initial set up for those who are technically challenged.",
            "The True Metrix Air meter works OK, but this TrueManager Air app is the worst. You can't edit the log book or add comments or basically do anything with it. Plus, it doesn't work with a slew of phones because they don't update the app. Zero support for the app. I have a Pixel 3 phone, but the app only works with Pixel 2 phones and before. Google is up to Pixel 5 now and hasn't made Pixel 2 phones for over 3 years. Get my point.",
            "I've used this app for 3 years. Early this year, there was an update. The only change I've found was a negative. You can no longer save a note. I contacted customer service & told them about it. I was transferred to teck support & told him about it. I could tell he was unaware of the situation. He took my number & said he would look into it. He called me a little bit later & said there were going to work on correcting his. That was about 4 months ago. It's still not fixed! Still disappointed!",
            "At first it took a few tries to get it to connect to the meter but once you do everything works great.. A tip for you though..when you go to connect the meter make sure you pair your phone and meter first and keep your bluetooth turned ON in the meter. And when it asks for the pairing number look on the back of your meter and use the last 6 numbers to your meter.",
            "I have paired my device with my phone and everytime I try to sync it with the app it truly does nothing, I cant really rate this app a ZERO but I feel as if that's what it should get, after pairing with the phone it does not matter cuz the app does nada!! I mean why is this all even an option, plus I cant connect my walgreens true Metrix air with anything what so ever!! I'm angry!"

            "It could be improved by the use of ability to write notations in the application and also take pictures and included in the daily notes. I love another app called my sugar which relies on finger sticks to tell the app your blood sugar but doesn't have the continuous blood sugar monitoring ability. if Dexcom could utilize some of those aspects that would be great. Main reason why I use the Dexcom app is for my G6 sensor and being able to utilize my phone and a receiver to let me know what my blood sugar is doing at all times.",
            "unbelievable like all other reviews, I need an app that monitors my blood and can send it to followers on the follow app too. I do not need a tutorial manual on how to use the real useable app, which is what this is.. This is a disgrace! I don't understand what dexcom is thinking, but I think giving them a call or writing them every email in the world is necessary for them to make an app that works on all phones so it can save more peoples lives!! I wish I could write more, but the word limit..",
            "Horrible having to carry around 2 devices, because Dexcom G6 isn'tcompatibleto Samsung or Fitbit. This is a medical device😡Please fix this problem.",
            "Wow. Gotta wonder how some of y'all actually function on a day to day basis. It's a SIMULATOR. Of course it's not going to monitor YOUR glucose. 🤔🤣 The actual apps (g5 and g6) work for Android. If your phone isn't in the list of \"supported\" phones there's ways around that. You have to know how to work the Google searchy clicky thing though. So, not much confidence in that being a solution. 🙄 SMH it's right there in the name of the app AND the description. Sim-u-la-tor.",
            "I rate the app as 4, but the service you all provide supplying the sensor is horrible. They are doing the app greatness an I justice by not supplying its customers the product in time to even use the app. Yes, I'm a Dexcom G6 patient (was). They never send the sensors."

        "description": "Health2Sync has been selected by Healthline as one of the \"Best Diabetes Apps of 2019\". \r\n\r\nHealth2Sync helps you combat diabetes by making blood sugar tracking more meaningful.  You can easily log your blood sugar, blood pressure, weight, medication, diet, exercise, and mood through the app.  Health2Sync provides you helpful feedback based on your blood sugar records to help you manage diabetes. \r\n\r\nKey features of Health2Sync:\r\n\r\n-- Blood sugar tracking --\r\nManually entering your blood sugar records is fast and intuitive with Health2Sync.  Along with your blood sugar readings, you can enter notes, select medication you used, food you’ve consumed, and attach photos.  Alternatively, you can also purchase the Health2Sync Smart Cable, which will allow you to upload readings in bulk from your glucometer.\r\n\r\n-- Blood pressure tracking --\r\nYou can track your blood pressure readings as well with Health2Sync.  Enter your systolic, diastolic, and pulse readings and easily see how you've been progressing with blood pressure control.\r\n\r\n-- Weight tracking --\r\nWe know how important weight control is for Type 2 Diabetes, so you can also keep track of weight changes with Health2Sync.  You can enter your weight and body fat, set goals, and easily see what progress you've made.\r\n\r\n-- Dashboard --\r\nEvery time you open the app, you will immediately see a dashboard that gives you a quick analysis of your recent blood sugar history in table and graph formats.  You can see whether your readings are in range, the movement of your readings, and you can even chart differences between your before meal and after meal readings.  \r\n\r\n-- Diary --\r\nDiary allows you to easily review your past blood sugar records.  You can quickly see what factors contributed to a high or low reading.  You can also view the diary in a table format to quickly compare before meal and after meal readings.  \r\n\r\n-- Partners --\r\nWe know having diabetes can make you feel lonely sometimes.  You can invite your loved ones to become partners with you on Health2Sync.  As your partner, not only can they stay on top of your blood sugar changes, they can also provide you warm encouragements to keep you going.\r\n\r\n-- Data Export --\r\nThe data you enter in the app can be exported as a PDF Report or Excel file.  You can e-mail this data to your doctor directly from the app, or mail it to yourself and print it out prior to your next visit.\r\n\r\n-- A1C tracking --\r\nA1C gives you a long-term indicator of blood sugar control.  You can also keep track of your A1C history and view your trends with the Health2Sync App.\r\n\r\nWe know that testing blood sugar can be painful and tiring sometimes, we really hope Health2Sync can make diabetes management more meaningful to you.

            "New design is terrible. Increased motions to make an entry is rediculous the old way was so simple ...I am not impressed. The old app made daily entries simple now it adds 3 steps before I enter my glucose. Granted they are the same entries as before but I did not always enter those items at initial entry if I was in a hurry to enter and go, editing them later.",
            "The UI is very cumbersome since the v2.0.3 update. Takes more effort and clicks to enter data. Constantly having to do extra presses to open and close keyboard. Diary screen used to be simple and show more data, now confusing and has big icons that add no value and waste space. It tries to force your entries into certain time periods automatically which then requires additional work to override if you don't eat or go to bed at exactly the same time every day. This app is going downhill.",
            "Good day, I already subscribed your app for my glucose management program, it's good app and I like it's very much. Request to add more model for weight scale such as Mi Body Composition 2 and also can link to Mi fit apps for batter use, and custom date setting (mm,dd,yyyy to dd,mm,yyyy ). Thank you in advance and waiting your feedback",

Part 2........I gave your app a second chance........ok I have finally gotten this app paired with my accu check and it takes 3 or 4 times to attempt to push the info over to the app. The accu check app works seamlessly when doing this. BD you need help with your crappy app. Still don't believe this is a good app at all",
            "The navigation in the app leaves much to be desired. When the first opened over half of the screen is taken up with one question. The bottom portion has three \"articles\". There is no option to browse through information and content. I'm better off surfing the web.",

Early on, I found a way around the annoying ads which appear when you save a reading using the New Entry button.

            "I could never keep my bg in control before I started using the CGM/this app. My extreme highs and lows have settled into a very minimally variable horizontal line within range most days. My time in range is phenomenally good. It's as if I was blind before, but now have glasses to see. I love this app! And I am feeling so much better because my glucose control is better. I have energy, can think/concentrate, have lost weight because I'm no longer \"feeding the insulin, and sleep better.",
            "Once again...for as advanced as the G6 is, the app should be compatible with more than just the \"latest\" IPhone. I have Samsung Fold and was sad to find it wasn't compatible. Only 20% of population has an Iphone. The receiver reminds me of a flip phone I had 10 years ago. Please update for MODERN Android phones.",
            "Another crappy app by dexcom with huge design flaws. It takes forever to produce a report and during that time if the app loses focus (if you switch to another app or if your screen turns off) the report production will cancel without warning and without informing you. So you have to wait several minutes while touching the screen every few seconds to make sure your screen doesn't turn off while the app does its thing. This is ridiculous.",
            "Yeah, it helps me to refine and schedule my meal changes, periods of activity, BG insulin corrections and my exercise program by showing BG pattern changes periodically throughout the previous day. Kudos for a reliable, well-considered app for helping the diabetic and his care team in dealing with the challenges of diabetes!",
            "Extremely helpful. A must needed tool to control and figure out best treatment, like what foods trigger my blood sugar. I keep a low sugar / carb diet. I have a difficult situation. I also take ani rejection meds steroids which cause my blood sugar to go up as well without this app I was always guessing now I know exactly how to control my issues when they're high which they are many times I'm able to correct due to my steroids"

I do not use a fitbit or smart watch at this time. Otherwise the app is top notch!",

            "This is a great app, but I wish that it would sync with the LOSEIT app like it does FITBIT and/or keep the food Input, it would save a lot of time. The coaching and information is GREAT.",
            "(8/12/20 Update) Since the update to ver 1.5 build 132.1780, is way harder to enter data. Used to be able to do insulin and meds at same time, now you have to do one, go out, select other and then enter its value. Also, you can no longer enter insulin values higher than 99. If you take higher, you have to make 2 separate entries. The previous version was just starting to work well, now we're back to a screwed up app again. Will be dropping and moving to something else.

            "This app/service is life changing! By taking daily metrics, dietary suggestions and specialized coaching, I've seen improvement in my health. My efforts in working with this app (and daily exercise/activities) has not only represented a change in diet but a change in lifestyle.",
            "So far I have been able to track my blood pressure and my blood sugar levels, and see the results. I'm trying to sync my phone with the app for the steps, but it isn't working. Apparently I didn't understand that I needed a watch or some other device that sticks with me and links to the phone. I thought that it I had my phone in my hand it would track my steps. Besides this one, the last 2 sentences are new, unless I get a iwatch or Fitbit, I can't sinc with the app.",
            "Extremely poor service and the app frequently fails to upload. When you say there is connectivity issues, you are told their map says you have service. It does not dawn on them it may be innaccurate for your specific location. There are difficulties in getting assistance. When one gets assistance, the file is not notated. I determined it is easier to use a traditional tester with Samsung health, than putz about with this flawed, time consuming app.",
            "For the most part, the app is ok. But I didn't do one challenge and for some unknown reason, I haven't received anymore challenges. I don't always remember to post what I eat and I don't like that I can't put the actual times myself. I definitely like that it records my weight, though not particularly happy with the scale and I enjoy the tips.",
            "The app and program was given to me at no charge by my insurance company and I feel like I still overpaid. The meter is 2 times the size of my accu check, the strips are huge and gives readings that it gives do not match my old meters or the one from my doctor (was over 20 points off with mutiple readings). If you are researching before signing up for the program dont waste your time."

            "Great tool for diabetics, helps to keep all blood logs in one place. Also the auto counting feature for insulin and carbs is a great. One of the top apps out there. Update 2020: Found a major flaw with the app, when trying to export logs there is no option to add to email as a PDF ect. Also when exporting to google drive for example the data is discombobulated and unusable. Hopefully this gets fixed soon because without an exporting function the app becomes useless, which is a shame.",
            "This app for recording BS, food intake, and insulin works great for me. Get the paid upgrade. It is well worth the money just for library of food carbs. The only thing I would like to see added is a simple operator\"s manual. The 'Help Section' is useful, but could be expanded.",
            "Jesus christ. This app auto selects part of your insulin and aims. If I took what this app suggests I would be dead! Not even close to being correct. A time when I can manually work out I need 18 units this all is telling me to take 32 units... uninstalled quickly.",

            "This app has most of the basic data needed. Most people eat/drink the same things over the course of a week (i.e., milk) If these food items could be copied to the saved area or tagged somehow for quick selection. The food database could also have a seeable field for the brand names of products.",
            "I've paid two times for this app. I went with this app for the easy use. The food data base sold me and it still doesn't work. It would be nice for some tech help to get this feature working.",
            "Best app I've found to help calculate bolus as well as corrections and track carb consumption. Just with there was a basal function.",
            "Revised--I don know what changed but I can no longer give this 5 stars. The daily, and thus 30 day average are now calculated incorrectly. Today for example I was 67, 167, and 119. Making the daily average 117. The app says after I put in the 119 that my daily went from 115 to 134.  This makes no sense and is incorrect. The 30 day on my meter is 112, same readings entered into the app and the app says 130. Very annoying. I'll be looking for a new app despite liking the other features.   I've been type 1 for 50 years now--this is the best program i have found so far--simple to use and only what's needed to help keep things in control.  Only wish it came combined  with a program like fit day that had food carb values so i only had to use one program.",
            "I highly recommend this app. It is by far the best app I've tried for man aging my diabetes. I now have:  • an extensive database of foods I      eat that are cutomised to featuring my key information  • the ability to easily work out how much insulin to bolus as the app calculations are customised to match my known sensitivity variations throughout the day  • a graph tracking my trends making it simple to see if I need to make any adjustments for improved management of my blood glucose.  I have been using this app for several months now and it does everything I need it to. As a result I can make informed decisions which have improved my overall diabetes management markedly."

I was able to open it this morning but then it crashed and won't open again. New fix coming soon again? I know there have been 2 recent updates.",
            "Was working great until the last update. Looks like the update went in on October 22nd and that's when it started not loading the app for me anyways. Ever since the update it just hangs in the loading screen it does not go into the app. I was on the beta channel but reading reviews it looks like it's affecting a lot of other people. My device is a Samsung Galaxy Note 9+.",
            "Update: I uninstalled and re-installed the App and it now opens up and syncs normally again. There was no option to update, only to uninstall and re-install. Previous Review: App Not Loading! I've checked for a few days now and the App won't open up beyond the initial blue screen. Please fix!",
            "Similar to others, the app has challenges with sync. It is odd........(update): I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. So far, it appears to be working. Will test it a few more times over the course of the next week and see what happens.",
            "I have the latest version 2.1.5 and the app simply won't open. I just get the blue \"pretend like I'm gonna open and then don't\" screen. Loved it before this last update."

            "Very quick and easy app to use. Very handy if you are watching sugar intake (diet, health, both). The free version shows the Glycemic Index of the food item, & it's all colour coded like traffic lights so very quick to scroll or search for the food you want - & see if it's a good choice! For those who want to eat a low-carb lifestyle and also watching the impact of carbs for health reasons, the app now includes the option to make a one time payment to see the Glycemic Load of food. I love it!",

            "Awesome app. I use this regularly to log my BG levels, meals, insulin and exercise.. whenever I use the Freestyle Libre Pro sensor, I can automatically link the Glimp app to synch results here. The reports, and the \"Follow\" feature are a huge plus. Blue Circle team periodically keeps adding many new features that I and other users have requested for which makes it all the more valuable. If you or your loved ones are living with Diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, LADA or any other), download the app now!",
            "Amazing app to manage diabetes! I am a t1 since 10 years and was always searching for a decent app to manage my sugar levels Now, i am able to share my blood sugar with family, Log my meals, exercise and sugar levels......And the best part is the reports i can generate in the app! This app has definately made my life simpler! :)",
            "My daughter is t1 since 2.5 years. usually she takes tresiba at 9:30 p.m. but yesterday we forgot to give her insulin. At 10:00 p.m. when I was updating the Bg and insulin dose in Bluecircle app, I suddenly remembered that she hasn't taken insulin so I immediately woke her up and gave her the insulin... I am very much thankful to this bluecircle team. This is really helpful for I get to know the average blood sugar of a single day and I can work on where I am lacking.",

It covers all the aspects that you would need- logging your blood sugars, insulin intake info, meal pictures, compatible with Glimp as well and generates reports that could be shared with your doctor."

            "I have the Diabetes & Diet Tracker, and it is very easy to use. I record all my food every day, and the app is very helpful for me personally. Weight loss is made more difficult when you have a ton of emotional baggage like I have. Having the facts - the actual numbers - in front of me helps me stay on track. I also must mention the scanner. It is wonderful!",
            "App works great. Fairly easy to learn and use. Would be 5 stars if it showed a total daily macros on a pie chart instead of a huge layout form that is very difficult to read and quite useless. Like the diabetes carb count, that is most useful to me. Would also like to know how to delete self created recipes but help section isn't very helpful and doesn't explain how. Love the huge database with many foods I use and happy with how easy and quick it is to add the odd new food that isn't there."

            "This is the 6th app I tried to help me monitor my prediabetes. Although it can be used to chat and share, I don't. It's easy to track blood glucose, exercise and (using the note feature/ choices) put in my meals. I'd like to be able to have the note categories labeled in charts to make it easier to review how my meals and exercise effect my glucose levels. It would also be helpful if note choices could be edited to add more choices when I forget one. Thanks, Dottli is wonderfully useful!",

There's no way to contact support within the game even though it says there is, and refunds aren't offered through Google Play. Edit: my purchase showed up about 20 minutes later. Pretty frustrating.",

With Dexcom G5 Mobile, dynamic glucose data can be accessed and shared safely and conveniently anywhere, anytime to your compatible smart device. \r\n* CGM-based treatment requires fingersticks for calibration; may result in hypoglycemia if calibration not performed or symptoms/expectations do not match CGM readings. \r\nThe Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  For example, you can set the schedule to match your work hours and have different alert settings during the rest of the day. Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts other than the Urgent Low Alarm.\r\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive CGM Alerts, including Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Alarm, and Rise and Fall Rate alerts. Always Sound is on by default.  A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, three alerts cannot be silenced:  Urgent Low Alarm, Transmitter Failure, and Sensor Failure. Please note that when Android phones are on the most restrictive Do Not Disturb setting (Total Silence), you will not receive any audible alerts/alarm, including the urgent low, transmitter failure, or sensor failure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the exceptional performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features: \r\n•\tIntuitive and user-friendly interface \r\n•\tDexcom SHARE® remote monitoring is built into the G5 app, allowing you to share your glucose data with up to five followers, who can remotely monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection. \r\n•\tS Health access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps \r\n•\tQuick Glance allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\r\n\r\nAndroid Wear Integration\r\n•\tActivate the Dexcom G5 Mobile watch face to quickly access your glucose information and trend graph right from your wrist\r\n•\tYou can view glucose alerts and alarms from your Android Wear watch\r\n\r\nThe Dexcom G5 Mobile Android App is compatible with select Android devices only.

            "Won't work with any new phones. I bought over 5000 dollars worth of sensors and can't use them with any new phones that I want because none are supported. Also the help desk was of absolutely no help and just continued to repeat themselves about fda regulations and paperwork that was no fault of dexcom... Wth, this is even an issue with newer I phones. I have no option as my receiver doesn't work and keeps cycling. Shame on you dexcom. I will be getting a different brand.",
            "Does not work with the Galaxy S20 5G. My s9+ broke and had to get a new phone. I'm stuck now. If you need a glucose monitor consider another brand if your an android user. Going to talk to my doc about switching after using Dexcom for years. I'm aware there are compatible devices but the list contains devices that are old. Manufacturers tend to update their products if you weren't aware of it Dexcom.",
            "Doesn't work with new Samsung Phones. I need you to upgrade the Dexcom g5 in order to read my blood sugar levels. I have a Samsung Galaxy S20 and I need my Dexcom 5 to work with it. 😊 Thanks.",
            "I just upgraded phones to a Motorola G8 + in April and the first app I went to download was this because I'm a 17 year old type 1 diabetic, and it's incompatible with this device along with all the other reviews on here and nothing is being done. I've requested calls on their website. Now I'm stuck using some old transmitter that needs to be charged every day. Putting peoples life in danger Dexcom...",
            "Life saving device/app! Unfortunately, there is an issue with alerts, which is the primary reason to use this app. The alert volume is effected by the media volume you have set. If you play games on your phone and turn down the media volume, you are turning down your alerts in the process. If you forget to turn the volume back up, you won't hear your alerts. This has happened to me several times at night and I have not heard my low alerts due to this issue. This needs to be changed."

            "I am SO HAPPY I found this app ! ! !  Since there's no Dexcom G5 app that I can load onto my archaic Moto Z2, I loaded the Simulator, the same way people would walk around in the 80s with a fake cell phone... they wanted to look cool.  Thank goodness I have this app loaded, at least now I won't look like an idiot when I'm having dinner or impressing the ladies at my local 'Cool Diabetics Only' club.  Brian, if you're still wondering what kind of moron has 2 thumbs and would put a simulator for his CGM on his phone....         This Guy  I mean seriously, a simulator is better than no app at all, isn't it ?",
            "my Dexcom G5 about a month ago my average was over 500 to 600 everyday Wade Slater I am down to average of 180. So far it's done everything that is supposed to do for me. I see a lot of bad reviews than must have got the bugs figured out I would highly recommended this to anybody that has a problem with highs or lows I just love the machine wanted Lifesaver for me. Thanks Dexcom for all of the help getting me started everybody that I've talked to seems really nice love dealing with you.",
            "All I wanted was to download the actual app so I could use my phone as well as the received to monitor my blood sugar. When it downloaded it was a tutorial only, so I decided to try it. To my surprise is wouldn't open. What does a person have to do to get the real app, have a Droid phone.",

            "App is painfully slow to load. Response time for a reading is completely unacceptable and for the price, there are competitors that can match the cost of test strips. Also, customer service is horrendous.",
            "This app, along with the Center Health Nano glucometer, is a game-changer for me! I've been using it for almost a month & I've learned so much about how different things (meals, medications, exercise, etc) affect my blood sugar. It's easy to use, inexpensive, & actually makes me enjoy getting my readings. I highly recommend it for anyone with diabetes.",
            "At first it seemed like a great idea, and the app while slow, worked great. My reading were accurate compared to other tests. The ISSUE is that I've tried MULTIPLE times to pause my subscription because I've got too many strips and they CONTINUE to charge me anyway. The app does not have a SEND button for messaging them so you are in good faith that your request got through!!",
            "Love the app, however. I have had to uninstall it 3 times in the po ast several months. I keeps locking up and tonight before I uninstalled the app it worked for 30 minutes without o po ening up. I have changed the battery 2 ti mb es I have an Android and it is a po ain to use this app. When it works it is great"

            "Ok, so I like the app, however please fix the email sending or find a better way for the sharing of logs - like maybe being able to save a PDF to our phones or devices and send as an attachment. The sharing / email option in the in the iHealth Glucose app is far far superior and the logs/report is much more detailed.   Also, do these reading not sync to my iHealth cloud account? I don't see ANY of my glucose testing in my cloud account since started using this app!  I travel extensively (40 weeks out of 52 a year) and I kind of rely on this to get my testing numbers and information to my endocrinologist.",

Now is the perfect time to start fresh and join the low carb revolution.<br><br>This update includes:<br>* Bug fixes and performance improvements",

            "I purchased the premium version only to find out it doesn't sync with my Samsung active 2 or samsung health It's a decent app to track your macros which I was doing fine in the free version. The app is confusing and requires a lot of extra input if you wanna use the premium features. The recipes are typically off on the macros. Also, there are often several options to choose an item to add, for ex \"egg\", and when you open it, it might be \"taco soup\". I regret purchasing the premium version.",
            "The app is simple and VERY helpful, especially if you are beginning your Keto journey like me. I love how the graphics help me monitor my progress. I've lost my first 5 lbs and I honestly feel this app has definitely supported me in doing this. I'm surprised I didn't quit using the app like I've done before with other apps. Give it a try. I'm SO GLAD I did :)",
            "This is absolutely a keto must have. I can't believe how good the food database is. I love that you can copy meals to multiple days and log your food diary for the week all in one shot on meal prep day! I noticed theres some kind of glitch scrolling through the values when you log a food. For example, when I indicate how many grams of avocado I'd like, sometimes the number value disappears if I scroll too fast and I need to go backward out of that food and back into it to make it work.",
            "This is the app you want to get if you are going to go on a keto diet. I liked it so much I bought the paid version. It has helped me lose 76 pounds and still losing weight. Would have given 5 stars but the app is painfully slow to load. To the Developers of this app. Please do something about how slow it is to load. I'll change my review if you can do this Cheers",
            "Love this tracker it is beyond easy and intuitive. Save recipes, copy anything to any day you want. Scan barcodes. Set up meal reminders and anything else you might need in a simple easy to read design. I \"WAS\" using 'my fitness pal' but seriously Carb Manager gives for free what MFP wanted me to pay $50 a year for.... CM is the best and I recommend it to everyone on keto or not because it's just that amazing to use & you DON'T need to pay!!"

        "description": "When you have diabetes, a primary goal is to keep it under control. Here are some simple things you can do each day to help achieve that goal.\r\n\r\nExercise\r\nRegular physical activity helps you feel better. It also improves your sensitivity to insulin, which means it works better in your body. Because it does, your blood sugar levels can become more stable.\r\n\r\nExercise can also help ease stress.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't active now, start slow. Then build up how much exercise you get over time. Shoot for 4 to 7 periods of activity each week. Try to make each period last for at least 30 minutes. And you don't have to work out at the gym to be active. Take the stairs instead of an elevator, or park at the far end of the lot. Both add exercise to your daily routine.\r\n\r\nHave a realistic goal and make a plan. What exercises will you do, and when will you do them? For example, you might plan to walk 30 minutes most days on your lunch break.\r\n\r\nChange your activities often enough so you don't get bored. You can do aerobic activities like walking or jogging. And resistance exercises like working out with weights offer another option. Whatever you do, don't forget to stretch before and after each workout session.\r\n\r\nIt's important to realize that exercise lowers your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to adjust your meds or insulin dose to keep your levels high enough.\r\n\r\nEat a Well-Balanced Diet\r\nHaving diabetes shouldn't keep you from enjoying a bunch of different foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to fill half your plate with non-starchy vegetables such as:\r\n\r\nAsparagus\r\nBroccoli\r\nCarrot\r\nCucumber\r\nSalad greens\r\nSquash\r\nTomato\r\nYou can also get protein from vegetarian things like tofu.\r\n\r\nStick to whole-grain foods. If you eat cereals, check the ingredients and make sure whole grain is first on the list.\r\n\r\nExamples of whole grains include:\r\n\r\nBrown rice\r\nBulgur (cracked wheat)\r\nReduce Stress\r\nIf you're stressed, you may exercise less, drink more, and not watch your diabetes as closely.\r\n\r\nStress can raise your blood sugar and make you less sensitive to insulin. When you're stressed, your body adopts a \"fight or flight\" response. That means it will make sure you have enough sugar and fat available for energy.\r\n\r\nStudies of people with type 1 diabetes found blood sugar levels go up for most people under mental stress and down for others. If you have type 2 diabetes and you're feeling pressure, your glucose will go up.",

Had a look at a few diabetic apps but this looks most usefully laid out with extra benefits so dont mind the subscription fee. Would be better if your free trial was longer, say 14-28 days to give us a chance to use the app in practice. That might also appease some of the bad reviewers",

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

A single man (or not) in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife (or something else) and a girl blessed with beauty should be with a gentleman with equal counterbalance. We are so ready to help you find that person. How about you?",

            "Undoubtedly, it is not the best of its kind, compares to seeking arrangement web version, but it suits me the best, and it is super easy to find new people around me, theres no bots, no ads etc. The best of all, if you go to a business trip, you can still find people there. Its a secret arrangement and no one will know anything about it.",
            "I paid for a monthly service 14.99 THEN bought 9.99 of coins. I did these things to unlock. Meanwhile I cant even send messages again when I could before. Cant put myself on the top of list when it says indont have coins. But I do. I bought them REFUND PLZ. I SPENT all that money and am still getting what ppl get that dont buy anything. It's like you guys are just acting like I didnt purchase. My purchases are not even showing up or allowing me to do the things it said it would. ReFunD Plz.",
            "one of reasons I rate this hookup app full stars is It allows you to initiate instant contact after signing up, and the connections are almost free of charge. I totally understand that you need money to keep your company work. So I paid the service. As a paid user, I am quite satisfied with your service and as a sugar baby, I found what I am here for and that;s enoug for me.",
            "Money making scam. Charges for messages and real interaction. Basic 'like' and match feature is available for free...but is pointless. After signing up and committing money to chase better result, I was utterly disappointed, no more confident in the users, appear to be just scams or robots and complete waste of time. Would be zero stars if possible.",
            "Loved it! Had some real nice hookup with several sugar baby found here. They would recommend you pretty sugar baby from all over the world, because for most sugar daddy, distance is really not an issue. I love travel and I would be willing to travel a far distance if I like someone. Besides, with long distance, it would guarantee a secret arrangement. So personally, I prefer to go to hookup with a sugar baby far away. It gives me a sense of security like a holiday."

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

Learn everything and you will find tips and knowledge to keep you from diabetes.\r\n\r\nOur blood glucose level, or blood sugar level, is the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. The amount of glucose in the blood is measured in millimoles per litre (mmol/l). Glucose levels are measured most commonly to diagnose or to monitor diabetes. It is also important to keep an eye on blood glucose levels during certain situations – for example: during pregnancy, pancreatitis and with increasing age. Normally, blood sugar levels stay within a narrow range during the day. A good level is between 4 to 8mmol/l. After you consume food, your blood sugar level will rise and after you have had a night’s rest, they will usually be lowest in the morning.\r\n\r\nDiabetes is a common disease in our society, affecting 2-5% of the general population, with many more people unaware that they may be affected by this condition. Diabetes results from a lack of insulin, or insensitivity of the body towards the level of insulin present. Thus if you have diabetes, your blood sugar level may move outside the normal limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this app, we will disscuss the following topics:\r\n\r\n• Know Your Blood Sugar Level - 5 Best Reasons Why This Is So Important For A Diabetic\r\n• 5 Tips to Lower Blood Sugar Level\r\n• Blood Sugar Level Control - 3 Strategies For Once A Day Checking Of Your Blood Sugars\r\n• Normal Blood Sugar Levels for Adults With Diabetes\r\n• High Blood Sugar, Diabetes, and Your Body\r\n• 16 Tips for Controlling Blood Sugar\r\n• Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia)\r\n• Blood Glucose Control (Blood Sugar Levels)\r\n• Blood Sugar Levels - 11 Cheap Ways to Lower Blood Sugar Levels Naturally\r\n• 8 Sneaky Things That Raise Your Blood Sugar Levels\r\n\r\nAnd much more..\r\n\r\n\r\n[ Features ]\r\n\r\n- Easy & simple guide book app\r\n- Periodic update of contents\r\n- Support Offline Database \r\n- Shareable contents\r\n- You can ask questions from our experts\r\n- Send us your suggestions and we will add it\r\n\r\n\r\nA little words about Blood Sugar Levels:\r\n\r\nThe blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration, or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose present in the blood of humans and other animals. Glucose is a simple sugar and approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of a 70-kilogram (150 lb) human at all times. The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis. Glucose is stored in skeletal muscle and liver cells in the form of glycogen; in fasted individuals, blood glucose is maintained at a constant level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle.\r\n\r\nIn humans, glucose is the primary source of energy, and is critical for normal function, in a number of tissues, particularly the human brain which consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals. Glucose can be transported from the intestines or liver to other tissues in the body via the bloodstream. Cellular glucose uptake is primarily regulated by insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas.\r\n\r\nGlucose levels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day, and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few millimoles. Blood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition. A persistently high level is referred to as hyperglycemia; low levels are referred to as hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes, and is the most prominent disease related to failure of blood sugar regulation. There are different methods of testing and measuring blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\nThe intake of alcohol causes an initial surge in blood sugar, and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also, certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload Blood Sugar Levels app now to read more..",

I just want to enter custom amount of sugar, \nI don't need the list of all those brands that are not even present in my \ncountry. I worked this around by creating my custom product \"Sugar \nTeaspoon\" with \"Teaspoon\" brand and random category, but it's stupid. I \nhope you guys still work on improving this. Good luck!"

But, off-course you have to read nutrition labels, weigh your meals and do some maths. Because my wife has fallen sick with type 1 diabetes, after visits to diabetic educators, I decided to write for her simple program where she can create database of foods she eats, and which will do carbohydrates counting for her. I used desktop database application and put it on her laptop.After about 3 years of her using software religiously before every meal, somebody asked me if I could write application version of program for  smartphone. This applications does not create fancy reports, sends emails to your doctor, reads world foods database or scans bar codes on packaging. My wife doesn't need it. Her  glucose meter and its software takes care of all diabetic statistics, and it's not big deal to send email with reports it creates to her doctor, she does it every fortnight. She wants to create database of carbohydrates content of foods she actually eats, either ready food or self-prepared meals. Use it to compile her meal and let application to calculate carbohydrates content. Then measure glucose level and get suggested insulin dose based on her meal carbo content and blood glucose level.\r\nToo complex apps only create confusion, especially among older people.",

The rate the app question is very premature. I read some of the complaints on here about this very same issue. thought it was trivial, but then it happened to me. I shouldn't be forced to rate your app. Just like you can't force people to buy or use services.",

This diet is going to help me reach my goal of getting better blood sugars and lose some unwanted weight. I have tryed pretty much ever diet out there but this one is going to be my saving grace.",

Also what you should eat once every day and how much. From a selection of foods. it explains about the portion sizes. The diabetic nurse just sent myself off with a booklet.
