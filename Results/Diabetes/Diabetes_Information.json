            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",

        "description": "Diabetic cooking doesn't have to be a challenge. These recipes make it easy to whip up delicious, healthy, diabetic-friendly meals. For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.\r\n\r\nLosing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you’ve already developed diabetes, it’s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.\r\n\r\nNutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range. To manage your blood glucose, you need to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if you take any. What you choose to eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are all important in keeping your blood glucose level in the range that your health care team recommends.\r\n\r\nDIABETIC RECIPES APP EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nThis is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app.\r\nAs the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you’re cooking.\r\n\r\nTheme Support\r\n\r\nProtect your eyes from being hurt by a bright screen at night by enabling dark mode.\r\nMake your diabetic recipes cooking experience more comfortable at night.\r\n\r\nSmart Shopping List for Your Diet Control\r\n\r\nAn organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won’t miss any for the recipe.

The problem appears to be that the app can only manage around about a year of data. Restricting the time frame in the filter to just under a year sorts it out.",

            "I can't think of any features not already included. The bolus advisor was invaluable in helping me resolve highs and lows. A1c dropped from 7.0 to 6.0 in 2 months. I created a Notes category and use the filter to see only my Notes. I upgraded to Premium, but the free version includes plenty of bells & whistles. I highly recommend this app! Don't know how I managed without it! Bonus: I can print reports directly from Samsung phone to Samsung printer using Samsung print app.",
            "I have been using this after using Glooko for several years. it is more complex and send to have more features. I switched because it will read my Libre Freestyle sensor directly. The Fitbit integration is not reliable; it is not picking up my weight. MyFitnessPal does a much better job of tracking nutrition. This app should just give up on nutrition teaching and instead integrate with MyFitnessPal. Overall I really like it; I have become a Premium subscriber.",
            "Pulls the wrong numbers from both glucometer and CGM. Using libre cgm and the libre link app will pull a completely different number from this app. When I check with a blood glucose reading, it shows the libre link to be the accurate one (as expected). Also when we use the glucometer, the app always imports a different number from the meter reading. I.e. meter will say 5.6 mmol & the app will record reading of 5.4 Food database is also finicky. Customer service completely ignores me every time.",
            "I do love this app And would use it for all of my diabetic care however I use a Libre2 monitoring system which is not supported by this app. This is not necessarily the fault of this app however is a fault of the libre system for not allowing the monitoring. If you have a libre2 or a 14 day don't bother it will not work",
            "This is a great app!! I showed it to my Doctor on my last visit and he was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with it!! He like it even more when I told him that it connected with my meter!! He noticed the estimated A1C, and later when he got my lab reports back, he made a point to tell me that my level was just as this app had estimated it to be!! Had another visit with this same Dr. on 8/5/20(MASK ON!). To emphasize how impressed he is with this app, he requested to see my latest results from this app!! 👍🏽"

            "Pretty useful app, I like the way everything is organized, presenting the statistics is easy and intuitive. There is Bluetooth compatibility with my glucometer and that makes is really easy to pass my measurements to the app. The user interface is easy and the app is polished in general. Good job.",
            "Almost perfect app for diabetic users. Over all this is a very good program to keep track of your blood sugar, BP, weight, etc... Works fine on Android 8 and 9 with Huawei Mate 10 Pro and Mate 20 Pro. The only problem which I found on Android 9 pie is that fordiabetes Continuously scans for Bluetooth in background.Looks like when you exit app app stay opened in background. Sometimes app don't sync with my Contour Next One no matter that I try also manually to sync my reading on Contour. But most important for me is they have great support. You send mail to support team and you receive answer almost immediately no matter is the working day or not. The best support I seen over last years. On Progress page you can see Weekly and Monthly Average but not Yearly or at least 3 month Average which is important for HbA1c. Statistic can be better. Today the most important things are statistical data. From those data we can see our progress.  Till today I tried many diabetes app but this one is almost perfect. Keep going on this way, you do very good job. Sorry for my English. It is not so perfect like your app.",
            "The app helped me track down my measurements corellated to my diabetes. Really helpfull seeing my progress since downloading the app",
            "Really helped me balance my blood sugar levels. Pretty useful app.",
            "Overall a smooth good looking app. However it's disappointing the Google sync is to sync activities instead of also syncing blood pressure or glucose via custom data type."

            "Great app! I've used several diabetes trackers and this is the best, for average use. It allows you to track the important stuff your doctors ask for and provides exports of data, but it's simple to use and not too complicated to set up. I paid the $1.99 U.S. to upgrade to the Pro version with no ads. It's well worth that fee. ***IDEA FOR THE DEVELOPER*** I like the Measured drop list where I can select a description for each blood test, such as \"fasting\" or \"after breakfast.\" Would you mind expanding that just a little to match what doctors in the U.S. ask for? Here's what I'm thinking: (1) CHANGE the three existing \"Before\" meal options to say \"Immediately before.\" Example: \"Before breakfast\" would become \"Immediately before breakfast.\" (2) ADD three meal options that begin with \"2 hours before.\" Example: \"2 hours before breakfast.\" ***MORE IDEAS FOR DEVELOPER:*** (3) Allow me to set an automatic recurring backup to a cloud drive location of my choice, such as a Google Drive folder. (4) Provide the option of a web interface with quick data entry and data exports. I work on a computer all day so it would be faster for me to type my data into a bookmarked browser page than use my phone. I would only use my phone when I'm away from my computer. (5) You could add some \"about this app\" info inside the app. It might include the official name of the app, links to a web interface, company info, company email, developer info, links to review the app on Play Store, etc. Thanks for considering my ideas and thanks for making a great, stable app that is easy to use and understand!",
            "Great app. Easy to use for recording blood sugar and blood pressure levels and the report feature allows you to easily share your data with your doctor. The ads can be annoying, but for a free app that works well that is only a minor issue.",
            "Looks pretty good. Only thing I would suggest for an upgrade. With the blood pressure it is set on the right arm and it is necessary to change it every time for my left arm. It would be good if there was something in settings to be able to set it to the left arm permanently. Not only for us right-handed people. The bloke at the chemist where I bought my blood pressure device said that it is better to use the left arm. Something to do with the circulatory system.",
            "Excellent app. It helps remind me to watch what I eat. I can see the cause and effect of my choices. So this hells me stay on track. I love the \"Statistics\" data and the fact I can express the data to PDF for my doctor. I highly recommend this app 👍",
            "Great application. Just one thing is missing that there should be combined report chart of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight."

            "I have not had a chance to use this app but 1 time and I mean only flipped through a couple of screens, and suddenly trying to back out of a screen Im asked to rate the app before I can exit out. The rate the app question is very premature. I read some of the complaints on here about this very same issue. thought it was trivial, but then it happened to me. I shouldn't be forced to rate your app. Just like you can't force people to buy or use services.",
            "I am a type 1 Diabetic on an insulin pump and I need to lose some weight and get my blood sugars better under control. my A1C is 6.9 right now and that has been the highest I have ever been and I am not happy with that number. This diet is going to help me reach my goal of getting better blood sugars and lose some unwanted weight. I have tryed pretty much ever diet out there but this one is going to be my saving grace.",
            "This app is looking for feedback before you even get a chance to go through the various modules. Gave it a 3 but i really won't know for a while.",
            "As I've just been told im type 2 insulin dependant diabetic. I've found this app more informative than all the others. It tells you what you can/can't eat. Also what you should eat once every day and how much. From a selection of foods. it explains about the portion sizes. The diabetic nurse just sent myself off with a booklet. To be honest its made my outlook a bit better now"

            "It is mostly convenient to enter data, but I'd like the ability to change the defaults in Settings. For instance, my smart watch measures blood pressure on my left wrist, but the default is \"right arm\". For another, the readings I take in the morning up to early afternoon are all 'Fasting', but the app tries to be helpful by suggesting an event label based on an average person's schedule.",
            "I am pre diabetic and need to regularly measure my blood sugar. I love being able to log my numbers in without having to go through a tedious menu. Its also got an alarm I can pgm to remind myself to do it. Oh, and itll show me if my numbers are \"normal\" or \"too high\". I am sure it must have a \"too low\" category, but my numbers are never that low.",
            "Very easy to use, that's main need. Can be exported but I'd prefer it to be able to be saved or backed up to my Dropbox acct. Notes aspect is confusing since it's not actually separate from the actual things you're tracking. That should be a note feature that doesn't get attached to anything. Also the food is only in grams which I'm not going to use. I will be trying other apps, but if my few needs here we're there, I'd have picked my app by now.",
            "Nice clean interface on a basic record keeping app for diabetics. Not a lot of bells and whistles. I use it for my cat's glucose and insulin. I particularly like the quick entry option by pressing + at the main menu to add a reading. It could use some improvement in terms of managing the list of medications, though. We only use one, but I still have to select it from the list each time. There's probably a file I can edit or something, but it's not spelled out anywhere I've seen.",
            "I've used this app for a number of years now. It is a great way for me to keep a record for my doctors as well as myself. Thank you! At this point, however two-years following my last review, I am a bit frustated. Again I am attempting to share my numbers with my doctor. But this time the app does not provide the BP readings for print or any other modes of transmitting; only blood glucose. I am disappointed right now!"

Had a look at a few diabetic apps but this looks most usefully laid out with extra benefits so dont mind the subscription fee. Would be better if your free trial was longer, say 14-28 days to give us a chance to use the app in practice. That might also appease some of the bad reviewers",

            "What an amazing community! Highly recommended for Type 1's that want to surround themselves with good people for support and fun. The app could definitely use some more tweaking to make it snappier as it can lag a little bit on my Galaxy Note 10+, but it's pretty good for what it is used for. Think of it as a Facebook for Type 1 Diabetics. I would like the option to add multiple photos and have it show up as a grid like FB/Insta in posts. Maybe more reactions to posts?",

Come on programmers. Time to fix your mistakes!!!!",

I used the password to log in to the website but it the app won't accept it. Okay I leaned that website is not connected to the app. Customer service helped me change the app password and it works great again.",

All in all, it's not a bad App and can only improve as more recipes are added. Thank you.",

I love using this app. The only issue I have is continuous pricking which pai bs at the end of day.

            "Writing this review after using the app over 18 months now. I even took subscription and extremely happy with the decision I made. There are minor glitches in app sometimes, but support team is very good to resolve issues as soon as possible. Special mention to: Shrija and Devender for that quick support when I encountered issue with app.",

Update not possible due to above reason.& hence can't take advantage of updated APPs. Please do something so that your Apps can be updated without deleting any existing apps. 19/10/2020. Very good App. It helps in controlling blood sugar levels. Dr.'s follow up is also appreciable in critical condition. Thanks a lot .",
            "After one year the glucometer stopped working. On complaint the company said to buy a new meter. On purchase it worked only once. Then it stopped working. Now there is no meter to monitor my blood sugar. Two different smart phones I have tried and of no use.",
            "Very helpful app for monitoring the blood sugar levels. The facility is that i dont need to go to the Lab, where the blood test charges are high and also risk of infection is very high. This is more economic and cost effective."

I get this when trying any of the 3 methods shown so I can't even try out the app at all. After a couple of hours I retried the login and it worked. I have used it quite a bit since then and it works well. I really like it now. I have to say I'm really impressed with how quickly the developers acted on wanting to help me solve the problem. Excellent.",

This app has many recipes that you can actually enjoy while watching carbs, sugars and diet!

        "description": "Pets with diabetes can be treated very well resulting in a good quality of life. The best results are achieved when you as a pet owner record all things that are important indicators of success or failure. The diabetes management can be fine-tuned on the basis of these, avoiding complications associated with low and high blood sugars, as well as the costs associated with such complications.\r\n\r\nThis free app was designed by pet diabetes expert Dr Stijn Niessen of the Royal Veterinary College, University of London, UK. He designed the app for two main reasons: \r\n\r\n1. To provide diabetic pet owners with a convenient free tool to actively participate in the medical management of their beloved pet; \r\n\r\n2. To enable the gathering of strictly anonymous data on diabetic pets and their management. This enables diabetic pet owners to actively participate in research and help develop better treatment options for pets with diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe Diabetes Log feature of the app allows users to record, and easily share with their veterinarian, all those parameters that are essential to keep an eye on when it comes to pet diabetes management; they include: clinical signs like weight, appetite, thirst and urination changes, as well as urine and blood sugar values (for those owners who perform home blood or urine glucose testing).\r\n\r\nThe app also features the following:\r\n• a medication reminder function\r\n• a reminder to change the insulin injection sites (avoiding inflammation of areas too frequently used)\r\n• a scientifically validated tool which calculates and monitors quality of life\r\n• a scientifically validated tool to score your pet’s clinical signs\r\n• a tool to calculate the number of calories your diabetic pet likely needs\r\n• a tool to calculate the exact amount of food your diabetic pet likely needs\r\n• plenty of space to enter and keep save useful information (e.g. contact details of your veterinarian, important medical history, questions for your veterinarian, etc.)\r\n• visualisation of trends (using graphs), including changes in thirst, weight, fructosamine, average blood sugar values, urine ketones or sugar values, etc.\r\n• links to useful pet diabetes videos\r\n• an easy “export” function enabling the sharing of entered information and graphs with anyone interested, including your veterinarian.  \r\n\r\nSo, take control of your pet’s diabetes and start logging entries into the Diabetes Log. This will maximise your chances to achieve the best possible result, together with your veterinarian.

            "If the developer would debug this app it would have great potential. I gave it four stars because I like the concept and would have given at 5 if they fixed the bugs. Like others have said the day of the week is off by a day. If you log something in error there is no way to correct it or delete one entry. Typing on a small keyboard on one's cell phone, it is fairly easy to make typos. Example. If you enter an incorrect number of a glucose reading into the log the only way to fix it is to delete the entire log for that day, and rekey EVERYTHING which means you're deleting anything and everything that you have entered for that day. Then you have to start over. How stupid is that? There does not appear to be a method to enter a log with a previous date. If I am doing a glucose curve on my dog, I don't go to my phone to update the app 10 different times a day. I want to enter it all at once when time allows. I may not get to that for a day or two and in that case I need to be able to create a log that has a past date. Other enhancements that would be good 1. Automatically populate the type of insulin and dose by carrying-forward from the last entry, but also allow it to be edited. Most dogs are on the same insulin type and dose day after day. 2. same description as number 1 above, however relating to the food quantity. Again most diabetic dogs eat the same amount and type of food day after day. I don't want to have to enter that every day. It should carry forward.",
            "Right this is a really helpful app, however the one most annoying problem which is why you don't get full five stars is the monitoring tab and date. For some reason when you input a date the app defaults to the current date and then won't accept changing that date to another day. I wanted to input previous readings but it's not allowing me to do that. I would add screenshots but I don't know how. The interface is good but could be a little more fluid in it's design. Also I've tried this on two separate devices and the 01.10.2018 won't allow me to save as a valid date. No matter what it claims its an invalid date.",
            "Excellent tool to monitor, record data and export as PDF documents. The app is certainly comprehensive but easy enough to navigate after \"looking around\" on it for a while. One comment I'd add - it could do with a mention (in the \"About the app\" section) of how to delete an incorrect log entry. I finally discovered how, by accident - \"swipe left\" on the saved entry, & click on the red \"X\" that appears. I recommend the app to anyone who has a pet with diabetes.",
            "Such a great app, my dog has diabetes so keeping a log has made life so much easier especially as I have short term memory loss. Ideal for when you have to do your glucose curve at home and the ability to send the graph directly to your vet is great",
            "I just started using this app to track my dogs diabetes and i love it. The only downside is that whenever I make a new diary entry the day is always stuck on the day I started using the app and wont save the date when I change it."

            "Just received the unit from Dr. So far unable to pair it with phone. The phone sees it and will pair, but the meter will not reciprocate. It's stuck looking for the phone. The meter stays on 'enter pin number' until it shuts down. Also, the manual talks about using a calibration solution, which was not included. Rapidly losing confidence in the thing. I mean if they didn't bother to ensure the paring works, nor did they provide for its calibration. I'm beginning to wonder what the point is.",
            "Glitchy app, it gives me false readings or doesn't even sync to my phone and i have to manually input my readings. I've used 2 different meters, side by side and both gave my totally different readings this app being the worst. I tested twice within a 15 min time span before breakfast, my other unnamed meter gave me semi the same readings around the same mg/dL but Accu-chek readings both were different the first one was 131 and the other was 106 not 15 minutes later during my fasting.",
            "I'm reading some of the reviews and I'm having similar problems. When it downloads I love the layout the information is easy to review and I wish it did a better job of showing you more than 7 days. The problem is, like others, it's not wanting to forward the information to my phone. It's an ongoing problem I generally work around and reconnect. Now it's been a week of not reconnecting. I've done troubleshooting that's corrected it before and really need to be able to review my numbers.",
            "Easy to use app once connected. The only problem was getting it to actually pair with my device. My phone had no problem seeing and connecting to the meter but when I tried to do it within the app it kept failing. After many tries I finally closed everything and gave up. Came back a short time later and tried again then it magically worked. It's only been a couple days but the info seems to be sent to my phone app seamlessly now. Fingers crossed it keeps working.",
            "The Bluetooth connection has suddenly stopped working. I have restarted the app, repaired the meter with my phone, but to no avail. I set up an online account and never got the confirmation email. UPDATE 8/27/20. I found that the data transfer works if I open the app before taking the reading. Otherwise, seems to be working OK."

The reports, and the \"Follow\" feature are a huge plus. Blue Circle team periodically keeps adding many new features that I and other users have requested for which makes it all the more valuable. If you or your loved ones are living with Diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, LADA or any other), download the app now!",
            "Amazing app to manage diabetes! I am a t1 since 10 years and was always searching for a decent app to manage my sugar levels Now, i am able to share my blood sugar with family, Log my meals, exercise and sugar levels......And the best part is the reports i can generate in the app! This app has definately made my life simpler! :)",
            "My daughter is t1 since 2.5 years. usually she takes tresiba at 9:30 p.m. but yesterday we forgot to give her insulin. At 10:00 p.m. when I was updating the Bg and insulin dose in Bluecircle app, I suddenly remembered that she hasn't taken insulin so I immediately woke her up and gave her the insulin... I am very much thankful to this bluecircle team. This is really helpful for I get to know the average blood sugar of a single day and I can work on where I am lacking.",

Now they both cancel out the sensors even when the sensors don't need to be canceled out, like having multiple low readings in a row will cancel out a sensor even though they're accurate valid readings!",

Lots of logbook variables to track meals, carbs, trends, averages, etc. I'm sold! Libra Freestyle. Not as accurate as Dexcim G6 for low bs and high bs, per objective reviewers, but very cost effective. Knowing my BS at anytime helps me to dose more efficiently then doing based on a few random fingersticks several times a day.",

Push as hard as u can at 1st contact & make sure you don't sweat for the next hour (; wait 1 hour before working out ;)",

The norm was ten and I have had at least four of the last shipment died upon placing them on my arm! Oh, and it usually reads 100 plus or minus my hand held meter. Now that I think about it, I'd take away one of my stars, if it would let me!"

I think it's a great idea to educate people about the much underrated topic of diabetes with the help of a free app. As a doctor I have seen many patients who didn't even know they had diabetes. Furthermore, they were not aware of the consequences of diabetes such as increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, polyneuropathy, diabetic foot syndrome etc. This app will help so many people and provide them with important medical information. Great app!",

            "I like this app, it is fairly simple to use and the analysis tools are easy to understand. (I'm a Type 2 who doesn't take meds or insulin..)  However there is a drawback, the app is set up so you can only input values before & after each meal. It does NOT allow for more frequent testing .There is no way to input additional readings.   Today I tested to see  if I peak  2 hrs after a meal or if my blood glucose peaks earlier or later. I tested, 1 hour after a meal, 2 hours after & 3 hours after. There is no way of entering these additional readings into this app (unlike other apps.) I know other people with diabetes who test at bedtime & during the night because they have dawn phenomena (a rise on waking) Some Type 2s test for low blood sugar if they suspect a medication is lowering their blood sugar too much. . As well, Type 1 diabetics often test before exercise, if they suspect hypoglycemia & before driving (driving too low a glucose level is dangerous.)  Therefore I cannot recommend this app for any Type 1s. For Type 2s, I'd only recommend it for those who don't take any meds (other than metformin) or insulin."

Without the capacity to make adequate amounts of insulin, the body is not able to metabolize blood glucose (sugar), to use it efficiently for energy, and toxic acids (called ketoacids) build up in the body. There is a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe disease tends to occur in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood (before age 30) but it may have its clinical onset at any age. The symptoms and signs of type 1 diabetes characteristically appear abruptly, although the damage to the beta cells may begin much earlier and progress slowly and silently.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and signs include a great thirst, hunger, a need to urinate often, and loss of weight. Among the risks of the disease are serious complications, among them blindness, kidney failure, extensive nerve damage, and accelerated atherosclerosis. The long-term aim with treatment is to avoid these complications or, at the least, to slow their progression. There is no known cure.\r\n\r\nTo treat the disease, the person must inject insulin, follow a diet plan, exercise adequately (ideally, daily), and test their blood glucose several times a day.\r\n\r\nThis type of diabetes used to be known as \"juvenile diabetes,\" \"juvenile-onset diabetes,\" and \"ketosis-prone diabetes.\" It is now called type 1 diabetes mellitus or insulin-dependent diabetes.\r\n\r\nDon't be too alarmed with the aid of those questions, your medical doctor isn’t prying.

        "description": "Diabetes, type 1: An autoimmune disease that occurs when T cells attack and destroy most of the beta cells in the pancreas that are needed to produce insulin, so that the pancreas makes too little insulin (or no insulin). Without the capacity to make adequate amounts of insulin, the body is not able to metabolize blood glucose (sugar), to use it efficiently for energy, and toxic acids (called ketoacids) build up in the body. There is a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe disease tends to occur in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood (before age 30) but it may have its clinical onset at any age. The symptoms and signs of type 1 diabetes characteristically appear abruptly, although the damage to the beta cells may begin much earlier and progress slowly and silently.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and signs include a great thirst, hunger, a need to urinate often, and loss of weight. Among the risks of the disease are serious complications, among them blindness, kidney failure, extensive nerve damage, and accelerated atherosclerosis. The long-term aim with treatment is to avoid these complications or, at the least, to slow their progression. There is no known cure.\r\n\r\nTo treat the disease, the person must inject insulin, follow a diet plan, exercise adequately (ideally, daily), and test their blood glucose several times a day.\r\n\r\nThis type of diabetes used to be known as \"juvenile diabetes,\" \"juvenile-onset diabetes,\" and \"ketosis-prone diabetes.\" It is now called type 1 diabetes mellitus or insulin-dependent diabetes.\r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\n1.

It clearly highlights when they are too high and it's so confidential l convenient that you can share with a clinic. I don't have to worry about writing down my results and bringing them in for visits!",

I have seen better results in my A1C levels when I get checked by my doctor every three months! I recommend this app for others who may not have this valuable information to keep their health in good shape! Last A1C was 5.7 !!",
            "Worse app and even the meter looks like a very cheap toy. I have an accu-chek that is way better but it drains battery like crazy Onetouch doesn't always synchronize and when it does it takes few tries. The replies from their reviews is a joke. Same message for everyone having difficulties. I guess some companies get a pass with terrible products like this one and end up getting big market for this garbage.",
            "Just purchased, just starting monitoring, down loaded app and turned meter on and synced. I wasn't sure what I was doing and took couple tries but synced once I followed directions. I am using Galaxy A70. Once I start using app with readings, I will update this . Update I have been using the app for about a month. I found if I open app then minimize it, then press OK on monitor as it is booting up, tap app to open it. Both will sync. Give it a few seconds. I upgraded to 4 stars...",
            "Using it for about 15 months. Easy to use. Clearly shows glucose trends. Companion website makes it easy to produce reports for the doctor to review. Ability to record activity and carbohydrates consumed provides the doctor additional information relating to glucose numbers."

But it's very hard to find food history to see how to adjust dosing. Food items in the database do odd things when you change serving sizes. Syncing is largely unreliable and often comes a couple of days late. With all of Insulet's money behind this app, I'd expect it to be lots better.",

I would love to see search bar in Favorites tab in selecting food too. Now it's a bit hard to navigate through if I have 30+ favourites, for example. And can we input carbs per piece too, not only per 100g? How to remove or edit my public food notes? Thanks for all the effort you are putting in development of this ultimate diabetes solution!",
            "\"Login failed ExpoAppAuth.Get Auth: Network error\" Edit: from the screenshots, your app is little more than an excel spreadsheet with a few graphs, it is pretty but what does it need internet access for? What if I need to use it in airplane mode, like I tried to do? Will it just not work?",

Key elements are fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In fact, a diabetes diet is the best eating plan for most everyone.\r\n\r\nIf you have diabetes or prediabetes, your doctor will likely recommend that you see a dietitian to help you develop a healthy eating plan.

If you need to lose weight, a diabetes diet provides a well-organized, nutritious way to reach your goal safely.\r\n\r\nA diabetes diet is based on eating three meals a day at regular times.

            "I like how the app allows me to take notes such as the food I ate or if I did exercise for that day it's also good to know when I ate weather it's before or after a meal. I also like how if I forgot to input my blood sugar I can actually go back and put the actual time and date. This app is very easy and self-explanatory",
            "This is a no-frills app. If you're not a tech savvy person this is a good app for you; very simple to use. There are more complex apps that include other health logs, like BP, weight, medications, and diet & exercise logs but it seems many are designed primarily for type I diabetes and they are tedious to use. If you just want a simple app to track your reads, this one does it nicely.",
            "I totally love this app so easy to use and records information of what you have eaten it also does a graph and you can print out the information too. This app is the best one I have found and I love it and no adds and no hidden costs either. You can just use this app as it is so easy. I love it",
            "Excellent App! Does everything that I want it too! Simple to use. Intuitive! Looked at many other Apps that do the same thing, chose this App and glad that I did! Helps me manage my Diabetes day to day, and long term. Is very worth the small fee for the Premium version. I definitely give this App five stars.",
            "No frills log. Just wanted to be able to record my sugar levels not all the other garbage! Just recently diagnosed and with all the changes I am making to manage my diabetes I need simple when it came to logging my levels, without having to always find my paper log. This is the app for me!"

The app has an active developer who was very open to suggestions, many of which came with the regular updates. It was good when I first started using it, it is great now with the steady improvements with all my data still accessible from the time I started, giving me a permanent record of all my home measurements.",

I blame this on being stuck at home 24/7 because of covid. I was taking 60 units a day. Dropped it to 30 units and now none. So i tried at least a dozen apps. This one fits what i need. Plain and simple, easy to use. Thank you.",

Thank you for making this excellent app available and thank you for your work and effort in creating it. Very grateful🙏",

I continued to use it and my latest 90 day reading was 6.1..I went on 5/15/20 to get a reading and it was 7.8. I record several times a day so I'm not understanding the inaccuracy. I'm very disappointed and will most likely uninstall this app and find another more accurate app.",

            "Doesn't work at all. Keyboard doesn't pop up when I try add reading. I have Uninstalled several times still nothing.",
            "Helpful app - until I upgraded from the S8 to the S10 (Pie}. Now I have no menu within the app to access its other features. It's a great app, but I could use some help accessing my log and 30, 90 day averages. Update: I just discovered that the menu is still there, it's just \"hidden\". When I tap the top left corner of the app, it opens the menu. Even though, on my version, there is no menu icon visible. I'm back!"

            "I love the InPen. I have 2 pens and both paired beautifully and work extremely well with the app. I did love the app until the last update.Having issues with long acting insulin and other reminders as they just very randomly appear. I wish the app paired my Freestyle CGM. It would be so beneficial and much more efficient to have have my readings come directly from CGM as I often forget to record my glucose levels. Otherwise I love the ease of operation.",
            "I really like this app a lot because it helps me keep track of my dosages however it's always always ALWAYS important to double check and verify because there are times when the inpen will malfunction and will not register your dose at all or will register it incorrectly. Maybe I got a bad pen I'm not sure but please be careful and double-check that the app has added your dosages correctly upon dosing! Also the colors inside the app are nauseating to me like the inside of a yogurt shop yuck.",
            "Have to keep trying to pair an InPen several times before it will pair. Your account can only be logged in to one device at a time. An InPen can only paired to one device at a time.",
            "The perfect app for non-pumpers that like the features of a pump! We stopped pumping, and I really missed the ease of inputting info, and the dose being calculated. This app does everything! You set the therapy settings such as insulin to carb ratio and correction ratio. Then you simply input the carbs and/or blood sugar, and it calculates the dose you should give. It also keeps track of insulin on board so you don't stack doses! Using the InPen, everything is automated.",
            "Excellent app, the insulin calculator is the reason I got the inpen. I must enter my doses manually (bluetooth ON on my phone interferes with catching wifi), and the phone isn't compatible with dexcom to manually feed my BGs into the app. That severely limits the ease of the app, but dose calculator is king. My real complaint is with the update, both the HOME and LOGBOOK tabs look very similar now. I preferred the half-circle home screen which showed IOB prominently. Please make it more prominen"

            "It's easy to enter and edit glucose and bp readings in this app, but it is disappointing in terms of reporting the data. The Share with Doctor option creates a 'Comprehensive Report' including all entries for each date but with the dates completely jumbled up, which makes the report basically useless 😕",
            "I just started using this app. I like it but the buttons on the top are out of sync. When I press \"HbA1c\" I get medication, when I press \"Blood Pressure\" I get HbA1c and the \"Food\" bottom had a BP icon I get Blood Pressure",
            "I was so happy with this app. As a newly diagnosed diabetic I was using it to track my values for my first follow up visit. After collecting over three weeks of values, I felt confident enough to enter a target for my fasting value. The app immediately stopped working and I haven't been able to open it since! I'm terrified it will never operate again and all that tracking data is lost.",
            "Simple, easy to use and very useful app. However there is a mix up with the colour dots (orange and green) on the graphs for pre and post meal). On some graphs orange is for pre and green for post-meal, and on others it's the reverse. Please correct this and app gets 5 stars.",
            "I love that you can log everything in real time or go back if you forgot something. And tha you can email it to your Dr. Office."

Additionally the current version as per another comment doesn't have an active graph for caregivers or a trend arrow, hopefully this is addressed soon (there is a graph but it doesn't populate) in an updated version.",

This leads me to believe that their program was created only as a sales tool for whatever products they are hawking. The website is no help either. \"Ask Sophia\" answered my question before i was finished typing which is very suspicious.",
            "Best of the best. No more writting down numbers and food diaries. They literally have thought of everything. I love the easy way it auto syncs wirelessly with my Bg meter, & the way it shows me instant info and trends, counts my carbs and keeps track of my activities and records all of it so when I or my Doc wants a report, it's as simple as sending an email. I haven't wanted for anything since using this app. I promise, give it a try, I'm confident you will feel the same as I do.",
            "I like the app but I have to sync it to my meter every day to track results. This causes my meter to show an error and I have to reset it. I get no error on my meter except when I sync it to the app. I'm considering deleting the app and just keeping the info on my meter. It helps to see it on the app but it's not worth the hassle.",

            "Will not allow me to login using my existing cornerstone for care account. Keeps saying account not found even though I have it open in a tab on my browser so I definitely have one. Won't allow me to make a whole new account. Basically useless & frustrating which is the last thing anyone needs right now."

Update 2020: Found a major flaw with the app, when trying to export logs there is no option to add to email as a PDF ect. Also when exporting to google drive for example the data is discombobulated and unusable. Hopefully this gets fixed soon because without an exporting function the app becomes useless, which is a shame.",
            "This app for recording BS, food intake, and insulin works great for me. Get the paid upgrade. It is well worth the money just for library of food carbs. The only thing I would like to see added is a simple operator\"s manual. The 'Help Section' is useful, but could be expanded.",
            "Jesus christ. This app auto selects part of your insulin and aims. If I took what this app suggests I would be dead! Not even close to being correct. A time when I can manually work out I need 18 units this all is telling me to take 32 units... uninstalled quickly.",
            "The app is easy to use . Helps me see the ups and downs and I like that it figures out the amount of insulin I need.",

            "App is painfully slow to load. Response time for a reading is completely unacceptable and for the price, there are competitors that can match the cost of test strips. Also, customer service is horrendous.",
            "This app, along with the Center Health Nano glucometer, is a game-changer for me! I've been using it for almost a month & I've learned so much about how different things (meals, medications, exercise, etc) affect my blood sugar. It's easy to use, inexpensive, & actually makes me enjoy getting my readings. I highly recommend it for anyone with diabetes.",
            "At first it seemed like a great idea, and the app while slow, worked great. My reading were accurate compared to other tests. The ISSUE is that I've tried MULTIPLE times to pause my subscription because I've got too many strips and they CONTINUE to charge me anyway. The app does not have a SEND button for messaging them so you are in good faith that your request got through!!",
            "Love the app, however. I have had to uninstall it 3 times in the po ast several months. I keeps locking up and tonight before I uninstalled the app it worked for 30 minutes without o po ening up. I have changed the battery 2 ti mb es I have an Android and it is a po ain to use this app. When it works it is great"

            "Issues with syncing BG monitor resolved and results are good, feedback is very good and helpful. Even though the app is connected to Google Fit or seems to be, nothing is being recorded in Fit. Can you please add Google Fit to the list of activity apps? I do not use a fitbit or smart watch at this time. Otherwise the app is top notch!",
            "I've not used the diabetes education features. I'm happy that the app will capture the BG data while the bloody test strips is still in the meter. I just start the app immediately after testing.",
            "Looks like a good app, bit it won't sync with my meter. I had minor problems with the original One Touch Reveal app, this is terrible.",
            "This is a great app, but I wish that it would sync with the LOSEIT app like it does FITBIT and/or keep the food Input, it would save a lot of time. The coaching and information is GREAT.",
            "(8/12/20 Update) Since the update to ver 1.5 build 132.1780, is way harder to enter data. Used to be able to do insulin and meds at same time, now you have to do one, go out, select other and then enter its value. Also, you can no longer enter insulin values higher than 99. If you take higher, you have to make 2 separate entries. The previous version was just starting to work well, now we're back to a screwed up app again. Will be dropping and moving to something else. Tired of this."

There are other monitoring apps that do the same thing, but they don't require passwords and lots of personal information. It's not worth it to use an app that locks you out of your information and requires a password for nonsensitive information.",

It is an incredible app. I can print up reports for my primary care Dr, keep track of my activities, log meals, and so much more! Thank you!",

            "This app has most of the basic data needed. Most people eat/drink the same things over the course of a week (i.e., milk) If these food items could be copied to the saved area or tagged somehow for quick selection. The food database could also have a seeable field for the brand names of products.",
            "I've paid two times for this app. I went with this app for the easy use. The food data base sold me and it still doesn't work. It would be nice for some tech help to get this feature working.",
            "Best app I've found to help calculate bolus as well as corrections and track carb consumption. Just with there was a basal function.",
            "Revised--I don know what changed but I can no longer give this 5 stars. The daily, and thus 30 day average are now calculated incorrectly. Today for example I was 67, 167, and 119. Making the daily average 117. The app says after I put in the 119 that my daily went from 115 to 134.  This makes no sense and is incorrect. The 30 day on my meter is 112, same readings entered into the app and the app says 130. Very annoying. I'll be looking for a new app despite liking the other features.   I've been type 1 for 50 years now--this is the best program i have found so far--simple to use and only what's needed to help keep things in control.  Only wish it came combined  with a program like fit day that had food carb values so i only had to use one program.",
            "I highly recommend this app. It is by far the best app I've tried for man aging my diabetes. I now have:  • an extensive database of foods I      eat that are cutomised to featuring my key information  • the ability to easily work out how much insulin to bolus as the app calculations are customised to match my known sensitivity variations throughout the day  • a graph tracking my trends making it simple to see if I need to make any adjustments for improved management of my blood glucose.  I have been using this app for several months now and it does everything I need it to. As a result I can make informed decisions which have improved my overall diabetes management markedly."

Haven't been using the app all that long, but more than long enough to be frustrated with having to • repeatedly kill the app, • turn off my meter, • turn them back on and \"hope\" it updates. This morning it took no less than turning the meter on and off at least 5 or 6 times and app at least 3 or 4 kills before it finally picked up the current reading. There's no where I've found that you can hit a refresh for it to activate and upload a reading. The \"Connect\" on the Home does nothing. You can tap and try swipe in every possible direction with absolutely nothing happening with the app.",

            "I like/don't like this app. The \"predict\" part is wrong 90% or more BUT it does let you know how much insulin is on board which is really helpful before bed or a workout. It tries really hard. I've tweaked it a lot. You can really fine tune the am blood sugar rises and changes to insulin sensitivity and sick day stuff too. So it is a mixed bag of goodies for a MDI Type 1, without a CGM. Helpful, but far from perfect or as advertised. I paid $50 for a year but I feel that is too much.",
            "Incredibly overpriced for what you get per month and cannot turn off the message indicator. I have vision problems and wasn't able to see the number of messages so I'm constantly looking to see what the message is - oh sorry just that you haven't gone pro yet. The other two messages can't be fixed because the website errors when you try to update info 6hat would remove the messages. Product bypasses Google for it's subscription and uses Digital River. Feels a little fly-by-night. Uninstalling.",
            "I have been using this app for a couple months and it works well. For me the app is overly complicated with too many settings/screens. I also wish I could turn off the predicted BG graph line. If I bolus correctly my BG trend is no where near the predicted graph line, so many times the app thinks I'm 200 when my BG is 150. And if I log the 150 BG the \"coach\" tells me I must have done something wrong.",
            "Was a great app, now with ads added the usability is rendered useless. There is a ad over the save button as well as you are unable to scroll the page to click on save when you add your BGL and the carb count. I know now that the ads started after the trail period was done. Possible solution for the advert problem: Allocate the ad container size on the display until the ad have been loaded. When you open the app and the ads have not been loaded yet and you click on \"Add\" then the display with inputs are rendered without taking into account the advert that will be displayed in few seconds. If the app reserve the advert's space then when you are adding values the advert will not block the \"Ok\" or \"Save\" buttons."

        "description": "When you have diabetes, a primary goal is to keep it under control. Here are some simple things you can do each day to help achieve that goal.\r\n\r\nExercise\r\nRegular physical activity helps you feel better. It also improves your sensitivity to insulin, which means it works better in your body. Because it does, your blood sugar levels can become more stable.\r\n\r\nExercise can also help ease stress.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't active now, start slow. Then build up how much exercise you get over time. Shoot for 4 to 7 periods of activity each week. Try to make each period last for at least 30 minutes. And you don't have to work out at the gym to be active. Take the stairs instead of an elevator, or park at the far end of the lot. Both add exercise to your daily routine.\r\n\r\nHave a realistic goal and make a plan. What exercises will you do, and when will you do them? For example, you might plan to walk 30 minutes most days on your lunch break.\r\n\r\nChange your activities often enough so you don't get bored. You can do aerobic activities like walking or jogging. And resistance exercises like working out with weights offer another option. Whatever you do, don't forget to stretch before and after each workout session.\r\n\r\nIt's important to realize that exercise lowers your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to adjust your meds or insulin dose to keep your levels high enough.\r\n\r\nEat a Well-Balanced Diet\r\nHaving diabetes shouldn't keep you from enjoying a bunch of different foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to fill half your plate with non-starchy vegetables such as:\r\n\r\nAsparagus\r\nBroccoli\r\nCarrot\r\nCucumber\r\nSalad greens\r\nSquash\r\nTomato\r\nYou can also get protein from vegetarian things like tofu.\r\n\r\nStick to whole-grain foods. If you eat cereals, check the ingredients and make sure whole grain is first on the list.\r\n\r\nExamples of whole grains include:\r\n\r\nBrown rice\r\nBulgur (cracked wheat)\r\nReduce Stress\r\nIf you're stressed, you may exercise less, drink more, and not watch your diabetes as closely.\r\n\r\nStress can raise your blood sugar and make you less sensitive to insulin. When you're stressed, your body adopts a \"fight or flight\" response. That means it will make sure you have enough sugar and fat available for energy.\r\n\r\nStudies of people with type 1 diabetes found blood sugar levels go up for most people under mental stress and down for others. If you have type 2 diabetes and you're feeling pressure, your glucose will go up.",

Last update: Nov. 2019.\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Recipes. Most popular recipes on leading web sites.\r\n\r\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. In case of diabetes, there are numerous symptoms and health risks that might accompany it. Thus, we have included separate guidelines for the following common conditions along with diabetes: Alzheimer’s disease, diabetic retinopathy, erectile dysfunction, hearing loss, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, kidney well-being, nerve well-being, obesity, osteoporosis, and skin well-being. Also included are guidelines for DASH diet (recently recommended for diabetes patients).\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Also included are suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nThe primary sources used by Personal Remedies (PR) are US government sources such as USDA, NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPR is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions in the market, based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis.

            "I could never keep my bg in control before I started using the CGM/this app. My extreme highs and lows have settled into a very minimally variable horizontal line within range most days. My time in range is phenomenally good. It's as if I was blind before, but now have glasses to see. I love this app! And I am feeling so much better because my glucose control is better. I have energy, can think/concentrate, have lost weight because I'm no longer \"feeding the insulin, and sleep better.",
            "Once again...for as advanced as the G6 is, the app should be compatible with more than just the \"latest\" IPhone. I have Samsung Fold and was sad to find it wasn't compatible. Only 20% of population has an Iphone. The receiver reminds me of a flip phone I had 10 years ago. Please update for MODERN Android phones.",
            "Another crappy app by dexcom with huge design flaws. It takes forever to produce a report and during that time if the app loses focus (if you switch to another app or if your screen turns off) the report production will cancel without warning and without informing you. So you have to wait several minutes while touching the screen every few seconds to make sure your screen doesn't turn off while the app does its thing. This is ridiculous.",
            "Yeah, it helps me to refine and schedule my meal changes, periods of activity, BG insulin corrections and my exercise program by showing BG pattern changes periodically throughout the previous day. Kudos for a reliable, well-considered app for helping the diabetic and his care team in dealing with the challenges of diabetes!",
            "Extremely helpful. A must needed tool to control and figure out best treatment, like what foods trigger my blood sugar. I keep a low sugar / carb diet. I have a difficult situation. I also take ani rejection meds steroids which cause my blood sugar to go up as well without this app I was always guessing now I know exactly how to control my issues when they're high which they are many times I'm able to correct due to my steroids"

It’s what gives us our energy. We get glucose when our bodies break down the carbohydrates that we eat or drink. And that glucose is released into our blood.\r\n\r\nWe also need a hormone called insulin. It’s made by our pancreas, and it’s insulin that allows the glucose in our blood to enter our cells and fuel our bodies.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have diabetes, your pancreas senses when glucose has entered your bloodstream and releases the right amount of insulin, so the glucose can get into your cells. But if you have diabetes, this system doesn’t work.\r\n\r\nthere are also various ways to cure diseases:\r\n• How To Cure Wheezing\r\n• How To Cure Anxiety\r\n• How To Cure Acne\r\n• How To Cure Asthma\r\n• How To Cure Autism\r\n• How To Cure Allergies\r\n• How To Cure Backpain\r\n• How To Cure Bleeding\r\n• How To Cure Bloating\r\n• How To Cure Cancer\r\n• How To Cure Cough\r\n• How To Cure Constipation\r\n• How To Cure Cold\r\n• How To Cure Chapped Lips\r\n• How To Cure Cramps\r\n• How To Cure Chicken Pox\r\n• How To Cure Depression\r\n• How To Cure Diarrhea\r\n• How To Cure Diabetes\r\n• How To Cure Dizziness\r\n• and others\r\n\r\nThis application is free.

Highly recommend it for its functionality and value for money in the detail they put into the app. Useful tips and news feeds as well provide helpful information at a glance. First time user and lifetime customer now (or when I can beat this disease). I found using the app helps me be more accountable about my diabetes management. Real data beats anecdotal evidence and the figures don't lie. With the inclusion of a free text field in the Blood Glucose section in the next version update, I'll now be able to input my food intake as well which will bring together everything I need to collect the data that will help me monitor my progress and diet. Keep up the good work Dr Nizar and thank you for providing this app.",
            "Very easy to use App, like how the dashboard is organised. Tiles change colour according to my latest results so it's easy to know what to focus. Meal time targets are easy to understand. Helpful tile on tracking weight. Finally like how it's so easy to share data with PDF.",
            "Amazing app. Can save all diabetes tests in one place, dashboard is amazing with tiles that change color to depending on the latest result! Like the meal specific targets. HbA1c is converted to an average blood glucose so it's easy to relate to it.",

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

I'm also a Software Engineer, After about 6 months of using the paper based Diabetic eDiary given to me by the hospital, I decided I could do something much better. Like most people nowadays, I carry my mobile/cell phone with me everywhere, and I got pretty fed up carrying the diary and a pen every day!\r\n\r\nThe Diary component, (arguably the most important part) closely represents the traditional hand-written diary and can be transferred to your PC or emailed to your diabetic consultant with a couple of touches. Also within the diary you can add notes against readings if you want and a useful feature I added is that readings will flash heart icons if you have undertaken any exercise (walking/sport) within the previous 4 hours. \r\n\r\nThe eDiary also allows you to record main meals (it terms of carbohydrates), and importantly, allows easy and quick recording of exercise/walking events.\r\n\r\nAlthough my primary goal was to have something that replaced the paper based Diabetic eDiary, for me to keep using it over the longer term it needed to be fast, slick, simple to use and not something that would take over my life. \r\n\r\nI also wanted some nice graphing/pie chart displays as well as having the ability to back up my data, move it to another phone if need be, or even email my Diabetic nurse/consultant with the Diabetic eDiary (or my full results) when I visited the clinic.\r\n\r\nI've been used this app for about two years now, accumulating a lot of data and adding functionality and fixing bugs as I've gone along. The amount of time required to input a blood glucose measurement, related insulin injection and food value is minimal. This has been a primary reason why I have kept using it regularly and missed very few entries in my eDiary over the entire two year period.\r\n\r\nTo still be using this application after more than 2 years is a real success for me, as it's always very easy to become complacent and stop recording measurements when it takes too much time or effort.",

Search:\r\n\r\nIncreased thirst\r\nfrequent urination\r\nIncrease hunger\r\nWeight loss unintentionally\r\nfatigue\r\nFoggy vision\r\nSlow healing of sores\r\nFrequent infections\r\nAreas of dark skin, usually in the armpits and neck.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a doctor\r\n\r\nConsult your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nthe reasons\r\n\r\nType 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes insulin-resistant or when the pancreas can not produce enough insulin. The exact cause of this is unknown, although genetic and environmental factors, such as weight gain and inactivity, seem to be contributing factors.\r\nHow Insulin works\r\n\r\nInsulin is a hormone that comes from the gland located behind and under the stomach (pancreas).\r\n\r\nThe pancreas secrete insulin in the bloodstream.\r\nInsulin circulates and allows sugar to enter the cells.\r\nInsulin reduces the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.\r\nWith low blood sugar, the secretion of insulin from the pancreas is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe role of glucose.\r\n\r\nGlucose, sugar, is a major source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and other tissues.\r\n\r\nGlucose comes from two main sources: food and liver.\r\nSugar is absorbed into the blood stream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\r\nThe liver stores and produces glucose.\r\nWhen glucose levels are low, such as not eaten for a long time, the glycogen-stored liver breaks down in glucose to maintain a normal glucose level.\r\n\r\nIn type 2 diabetes, this process does not work well. Instead of moving to cells, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream. As blood sugar levels rise, insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells deteriorate and can not produce enough insulin to meet the body's requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the first type of diabetes, which is less common, the immune system mistakenly destroys beta cells, leaves the body without insulin or does not contain any type of insulin.\r\nRisk factors\r\n\r\nFactors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:\r\n\r\nthe weight. Weight gain is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, you do not have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.\r\nFat distribution. If you store fat mainly in the abdomen, you have a risk of type 2 diabetes compared to storing fat elsewhere, such as hips and thighs. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if you are a man with a circumference of more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) or a woman with a waist greater than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters).\r\nIdle. The lower your activity, the higher your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.\r\nFamily history The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your father or brother has type 2 diabetes.\r\nProfession. Although it is not clear why, people of certain races, including blacks, Latins, American Indians and Asian Americans, are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites.\r\nYears. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after the age of 45. This may be because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they get older. However, type 2 diabetes is increasing significantly among children, adolescents and young people.\r\nIntroduction to diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be labeled as diabetes. If left untreated,",

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

We have protocols for Acupressure, Acupuncture, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Bach Flower Remedy, Color Therapy, Diet and Nutrition, Exercise, Herbal Therapy, Juice Therapy, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Shiatsu, Sound Therapy, Tai Chi, TCM, Vitamin Therapy, Yoga, Sujok, Auricular Therapy, Hydrotherapy, Rife Therapy, Visualization, Reiki, Magnet Therapy. These protocols when used under proper guidance gives more better feeling and as all the protocols are complementary / alternative therapy it comes with no side effects on application. For one problem – Diabetes, this app provides you many different methods of alternative remedies to manage your blood sugar level and that to absolutely FREE!!! \r\n\r\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well or insulin resistance. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.\r\n Learn about Diabetes symptoms, causes and treatment  from this App. What diet sugar patient should follow? Maintaining, controlling blood sugar levels is part of managing diabetes. Doctors often prescribe traditional treatments, like insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels normal. Some people with diabetes also use complementary and alternative therapies (CAM). These therapies aim to treat the body and the mind.\r\n This App gives information on Diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, gestational diabetes, diabetes related weight, hypertension / blood pressure, treatment and guidelines.\r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your diabetes, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage your diabetes is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in managing diabetes with alternative techniques.\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments. \r\n \r\nThis app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your blood sugar levels and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care.",

For one problem – Diabetes, this app provides you many different methods of alternative remedies to manage your blood sugar level and that to absolutely FREE!!! <br><br>Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well or insulin resistance. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.<br> Learn about Diabetes symptoms, causes and treatment  from this App. What diet sugar patient should follow? Maintaining, controlling blood sugar levels is part of managing diabetes. Doctors often prescribe traditional treatments, like insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels normal. Some people with diabetes also use complementary and alternative therapies (CAM). These therapies aim to treat the body and the mind.<br> This App gives information on Diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, gestational diabetes, diabetes related weight, hypertension / blood pressure, treatment and guidelines.<br>If you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your diabetes, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. <br><br>There are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage your diabetes is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in managing diabetes with alternative techniques.<br>There are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or &quot;alternative&quot; treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments. <br> <br>This app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your blood sugar levels and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care.",
