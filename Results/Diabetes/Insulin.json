The answers to every calculation are the same...the infinity sign. So I installed it on my phone instead...with the same result...infinity. Then I installed it on my new Samsung Tab A...same result. If you are going to create a program to help others, check ever so often to see if it can be installed still.",

Thanks for telling me I needed INFINITY insulin.. USELESS APP for me.",

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

É um ótimo aliado no tratamento do Diabetes tipo 1, ideal para quem faz contagem de carboidratos. Recomendo! Sugestão: seria legal pensar numa forma de poder compartilhar os dados de registros de glicemias e alimentação com o médico e nutricionista"

            "I like/don't like this app. The \"predict\" part is wrong 90% or more BUT it does let you know how much insulin is on board which is really helpful before bed or a workout. It tries really hard. I've tweaked it a lot. You can really fine tune the am blood sugar rises and changes to insulin sensitivity and sick day stuff too. So it is a mixed bag of goodies for a MDI Type 1, without a CGM. Helpful, but far from perfect or as advertised. I paid $50 for a year but I feel that is too much.",
            "Incredibly overpriced for what you get per month and cannot turn off the message indicator. I have vision problems and wasn't able to see the number of messages so I'm constantly looking to see what the message is - oh sorry just that you haven't gone pro yet. The other two messages can't be fixed because the website errors when you try to update info 6hat would remove the messages. Product bypasses Google for it's subscription and uses Digital River. Feels a little fly-by-night. Uninstalling.",
            "I have been using this app for a couple months and it works well. For me the app is overly complicated with too many settings/screens. I also wish I could turn off the predicted BG graph line. If I bolus correctly my BG trend is no where near the predicted graph line, so many times the app thinks I'm 200 when my BG is 150. And if I log the 150 BG the \"coach\" tells me I must have done something wrong.",
            "Was a great app, now with ads added the usability is rendered useless. There is a ad over the save button as well as you are unable to scroll the page to click on save when you add your BGL and the carb count. I know now that the ads started after the trail period was done. Possible solution for the advert problem: Allocate the ad container size on the display until the ad have been loaded. When you open the app and the ads have not been loaded yet and you click on \"Add\" then the display with inputs are rendered without taking into account the advert that will be displayed in few seconds. If the app reserve the advert's space then when you are adding values the advert will not block the \"Ok\" or \"Save\" buttons."

            "I can't think of any features not already included. The bolus advisor was invaluable in helping me resolve highs and lows. A1c dropped from 7.0 to 6.0 in 2 months. I created a Notes category and use the filter to see only my Notes. I upgraded to Premium, but the free version includes plenty of bells & whistles. I highly recommend this app! Don't know how I managed without it! Bonus: I can print reports directly from Samsung phone to Samsung printer using Samsung print app.",
            "I have been using this after using Glooko for several years. it is more complex and send to have more features. I switched because it will read my Libre Freestyle sensor directly. The Fitbit integration is not reliable; it is not picking up my weight. MyFitnessPal does a much better job of tracking nutrition. This app should just give up on nutrition teaching and instead integrate with MyFitnessPal. Overall I really like it; I have become a Premium subscriber.",
            "Pulls the wrong numbers from both glucometer and CGM. Using libre cgm and the libre link app will pull a completely different number from this app. When I check with a blood glucose reading, it shows the libre link to be the accurate one (as expected). Also when we use the glucometer, the app always imports a different number from the meter reading. I.e. meter will say 5.6 mmol & the app will record reading of 5.4 Food database is also finicky. Customer service completely ignores me every time.",
            "I do love this app And would use it for all of my diabetic care however I use a Libre2 monitoring system which is not supported by this app. This is not necessarily the fault of this app however is a fault of the libre system for not allowing the monitoring. If you have a libre2 or a 14 day don't bother it will not work",
            "This is a great app!! I showed it to my Doctor on my last visit and he was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with it!! He like it even more when I told him that it connected with my meter!! He noticed the estimated A1C, and later when he got my lab reports back, he made a point to tell me that my level was just as this app had estimated it to be!! Had another visit with this same Dr. on 8/5/20(MASK ON!). To emphasize how impressed he is with this app, he requested to see my latest results from this app!! 👍🏽"

I have 2 pens and both paired beautifully and work extremely well with the app. I did love the app until the last update.Having issues with long acting insulin and other reminders as they just very randomly appear. I wish the app paired my Freestyle CGM. It would be so beneficial and much more efficient to have have my readings come directly from CGM as I often forget to record my glucose levels. Otherwise I love the ease of operation.",
            "I really like this app a lot because it helps me keep track of my dosages however it's always always ALWAYS important to double check and verify because there are times when the inpen will malfunction and will not register your dose at all or will register it incorrectly. Maybe I got a bad pen I'm not sure but please be careful and double-check that the app has added your dosages correctly upon dosing! Also the colors inside the app are nauseating to me like the inside of a yogurt shop yuck.",

            "The perfect app for non-pumpers that like the features of a pump! We stopped pumping, and I really missed the ease of inputting info, and the dose being calculated. This app does everything! You set the therapy settings such as insulin to carb ratio and correction ratio. Then you simply input the carbs and/or blood sugar, and it calculates the dose you should give. It also keeps track of insulin on board so you don't stack doses! Using the InPen, everything is automated.",
            "Excellent app, the insulin calculator is the reason I got the inpen. I must enter my doses manually (bluetooth ON on my phone interferes with catching wifi), and the phone isn't compatible with dexcom to manually feed my BGs into the app. That severely limits the ease of the app, but dose calculator is king. My real complaint is with the update, both the HOME and LOGBOOK tabs look very similar now. I preferred the half-circle home screen which showed IOB prominently. Please make it more prominen"

            "It is mostly convenient to enter data, but I'd like the ability to change the defaults in Settings. For instance, my smart watch measures blood pressure on my left wrist, but the default is \"right arm\". For another, the readings I take in the morning up to early afternoon are all 'Fasting', but the app tries to be helpful by suggesting an event label based on an average person's schedule.",
            "I am pre diabetic and need to regularly measure my blood sugar. I love being able to log my numbers in without having to go through a tedious menu. Its also got an alarm I can pgm to remind myself to do it. Oh, and itll show me if my numbers are \"normal\" or \"too high\". I am sure it must have a \"too low\" category, but my numbers are never that low.",
            "Very easy to use, that's main need. Can be exported but I'd prefer it to be able to be saved or backed up to my Dropbox acct. Notes aspect is confusing since it's not actually separate from the actual things you're tracking. That should be a note feature that doesn't get attached to anything. Also the food is only in grams which I'm not going to use. I will be trying other apps, but if my few needs here we're there, I'd have picked my app by now.",
            "Nice clean interface on a basic record keeping app for diabetics. Not a lot of bells and whistles. I use it for my cat's glucose and insulin. I particularly like the quick entry option by pressing + at the main menu to add a reading. It could use some improvement in terms of managing the list of medications, though. We only use one, but I still have to select it from the list each time. There's probably a file I can edit or something, but it's not spelled out anywhere I've seen.",
            "I've used this app for a number of years now. It is a great way for me to keep a record for my doctors as well as myself. Thank you! At this point, however two-years following my last review, I am a bit frustated. Again I am attempting to share my numbers with my doctor. But this time the app does not provide the BP readings for print or any other modes of transmitting; only blood glucose. I am disappointed right now!"

            "The original app was good because even if the reader canceled out the sensor because it didn't like it's readings, the phone app would still continue to take readings and give you those results and they were still accurate! Now they both cancel out the sensors even when the sensors don't need to be canceled out, like having multiple low readings in a row will cancel out a sensor even though they're accurate valid readings!",
            "4.5 stars, actually. I went from an A1c of 7.3 to 5.6 in 90 days of using the sensor in combination with my Samsung Note 10+. Works like a charm. Easy and fast. Lots of logbook variables to track meals, carbs, trends, averages, etc. I'm sold! Libra Freestyle. Not as accurate as Dexcim G6 for low bs and high bs, per objective reviewers, but very cost effective. Knowing my BS at anytime helps me to dose more efficiently then doing based on a few random fingersticks several times a day.",
            "Great and accurate!! My endocrinologist has access to the data which helps in controlling my sugars as well as less doctors visits. Helping alot to get my Diabetes under control!!! The only issue i have is that i have the Librelink 2 now and it does not work with phone. Can you please update for use. Thanks!!!",
            "THIS IS A GE CHANGER. My insurance doesn't pay for it...Therefore, it costs me $60 / month.... WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNIE. However!! YOU MUST Follow the directions to know EXACTLY where to place the sensor on the back of your arm. . . Push as hard as u can at 1st contact & make sure you don't sweat for the next hour (; wait 1 hour before working out ;)",
            "I love the phone app. The sensors need a refit. Mine only occasionally stayed on 14 days. The norm was ten and I have had at least four of the last shipment died upon placing them on my arm! Oh, and it usually reads 100 plus or minus my hand held meter. Now that I think about it, I'd take away one of my stars, if it would let me!"

Right now, I changed the time blocks to increase my insulin sensitivity until 11 p.m., but it would be more flexible to be able to add it like an insulin or glucose entry box because timing varies and it has a half life of 45 min.  Right now, I use the Exercise 2 Event button and adjust it to 50%, but can I somehow change the event title to Symlin?",
            "I like all of the app except for the My Data function. I am in the USA and use mg/dL measurements for BG. That means pretty much that 100 mg/dL is good control. Below 80  is low BG and above 180 is high BG. The app handles this system well except for  My Data. When I check previous measurements, the last ten readings are 25, 44, 23, 19, 18, 16, 10, 11,11,11. If those are mg/dl, then I am dead. I wouldn't have survived the first 11mg/dL. These readings all have the big red blood drop and mg/dL behind them to signify that they are the blood glucose readings. I wish that app writer would fix this as I have no accurate record of BG."

            "Great app! I've used several diabetes trackers and this is the best, for average use. It allows you to track the important stuff your doctors ask for and provides exports of data, but it's simple to use and not too complicated to set up. I paid the $1.99 U.S. to upgrade to the Pro version with no ads. It's well worth that fee. ***IDEA FOR THE DEVELOPER*** I like the Measured drop list where I can select a description for each blood test, such as \"fasting\" or \"after breakfast.\" Would you mind expanding that just a little to match what doctors in the U.S. ask for? Here's what I'm thinking: (1) CHANGE the three existing \"Before\" meal options to say \"Immediately before.\" Example: \"Before breakfast\" would become \"Immediately before breakfast.\" (2) ADD three meal options that begin with \"2 hours before.\" Example: \"2 hours before breakfast.\" ***MORE IDEAS FOR DEVELOPER:*** (3) Allow me to set an automatic recurring backup to a cloud drive location of my choice, such as a Google Drive folder. (4) Provide the option of a web interface with quick data entry and data exports. I work on a computer all day so it would be faster for me to type my data into a bookmarked browser page than use my phone. I would only use my phone when I'm away from my computer. (5) You could add some \"about this app\" info inside the app. It might include the official name of the app, links to a web interface, company info, company email, developer info, links to review the app on Play Store, etc. Thanks for considering my ideas and thanks for making a great, stable app that is easy to use and understand!",
            "Great app. Easy to use for recording blood sugar and blood pressure levels and the report feature allows you to easily share your data with your doctor. The ads can be annoying, but for a free app that works well that is only a minor issue.",
            "Looks pretty good. Only thing I would suggest for an upgrade. With the blood pressure it is set on the right arm and it is necessary to change it every time for my left arm. It would be good if there was something in settings to be able to set it to the left arm permanently. Not only for us right-handed people. The bloke at the chemist where I bought my blood pressure device said that it is better to use the left arm. Something to do with the circulatory system.",
            "Excellent app. It helps remind me to watch what I eat. I can see the cause and effect of my choices. So this hells me stay on track. I love the \"Statistics\" data and the fact I can express the data to PDF for my doctor. I highly recommend this app 👍",
            "Great application. Just one thing is missing that there should be combined report chart of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight."

And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you’ve taken that important dose. \r\n\r\n💊A health tracker for your needs \r\nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications. People with diabetes use the built-in weight tracker and keep track of their blood glucose. Also, they use it as logbook for insulin and a medication reminder for Metformin etc. The built-in mood tracker supports you to keep track of your mental health or depression. Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n⏰A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app’s mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app’s symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\r\n\r\n💊Motivation to take your meds\r\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine. Involve family and friends with MyTherapy Team and successfully manage together. And you can even have your family see if you’ve missed a med despite the pill reminder, so they can help you stay on track.\r\nMyTherapy is for you, no matter if you are taking antibiotic medicines or deal with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, anxiety or depression that are often complicated.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

But it's very hard to find food history to see how to adjust dosing. Food items in the database do odd things when you change serving sizes. Syncing is largely unreliable and often comes a couple of days late. With all of Insulet's money behind this app, I'd expect it to be lots better.",

I've been trying to find a way to revert to an earlier version, but no luck so far",

            "It's easy to enter and edit glucose and bp readings in this app, but it is disappointing in terms of reporting the data. The Share with Doctor option creates a 'Comprehensive Report' including all entries for each date but with the dates completely jumbled up, which makes the report basically useless 😕",
            "I just started using this app. I like it but the buttons on the top are out of sync. When I press \"HbA1c\" I get medication, when I press \"Blood Pressure\" I get HbA1c and the \"Food\" bottom had a BP icon I get Blood Pressure",
            "I was so happy with this app. As a newly diagnosed diabetic I was using it to track my values for my first follow up visit. After collecting over three weeks of values, I felt confident enough to enter a target for my fasting value. The app immediately stopped working and I haven't been able to open it since! I'm terrified it will never operate again and all that tracking data is lost.",
            "Simple, easy to use and very useful app. However there is a mix up with the colour dots (orange and green) on the graphs for pre and post meal). On some graphs orange is for pre and green for post-meal, and on others it's the reverse. Please correct this and app gets 5 stars.",
            "I love that you can log everything in real time or go back if you forgot something. And tha you can email it to your Dr. Office."

            "I like this app, it is fairly simple to use and the analysis tools are easy to understand. (I'm a Type 2 who doesn't take meds or insulin..)  However there is a drawback, the app is set up so you can only input values before & after each meal. It does NOT allow for more frequent testing .There is no way to input additional readings.   Today I tested to see  if I peak  2 hrs after a meal or if my blood glucose peaks earlier or later. I tested, 1 hour after a meal, 2 hours after & 3 hours after. There is no way of entering these additional readings into this app (unlike other apps.) I know other people with diabetes who test at bedtime & during the night because they have dawn phenomena (a rise on waking) Some Type 2s test for low blood sugar if they suspect a medication is lowering their blood sugar too much. . As well, Type 1 diabetics often test before exercise, if they suspect hypoglycemia & before driving (driving too low a glucose level is dangerous.)  Therefore I cannot recommend this app for any Type 1s. For Type 2s, I'd only recommend it for those who don't take any meds (other than metformin) or insulin."

I would also love to see some features such as being able to bolus, zoom in/out graph view, statistics, and many more. Looking forward to the next update!",

There should be a setting in the app to turn off mobile data usage, otherwise the app is unusable. ...

        "description": "Diabetes mellitus is a disease that prevents your body from properly using the energy from the food you eat. Diabetes occurs in one of the following situations:\r\n\r\nThe pancreas (an organ behind your stomach) produces little insulin or no insulin at all. Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone, produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which helps the body use sugar for energy.\r\n-Or-\r\n\r\nThe pancreas makes insulin, but the insulin made does not work as it should. This condition is called insulin resistance.\r\nTo better understand diabetes, it helps to know more about how the body uses food for energy (a process called metabolism).\r\n\r\nYour body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, the cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose provides the energy your body needs for daily activities.\r\n\r\nThe blood vessels and blood are the highways that transport sugar from where it is either taken in (the stomach) or manufactured (in the liver) to the cells where it is used (muscles) or where it is stored (fat). Sugar cannot go into the cells by itself. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood, which serves as the helper, or the \"key,\" that lets sugar into the cells for use as energy.\r\n\r\nWhen sugar leaves the bloodstream and enters the cells, the blood sugar level is lowered. Without insulin, or the \"key,\" sugar cannot get into the body's cells for use as energy. This causes sugar to rise. Too much sugar in the blood is called \"hyperglycemia\" (high blood sugar).",

Also when exporting to google drive for example the data is discombobulated and unusable. Hopefully this gets fixed soon because without an exporting function the app becomes useless, which is a shame.",

            "I have only been using this app for a few days but I love it so far. It's so easy to check my blood sugars for the day or week. It clearly highlights when they are too high and it's so confidential l convenient that you can share with a clinic. I don't have to worry about writing down my results and bringing them in for visits!",
            "This app makes me more aware of how the food that I eat effects my blood glucose every day. I have seen better results in my A1C levels when I get checked by my doctor every three months! I recommend this app for others who may not have this valuable information to keep their health in good shape! Last A1C was 5.7 !!",
            "Worse app and even the meter looks like a very cheap toy. I have an accu-chek that is way better but it drains battery like crazy Onetouch doesn't always synchronize and when it does it takes few tries. The replies from their reviews is a joke. Same message for everyone having difficulties. I guess some companies get a pass with terrible products like this one and end up getting big market for this garbage.",
            "Just purchased, just starting monitoring, down loaded app and turned meter on and synced. I wasn't sure what I was doing and took couple tries but synced once I followed directions. I am using Galaxy A70. Once I start using app with readings, I will update this . Update I have been using the app for about a month. I found if I open app then minimize it, then press OK on monitor as it is booting up, tap app to open it. Both will sync. Give it a few seconds. I upgraded to 4 stars...",
            "Using it for about 15 months. Easy to use. Clearly shows glucose trends. Companion website makes it easy to produce reports for the doctor to review. Ability to record activity and carbohydrates consumed provides the doctor additional information relating to glucose numbers."

        "description": "The purpose of a glucose monitoring system is to help you, a diabetic dog owner, to regulate your dog’s glucose level. Many pet owners dislike lancing their dogs to draw blood to monitor their pets’ glucose with portable blood glucose meters (“PBGM”). They inject insulin daily without testing their pets' glucose, which can be dangerous to you dog’s health.\r\n\r\nVet-Tab is an at-home, glucose monitoring system allowing you to painlessly test your dog's saliva to monitor its blood glucose level with a tab and your smartphone. Saliva is collected on the tab, which turns a color based on the level of glucose. A smartphone app captures an image of the tab, similar to capturing an image of a check to be deposited. The app analyzes the image and displays a blood glucose result on your phone.\r\n\r\nMany pet owners monitor their dogs’ glucose using Vet-Tab, which is significantly better than not monitoring glucose at all. In addition, monitoring your dog at home in a low stress environment can provide more accurate results than testing in a veterinary practice where stress raises your dog’s glucose level. When the result displayed is 80 or below, 350 or above, a message on the phone display advices you to contact your veterinarian for professional advice.\r\n\r\nIf you choose, a chart of your test results can be emailed from the app to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian can better regulate your dog’s glucose comparing your at-home test trends with clinical tests they perform in their clinic.\r\n\r\nVET-TAB IS A WIN/WIN/WIN SOLUTION\r\n- Your dog is healthier.\r\n- You do not need to lance the dog to draw blood to monitor its glucose.\r\n- Your veterinarian receives your at-home test results to help better regulate your dog.\r\n\r\nVALIDATION OF THE VET-TAB SYSTEM\r\nDevelopment of the Vet-Tab system began in the summer of 2017. Since then thousands of tests on diabetic and non-diabetic dogs have been conducted by Dr. Rebecca Silveston-Keith, Chief Technology Officer, and the technical team in 20 veterinary practices in South Carolina and Georgia. The results of these tests have been reviewed with Dr. Delphine Dean, Gregg-Graniteville Professor of Bioengineering at Clemson University; Dr. David Dawkins, a veterinarian at the Eastside Animal Hospital in Spartanburg, SC; and Dr Cynthia Ward, VMD, PhD, DACVIM, Professor of Internal Medicine University of Georgia College of Veterinary Science\r\n\r\nField trials validated the accuracy of the Vet-Tab Glucose Monitoring System throughout 2018 with 150 dogs and culminated with a month long study of 54 dogs in participating veterinary practices. Nine dogs were disqualified because of interference factors, discussed below. Blood glucose determined by Vet-Tab was compared to the measurement of blood glucose by lab tests. Literature reporting data from the determination of glucose by continuous glucose monitors measuring interstitial fluid relative to blood tests for diabetic pets showed a similar level of accuracy as the Vet-Tab data. Continuous glucose monitors are well accepted devices for monitoring blood glucose in diabetic patients.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of the Vet-Tab system is sufficient for its use in at-home, glucose monitoring of diabetic dogs.\r\n\r\nAs is true with other glucose monitoring systems, there are factors that interfere with the Vet-Tab system. We have incorporated features into the system to address the first two of these factors.\r\n\r\nVet-Tab is not currently supported on -LG and Motorola phones\r\nPets taking the following medications: Gabapentin, Fluoextine, Alprazolam, Tramadol, or LThyroxine.

I continued to use it and my latest 90 day reading was 6.1..I went on 5/15/20 to get a reading and it was 7.8. I record several times a day so I'm not understanding the inaccuracy. I'm very disappointed and will most likely uninstall this app and find another more accurate app.",

It's a great app, but I could use some help accessing my log and 30, 90 day averages. Update: I just discovered that the menu is still there, it's just \"hidden\".

        "description": "The pancreas is about 6 inches long and sits across the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen and is connected to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) through a small tube called the pancreatic duct. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body.\r\n\r\n            Pancreas Conditions\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 1: The body’s immune system attacks and destroys the pancreas’ insulin-producing cells. Lifelong insulin injections are required to control blood sugar.\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 2: The pancreas loses the ability to appropriately produce and release insulin. The body also becomes resistant to insulin, and blood sugar rises.\r\n\r\nCystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems, usually including the lungs and the pancreas. Digestive problems and diabetes often result.\r\nPancreatic cancer: The pancreas has many different types of cells, each of which can give rise to a different type of tumor. The most common type arises from the cells that line the pancreatic duct. Because there are usually few or no early symptoms, pancreatic cancer is often advanced by the time it’s discovered.\r\n\r\nPancreatitis: The pancreas becomes inflamed and damaged by its own digestive chemicals. Swelling and death of tissue of the pancreas can result. Although alcohol or gallstones can contribute, sometimes a cause for pancreatitis is never found.\r\nPancreatic pseudocyst: After a bout of pancreatitis, a fluid-filled cavity called a pseudocyst can form. Pseudocysts may resolve spontaneously, or they may need surgical drainage.\r\nIslet cell tumor: The hormone-producing cells of the pancreas multiply abnormally, creating a benign or cancerous tumor.  These tumors produce excess amounts of hormones and then release them into the blood. Gastrinomas, glucagonomas, and insulinomas are examples of islet cell tumors.\r\n\r\nEnlarged pancreas: An enlarged pancreas may mean nothing. You may simply have a pancreas that is larger than normal. Or, it can be because of an anatomic abnormality. But other causes of an enlarged pancreas may exist and require treatment.\r\n    \r\n          Pancreas Tests\r\n\r\nPhysical examination: By pressing on the center of the belly, a doctor might check for a mass in the pancreas. He or she can also look for other signs of pancreas conditions.\r\nComputed tomography scan: A CT scanner takes multiple X-rays, and a computer creates detailed images of the pancreas and abdomen. Contrast dye may be injected into your veins to improve the images.\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Magnetic waves create highly detailed images of the abdomen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an MRI that focuses on the pancreas, liver, and bile system.\r\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): Using a camera on a flexible tube advanced from the mouth to the intestine, a doctor can access the area of the pancreas head. Tiny surgical tools can be used to diagnose and treat some pancreas conditions.\r\nPancreas biopsy: Either using a needle through the skin or a surgical procedure, a small piece of pancreas tissue is removed to look for cancer or other conditions.\r\nUltrasound: A probe is placed on the belly, and harmless sound waves create images by reflecting off the pancreas and other organs.\r\nAmylase and lipase: Blood tests showing elevated levels of these pancreatic enzymes can suggest pancreatitis.\r\nSweat chloride test: A painless electric current stimulates the skin to sweat, and the chloride in perspiration is measured. People with cystic fibrosis often have high sweat chloride levels.\r\nGenetic testing: Many different mutations of a single gene can cause cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing can help identify if an adult is an unaffected carrier or if a child will develop cystic fibrosis.\r\n   \r\n       Pancreas Treatments;\r\nInsulin  Injection\r\nPseudocyst drainage\r\nPseudocyst surgery\r\npancreatic cancer\r\nPancreatic enzymes\r\nPancreas transplantation",

            "It's ok. Definitely not great. • No way to log med dosages, especially as I want to track how much insulin I'm taking each time and with certain readings. Haven't been using the app all that long, but more than long enough to be frustrated with having to • repeatedly kill the app, • turn off my meter, • turn them back on and \"hope\" it updates. This morning it took no less than turning the meter on and off at least 5 or 6 times and app at least 3 or 4 kills before it finally picked up the current reading. There's no where I've found that you can hit a refresh for it to activate and upload a reading. The \"Connect\" on the Home does nothing. You can tap and try swipe in every possible direction with absolutely nothing happening with the app.",
            "This app is easy to use, with a clean dashboard and an intuitive interface. It appears that some potential functions yet are to be developed fully, as evidenced by filter options and suggested titles in reports. However, it is a good app for monitoring blood glucose and better than the one provided by the manufacturer of my device.",

I've used SiDiary online for several years, but still has a long way to go towards being great. Edit to add: I've used the desktop version of SiDiary for nearly a decade. It's still cumbersome and in need of improvement.",

Pretty expensive thermometer now as I need to run the program and, after a few minutes, get connected for its buffered data. No real live updates or alarms due to back ground sleep. Lost connectivity due to power saving is reported issue. Was awesome while it worked.",
            "very useful but nit user friendly. every time i open the data i dont want to zoom in 50 times to see the last 1hr 6hr and day info which is relevant. who cares about last month? should default to showing last 3hrs and allow zoom out from there. have some buttons to change scope to last hrs last day etc... also.. after synch lots if missing data points",
            "As many others have written, the app crashes constantly on Android 10. They simply don't respond to requests for help or seem to care about their customers in any way. If they hired a decent software engineer, the problems would be solved in minutes instead of months, but the company's lack of communication is really unacceptable. UPDATE: The issue was eventually fixed, and the system works as designed again. Hopefully, if any similar issues arise in the future, they'll be resolved faster.",
            "Not sure what happened to the app notification but mine has stopped working. I have two MedAngels I keep track of, but as of right now the notification is saying app not responding. I have a Google pixel.... It looks like other people are having the same difficulty. A reply would be nice considering the cost of these little devices. ?",
            "Crashes once I get past a certain point in setup and then constantly thereafter. Developer has not replied to my open support ticket for three weeks and counting. Update: Finally got in touch *four months* later to ask me to update my review, without any email contact. The app is working now, but this level of unresponsiveness is unacceptable."

            "I love my Nano and Center Health app. It's so easy to use, and I love that it is all tracked right in my phone. And not just my numbers, but other important information too. It's been a great change and helps me manage my blood sugars so much better.",
            "App is painfully slow to load. Response time for a reading is completely unacceptable and for the price, there are competitors that can match the cost of test strips. Also, customer service is horrendous.",
            "This app, along with the Center Health Nano glucometer, is a game-changer for me! I've been using it for almost a month & I've learned so much about how different things (meals, medications, exercise, etc) affect my blood sugar. It's easy to use, inexpensive, & actually makes me enjoy getting my readings. I highly recommend it for anyone with diabetes.",
            "At first it seemed like a great idea, and the app while slow, worked great. My reading were accurate compared to other tests. The ISSUE is that I've tried MULTIPLE times to pause my subscription because I've got too many strips and they CONTINUE to charge me anyway. The app does not have a SEND button for messaging them so you are in good faith that your request got through!!",
            "Love the app, however. I have had to uninstall it 3 times in the po ast several months. I keeps locking up and tonight before I uninstalled the app it worked for 30 minutes without o po ening up. I have changed the battery 2 ti mb es I have an Android and it is a po ain to use this app. When it works it is great"

Highly recommend it for its functionality and value for money in the detail they put into the app. Useful tips and news feeds as well provide helpful information at a glance. First time user and lifetime customer now (or when I can beat this disease). I found using the app helps me be more accountable about my diabetes management. Real data beats anecdotal evidence and the figures don't lie. With the inclusion of a free text field in the Blood Glucose section in the next version update, I'll now be able to input my food intake as well which will bring together everything I need to collect the data that will help me monitor my progress and diet. Keep up the good work Dr Nizar and thank you for providing this app.",
            "Very easy to use App, like how the dashboard is organised. Tiles change colour according to my latest results so it's easy to know what to focus. Meal time targets are easy to understand. Helpful tile on tracking weight. Finally like how it's so easy to share data with PDF.",
            "Amazing app. Can save all diabetes tests in one place, dashboard is amazing with tiles that change color to depending on the latest result! Like the meal specific targets. HbA1c is converted to an average blood glucose so it's easy to relate to it.",

Without the capacity to make adequate amounts of insulin, the body is not able to metabolize blood glucose (sugar), to use it efficiently for energy, and toxic acids (called ketoacids) build up in the body. There is a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe disease tends to occur in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood (before age 30) but it may have its clinical onset at any age. The symptoms and signs of type 1 diabetes characteristically appear abruptly, although the damage to the beta cells may begin much earlier and progress slowly and silently.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and signs include a great thirst, hunger, a need to urinate often, and loss of weight.

            "(8/12/20 Update) Since the update to ver 1.5 build 132.1780, is way harder to enter data. Used to be able to do insulin and meds at same time, now you have to do one, go out, select other and then enter its value. Also, you can no longer enter insulin values higher than 99. If you take higher, you have to make 2 separate entries. The previous version was just starting to work well, now we're back to a screwed up app again. Will be dropping and moving to something else.

            "I have the Diabetes & Diet Tracker, and it is very easy to use. I record all my food every day, and the app is very helpful for me personally. Weight loss is made more difficult when you have a ton of emotional baggage like I have. Having the facts - the actual numbers - in front of me helps me stay on track. I also must mention the scanner. It is wonderful!",
            "App works great. Fairly easy to learn and use. Would be 5 stars if it showed a total daily macros on a pie chart instead of a huge layout form that is very difficult to read and quite useless. Like the diabetes carb count, that is most useful to me. Would also like to know how to delete self created recipes but help section isn't very helpful and doesn't explain how. Love the huge database with many foods I use and happy with how easy and quick it is to add the odd new food that isn't there."

The food database could also have a seeable field for the brand names of products.",
            "I've paid two times for this app. I went with this app for the easy use. The food data base sold me and it still doesn't work. It would be nice for some tech help to get this feature working.",
            "Best app I've found to help calculate bolus as well as corrections and track carb consumption. Just with there was a basal function.",
            "Revised--I don know what changed but I can no longer give this 5 stars. The daily, and thus 30 day average are now calculated incorrectly. Today for example I was 67, 167, and 119. Making the daily average 117. The app says after I put in the 119 that my daily went from 115 to 134.  This makes no sense and is incorrect. The 30 day on my meter is 112, same readings entered into the app and the app says 130. Very annoying. I'll be looking for a new app despite liking the other features.   I've been type 1 for 50 years now--this is the best program i have found so far--simple to use and only what's needed to help keep things in control.  Only wish it came combined  with a program like fit day that had food carb values so i only had to use one program.",
            "I highly recommend this app. It is by far the best app I've tried for man aging my diabetes. I now have:  • an extensive database of foods I      eat that are cutomised to featuring my key information  • the ability to easily work out how much insulin to bolus as the app calculations are customised to match my known sensitivity variations throughout the day  • a graph tracking my trends making it simple to see if I need to make any adjustments for improved management of my blood glucose.  I have been using this app for several months now and it does everything I need it to. As a result I can make informed decisions which have improved my overall diabetes management markedly."

The reports, and the \"Follow\" feature are a huge plus. Blue Circle team periodically keeps adding many new features that I and other users have requested for which makes it all the more valuable. If you or your loved ones are living with Diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, LADA or any other), download the app now!",

I am a t1 since 10 years and was always searching for a decent app to manage my sugar levels Now, i am able to share my blood sugar with family, Log my meals, exercise and sugar levels......And the best part is the reports i can generate in the app! This app has definately made my life simpler! :)",

At 10:00 p.m. when I was updating the Bg and insulin dose in Bluecircle app, I suddenly remembered that she hasn't taken insulin so I immediately woke her up and gave her the insulin... I am very much thankful to this bluecircle team. This is really helpful for I get to know the average blood sugar of a single day and I can work on where I am lacking.",

            "Just received the unit from Dr. So far unable to pair it with phone. The phone sees it and will pair, but the meter will not reciprocate. It's stuck looking for the phone. The meter stays on 'enter pin number' until it shuts down. Also, the manual talks about using a calibration solution, which was not included. Rapidly losing confidence in the thing. I mean if they didn't bother to ensure the paring works, nor did they provide for its calibration. I'm beginning to wonder what the point is.",
            "Glitchy app, it gives me false readings or doesn't even sync to my phone and i have to manually input my readings. I've used 2 different meters, side by side and both gave my totally different readings this app being the worst. I tested twice within a 15 min time span before breakfast, my other unnamed meter gave me semi the same readings around the same mg/dL but Accu-chek readings both were different the first one was 131 and the other was 106 not 15 minutes later during my fasting.",
            "I'm reading some of the reviews and I'm having similar problems. When it downloads I love the layout the information is easy to review and I wish it did a better job of showing you more than 7 days. The problem is, like others, it's not wanting to forward the information to my phone. It's an ongoing problem I generally work around and reconnect. Now it's been a week of not reconnecting. I've done troubleshooting that's corrected it before and really need to be able to review my numbers.",
            "Easy to use app once connected. The only problem was getting it to actually pair with my device. My phone had no problem seeing and connecting to the meter but when I tried to do it within the app it kept failing. After many tries I finally closed everything and gave up. Came back a short time later and tried again then it magically worked. It's only been a couple days but the info seems to be sent to my phone app seamlessly now. Fingers crossed it keeps working.",
            "The Bluetooth connection has suddenly stopped working. I have restarted the app, repaired the meter with my phone, but to no avail. I set up an online account and never got the confirmation email. UPDATE 8/27/20. I found that the data transfer works if I open the app before taking the reading. Otherwise, seems to be working OK."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I purchased the premium version only to find out it doesn't sync with my Samsung active 2 or samsung health It's a decent app to track your macros which I was doing fine in the free version. The app is confusing and requires a lot of extra input if you wanna use the premium features. The recipes are typically off on the macros. Also, there are often several options to choose an item to add, for ex \"egg\", and when you open it, it might be \"taco soup\". I regret purchasing the premium version.",
            "The app is simple and VERY helpful, especially if you are beginning your Keto journey like me. I love how the graphics help me monitor my progress. I've lost my first 5 lbs and I honestly feel this app has definitely supported me in doing this. I'm surprised I didn't quit using the app like I've done before with other apps. Give it a try. I'm SO GLAD I did :)",
            "This is absolutely a keto must have. I can't believe how good the food database is. I love that you can copy meals to multiple days and log your food diary for the week all in one shot on meal prep day! I noticed theres some kind of glitch scrolling through the values when you log a food. For example, when I indicate how many grams of avocado I'd like, sometimes the number value disappears if I scroll too fast and I need to go backward out of that food and back into it to make it work.",

Would have given 5 stars but the app is painfully slow to load. To the Developers of this app. Please do something about how slow it is to load. I'll change my review if you can do this Cheers",

        "description": "Diabetes, type 1: An autoimmune disease that occurs when T cells attack and destroy most of the beta cells in the pancreas that are needed to produce insulin, so that the pancreas makes too little insulin (or no insulin). Without the capacity to make adequate amounts of insulin, the body is not able to metabolize blood glucose (sugar), to use it efficiently for energy, and toxic acids (called ketoacids) build up in the body. There is a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe disease tends to occur in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood (before age 30) but it may have its clinical onset at any age. The symptoms and signs of type 1 diabetes characteristically appear abruptly, although the damage to the beta cells may begin much earlier and progress slowly and silently.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and signs include a great thirst, hunger, a need to urinate often, and loss of weight. Among the risks of the disease are serious complications, among them blindness, kidney failure, extensive nerve damage, and accelerated atherosclerosis. The long-term aim with treatment is to avoid these complications or, at the least, to slow their progression. There is no known cure.\r\n\r\nTo treat the disease, the person must inject insulin, follow a diet plan, exercise adequately (ideally, daily), and test their blood glucose several times a day.\r\n\r\nThis type of diabetes used to be known as \"juvenile diabetes,\" \"juvenile-onset diabetes,\" and \"ketosis-prone diabetes.\" It is now called type 1 diabetes mellitus or insulin-dependent diabetes.\r\n\r\nDon't be too alarmed with the aid of those questions, your medical doctor isn’t prying.

        "description": "WHAT IS TYPE 2 DIABETES?\r\n\r\nType 2 Diabetes is a condition which occurs when the body is no longer able to deal with the increasing level of glucose (sugar) in the blood.\r\n\r\nNormally when we eat food, in particular carbohydrates (starches and sugars) the level of glucose in our blood increases. In response to this the pancreas produces insulin which brings the level of glucose back to normal. Insulin is a hormone which is produced by a small organ in the body called the pancreas.\r\n\r\nIn a person with Type 2 Diabetes the body may not produce enough insulin or the insulin produced may not work as effectively as it should. This is referred to as insulin resistance. Being overweight increases insulin resistance.\r\n\r\nBoth the lack of insulin and the insulin resistance mean that the glucose levels are poorly controlled. It is important to keep the blood glucose within normal limits as poorly controlled diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys and the nerves and can also contribute to cardio-vascular disease (CVD) which includes heart disease, stroke and poor circulation. \r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES\r\n\r\nTreatment of Type 2 Diabetes requires that you follow a healthy lifestyle which includes following healthy eating guidelines and taking regular activity.\r\n\r\nAs most people with Type 2 Diabetes are overweight it is important that you lose weight gradually. Losing 1-2 lbs a week is a safe amount to lose. Weighing yourself once a week means you can monitor your progress.\r\n\r\nAs well as healthy eating and physical activity you may be prescribed tablets to control your diabetes. Diabetes is a progressive condition and in some cases taking tablets is not enough\r\n\r\nto maintain or achieve good control and it may be necessary for your doctor to start you on insulin. \r\n\r\nDiabetes can be treated by:\r\n\r\n    Healthy eating and regular activity\r\n    Healthy eating, regular activity and tablets\r\n    Healthy eating, regular activity and insulin\r\n\r\nAIM OF TREATMENT\r\n\r\nWhen you see your doctor he/she will decide what treatment is best for you. The aim of your treatment will be to keep your blood glucose levels within normal limits, this means keeping your blood glucose between 4-8mmol/L. To keep the blood glucose at a normal level it is necessary for you to follow healthy eating guidelines. \r\n\r\nDiabetes Facts: did you know?\r\n\r\nPeople with diabetes have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which includes heart disease and stroke.\r\n\r\nHeart disease affects people with diabetes twice as often as people without diabetes.\r\n\r\nPeople with diabetes are 2-4 times more likely to suffer strokes and once having had a stroke are 2-4 times more likely to have a recurrence.\r\n\r\nRemember, these risks are due to poorly controlled diabetes, if glucose levels are kept within the normal range all these risks are reduced.",

            "Pretty useful app, I like the way everything is organized, presenting the statistics is easy and intuitive. There is Bluetooth compatibility with my glucometer and that makes is really easy to pass my measurements to the app. The user interface is easy and the app is polished in general. Good job.",
            "Almost perfect app for diabetic users. Over all this is a very good program to keep track of your blood sugar, BP, weight, etc... Works fine on Android 8 and 9 with Huawei Mate 10 Pro and Mate 20 Pro. The only problem which I found on Android 9 pie is that fordiabetes Continuously scans for Bluetooth in background.Looks like when you exit app app stay opened in background. Sometimes app don't sync with my Contour Next One no matter that I try also manually to sync my reading on Contour. But most important for me is they have great support. You send mail to support team and you receive answer almost immediately no matter is the working day or not. The best support I seen over last years. On Progress page you can see Weekly and Monthly Average but not Yearly or at least 3 month Average which is important for HbA1c. Statistic can be better. Today the most important things are statistical data. From those data we can see our progress.  Till today I tried many diabetes app but this one is almost perfect. Keep going on this way, you do very good job. Sorry for my English. It is not so perfect like your app.",
            "The app helped me track down my measurements corellated to my diabetes. Really helpfull seeing my progress since downloading the app",
            "Really helped me balance my blood sugar levels. Pretty useful app.",
            "Overall a smooth good looking app. However it's disappointing the Google sync is to sync activities instead of also syncing blood pressure or glucose via custom data type."

Search:\r\n\r\nIncreased thirst\r\nfrequent urination\r\nIncrease hunger\r\nWeight loss unintentionally\r\nfatigue\r\nFoggy vision\r\nSlow healing of sores\r\nFrequent infections\r\nAreas of dark skin, usually in the armpits and neck.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a doctor\r\n\r\nConsult your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nthe reasons\r\n\r\nType 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes insulin-resistant or when the pancreas can not produce enough insulin. The exact cause of this is unknown, although genetic and environmental factors, such as weight gain and inactivity, seem to be contributing factors.\r\nHow Insulin works\r\n\r\nInsulin is a hormone that comes from the gland located behind and under the stomach (pancreas).\r\n\r\nThe pancreas secrete insulin in the bloodstream.\r\nInsulin circulates and allows sugar to enter the cells.\r\nInsulin reduces the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.\r\nWith low blood sugar, the secretion of insulin from the pancreas is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe role of glucose.\r\n\r\nGlucose, sugar, is a major source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and other tissues.\r\n\r\nGlucose comes from two main sources: food and liver.\r\nSugar is absorbed into the blood stream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\r\nThe liver stores and produces glucose.\r\nWhen glucose levels are low, such as not eaten for a long time, the glycogen-stored liver breaks down in glucose to maintain a normal glucose level.\r\n\r\nIn type 2 diabetes, this process does not work well. Instead of moving to cells, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream. As blood sugar levels rise, insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells deteriorate and can not produce enough insulin to meet the body's requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the first type of diabetes, which is less common, the immune system mistakenly destroys beta cells, leaves the body without insulin or does not contain any type of insulin.\r\nRisk factors\r\n\r\nFactors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:\r\n\r\nthe weight. Weight gain is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, you do not have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.\r\nFat distribution. If you store fat mainly in the abdomen, you have a risk of type 2 diabetes compared to storing fat elsewhere, such as hips and thighs. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if you are a man with a circumference of more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) or a woman with a waist greater than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters).\r\nIdle. The lower your activity, the higher your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.\r\nFamily history The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your father or brother has type 2 diabetes.\r\nProfession. Although it is not clear why, people of certain races, including blacks, Latins, American Indians and Asian Americans, are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites.\r\nYears. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after the age of 45. This may be because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they get older. However, type 2 diabetes is increasing significantly among children, adolescents and young people.\r\nIntroduction to diabetes.

The best results are achieved when you as a pet owner record all things that are important indicators of success or failure. The diabetes management can be fine-tuned on the basis of these, avoiding complications associated with low and high blood sugars, as well as the costs associated with such complications.\r\n\r\nThis free app was designed by pet diabetes expert Dr Stijn Niessen of the Royal Veterinary College, University of London, UK. He designed the app for two main reasons: \r\n\r\n1. To provide diabetic pet owners with a convenient free tool to actively participate in the medical management of their beloved pet; \r\n\r\n2. To enable the gathering of strictly anonymous data on diabetic pets and their management. This enables diabetic pet owners to actively participate in research and help develop better treatment options for pets with diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe Diabetes Log feature of the app allows users to record, and easily share with their veterinarian, all those parameters that are essential to keep an eye on when it comes to pet diabetes management; they include: clinical signs like weight, appetite, thirst and urination changes, as well as urine and blood sugar values (for those owners who perform home blood or urine glucose testing).\r\n\r\nThe app also features the following:\r\n• a medication reminder function\r\n• a reminder to change the insulin injection sites (avoiding inflammation of areas too frequently used)\r\n• a scientifically validated tool which calculates and monitors quality of life\r\n• a scientifically validated tool to score your pet’s clinical signs\r\n• a tool to calculate the number of calories your diabetic pet likely needs\r\n• a tool to calculate the exact amount of food your diabetic pet likely needs\r\n• plenty of space to enter and keep save useful information (e.g. contact details of your veterinarian, important medical history, questions for your veterinarian, etc.)\r\n• visualisation of trends (using graphs), including changes in thirst, weight, fructosamine, average blood sugar values, urine ketones or sugar values, etc.\r\n• links to useful pet diabetes videos\r\n• an easy “export” function enabling the sharing of entered information and graphs with anyone interested, including your veterinarian.  \r\n\r\nSo, take control of your pet’s diabetes and start logging entries into the Diabetes Log.

            "If the developer would debug this app it would have great potential. I gave it four stars because I like the concept and would have given at 5 if they fixed the bugs. Like others have said the day of the week is off by a day. If you log something in error there is no way to correct it or delete one entry. Typing on a small keyboard on one's cell phone, it is fairly easy to make typos. Example. If you enter an incorrect number of a glucose reading into the log the only way to fix it is to delete the entire log for that day, and rekey EVERYTHING which means you're deleting anything and everything that you have entered for that day. Then you have to start over. How stupid is that? There does not appear to be a method to enter a log with a previous date. If I am doing a glucose curve on my dog, I don't go to my phone to update the app 10 different times a day. I want to enter it all at once when time allows. I may not get to that for a day or two and in that case I need to be able to create a log that has a past date. Other enhancements that would be good 1. Automatically populate the type of insulin and dose by carrying-forward from the last entry, but also allow it to be edited. Most dogs are on the same insulin type and dose day after day. 2. same description as number 1 above, however relating to the food quantity. Again most diabetic dogs eat the same amount and type of food day after day. I don't want to have to enter that every day. It should carry forward.",
            "Right this is a really helpful app, however the one most annoying problem which is why you don't get full five stars is the monitoring tab and date. For some reason when you input a date the app defaults to the current date and then won't accept changing that date to another day. I wanted to input previous readings but it's not allowing me to do that. I would add screenshots but I don't know how. The interface is good but could be a little more fluid in it's design. Also I've tried this on two separate devices and the 01.10.2018 won't allow me to save as a valid date. No matter what it claims its an invalid date.",
            "Excellent tool to monitor, record data and export as PDF documents. The app is certainly comprehensive but easy enough to navigate after \"looking around\" on it for a while. One comment I'd add - it could do with a mention (in the \"About the app\" section) of how to delete an incorrect log entry. I finally discovered how, by accident - \"swipe left\" on the saved entry, & click on the red \"X\" that appears. I recommend the app to anyone who has a pet with diabetes.",
            "Such a great app, my dog has diabetes so keeping a log has made life so much easier especially as I have short term memory loss. Ideal for when you have to do your glucose curve at home and the ability to send the graph directly to your vet is great",
            "I just started using this app to track my dogs diabetes and i love it. The only downside is that whenever I make a new diary entry the day is always stuck on the day I started using the app and wont save the date when I change it."

        "description": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose) an important source of fuel for your body.\r\n\r\nWith type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.\r\n\r\nType 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but today more children are being diagnosed with the disorder, probably due to the rise in childhood obesity.

Maintaining a low carb diet is great for weight loss. Moreover, according to an increasing number of studies, a low carb diet helps reduce risk factors for diabetes, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, and more!\r\n\r\nWHY REDUCE CARBS ON A KETO DIET?\r\n\r\nWe’re beginning to understand that carbs in large quantities are more harmful than previously thought, while most fats are healthy & essential (the basis of a low carb diet).\r\n\r\nWhen you eat lots of carbs, your blood sugar is consistently elevated and, as a result, so is insulin. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.\r\n\r\nThis insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nA keto diet can reverse these harmful effects & restores insulin sensitivity.\r\n\r\nTHE KETO DIET IS A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!\r\n\r\nThe nutritional landscape is changing. The keto diet (low carb diet) is growing in acceptance and a nutritional revolution is beginning. We are starting to realize the detrimental effects of our relationship with excess sugar & carbs.\r\n\r\nThe keto diet focuses on low carb recipes to keep your blood sugar stable, helping your body regain insulin sensitivity and keeping your mood & energy levels stable.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re on a ketogenic diet, you can expect to:\r\n\r\n• Lose body fat\r\n• Have consistent energy levels during the day\r\n• Stay satiated after meals longer, with less snacking and overeating\r\n\r\nHUNDREDS OF LOW CARB DIET & KETO RECIPES!\r\n\r\nKeto recipes make you feel better, live better and eat better. Each low carb recipe is delicious – we know because we only share the ones we love.\r\n\r\nWe’ve included hundreds of low carb recipes for you to choose from. The main goal of these low carb recipes is to:\r\n\r\n• Keep carbs low – under 25g a day, ideally\r\n• Increase your protein intake – aim for at least 60g a day\r\n• Keep you full and satiated from delicious meals\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNER'S KETO DIET GUIDE INCLUDES:\r\n\r\n• What is the Keto Diet?\r\n• Testing for Ketosis\r\n• The Truth About Fat\r\n• What are Macronutrients?\r\n• Long-term Benefits of the Ketogenic Diet\r\n• Day-to-Day Benefits\r\n• Entering Ketosis\r\n• Diabetes and Ketoacidosis\r\n• What is the Keto Flu; why it happens and how to end it\r\n• And more to help you with your keto diet\r\n\r\nLow carb keto diet questions or feedback?

        "description": "Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.\r\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems.

        "descriptionHTML": "Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.<br>Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems.

There is scientific evidence to support both approaches, so which one should you follow? Well, it turns out that both are important!\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that calories are important, but not everyone knows that when you eat those calories you can do three things with them: burn them for energy; store them as fat; or use them to build lean body mass.\r\n\r\nWhat you do with those calories is determined by hormones in your body, the most important being insulin. Your insulin level is determined not only by the number of calories you eat, but also by the type of calories you eat. \r\n\r\nThis is why what you eat (glycemic load) is as important as how much you eat (calories)!\r\n\r\nThe Low-Glycal Diet™ app by BioFit uses both glycemic load and calories to calculate the number of “glycals” in a meal, which is a better predictor of how fattening that meal will be. \r\n\r\nThe “glycal” is calculated from a formula developed by Dr. Jeffrey S. Dunham, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., medical director of BioFit Medical Group and graduate of Harvard Medical School, and is based on the latest medical research. \r\n\r\nThe total number of glycals in a meal equals the total number of calories in a meal that will be stored as fat.\r\n\r\nThe Low-Glycal Diet™ app by BioFit contains over 1000 easy-to-find foods which are color coded as green (low-glycal), yellow (medium-glycal), or red (high-glycal) if eaten alone. \r\n\r\nYou assemble a meal by choosing the individual foods in that meal. The app then calculates the total number of glycals in that meal and gives you a green, yellow or red result. \r\n\r\nThe number of glycals will change depending on how you pair foods together. For example, eating two fried eggs (a green food) with two slices of cheddar cheese (a green food) will give you a green meal, but eating two fried eggs with two slices of dry whole wheat toast (a green food) will give you a red meal. \r\n\r\nThe ranges of green, yellow and red also change depending on when you have the meal, since eating carbohydrates after 6PM can be more fattening than eating them in earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nYou never have to be hungry on The Low-Glycal Diet™ by BioFit. You can have all the green meals you want in a day, as long as they are separated by two hours. You’re allowed one yellow meal a day and one red meal a week. \r\n\r\nThe fat loss is almost effortless, so start losing fat today!",

Currently you can't find the foods you're actually eating. Just a thought. It is good enough to give you a ballpark idea of what type of carb calories you are consuming to keep you on track with your ketogenic diet.",

This is a permanent life change that I believe will undo years of sugar overload damage as well. THANK YOU SO MUCH,  DR DUNHAM!!!! Bless you for giving me the key to finally lose the weight and hopefully get me off medication. You rock!",

        "description": "When you have diabetes, a primary goal is to keep it under control. Here are some simple things you can do each day to help achieve that goal.\r\n\r\nExercise\r\nRegular physical activity helps you feel better. It also improves your sensitivity to insulin, which means it works better in your body. Because it does, your blood sugar levels can become more stable.\r\n\r\nExercise can also help ease stress.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't active now, start slow. Then build up how much exercise you get over time. Shoot for 4 to 7 periods of activity each week. Try to make each period last for at least 30 minutes. And you don't have to work out at the gym to be active. Take the stairs instead of an elevator, or park at the far end of the lot. Both add exercise to your daily routine.\r\n\r\nHave a realistic goal and make a plan. What exercises will you do, and when will you do them? For example, you might plan to walk 30 minutes most days on your lunch break.\r\n\r\nChange your activities often enough so you don't get bored. You can do aerobic activities like walking or jogging. And resistance exercises like working out with weights offer another option. Whatever you do, don't forget to stretch before and after each workout session.\r\n\r\nIt's important to realize that exercise lowers your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to adjust your meds or insulin dose to keep your levels high enough.\r\n\r\nEat a Well-Balanced Diet\r\nHaving diabetes shouldn't keep you from enjoying a bunch of different foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to fill half your plate with non-starchy vegetables such as:\r\n\r\nAsparagus\r\nBroccoli\r\nCarrot\r\nCucumber\r\nSalad greens\r\nSquash\r\nTomato\r\nYou can also get protein from vegetarian things like tofu.\r\n\r\nStick to whole-grain foods. If you eat cereals, check the ingredients and make sure whole grain is first on the list.\r\n\r\nExamples of whole grains include:\r\n\r\nBrown rice\r\nBulgur (cracked wheat)\r\nReduce Stress\r\nIf you're stressed, you may exercise less, drink more, and not watch your diabetes as closely.\r\n\r\nStress can raise your blood sugar and make you less sensitive to insulin. When you're stressed, your body adopts a \"fight or flight\" response. That means it will make sure you have enough sugar and fat available for energy.\r\n\r\nStudies of people with type 1 diabetes found blood sugar levels go up for most people under mental stress and down for others. If you have type 2 diabetes and you're feeling pressure, your glucose will go up.",

            "FINALLY! my dr wanted me to keep a log for a week of food and BG because i had to go off my Lantus as it was giving me too many low lows. I have no appetite. I blame this on being stuck at home 24/7 because of covid. I was taking 60 units a day. Dropped it to 30 units and now none. So i tried at least a dozen apps. This one fits what i need. Plain and simple, easy to use. Thank you.",
            "Thank you, I love this App it works on all levels no issues easy to use and it's free unlike others who charge you to use certain parts. I do recommend the app you won't be sorry. Thank you so much again for making my life easier.",
            "Easiest Blood Glucose Logbook that I have used ⭐ Best out of six so far ⭐ BG tracking is super intuitive ⭐ Result entry is ridiculously straightforward ⭐ Excellent choice of entry times ⭐ Results export is flawless ⭐ For folks with non-bluetooth BG meters this app is a must ⭐ I wish that I had tried this app first - would have saved a lot of grief. Thank you for making this excellent app available and thank you for your work and effort in creating it. Very grateful🙏",
            "Great app nice and easy to use. Would be awesome if you could log a note to record what foods you ate etc",
            "This looks great and has everything I want except we must be able to store the readings as we're given them. We need to be able to change the settings from lbs to kg for weight for example. My cholesterol is given to me as xx.xx for example. I want this app but can't use it as it is. I'll keep it installed so I can try future updates though."

We have protocols for Acupressure, Acupuncture, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Bach Flower Remedy, Color Therapy, Diet and Nutrition, Exercise, Herbal Therapy, Juice Therapy, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Shiatsu, Sound Therapy, Tai Chi, TCM, Vitamin Therapy, Yoga, Sujok, Auricular Therapy, Hydrotherapy, Rife Therapy, Visualization, Reiki, Magnet Therapy. These protocols when used under proper guidance gives more better feeling and as all the protocols are complementary / alternative therapy it comes with no side effects on application. For one problem – Diabetes, this app provides you many different methods of alternative remedies to manage your blood sugar level and that to absolutely FREE!!! \r\n\r\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well or insulin resistance. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.\r\n Learn about Diabetes symptoms, causes and treatment  from this App. What diet sugar patient should follow? Maintaining, controlling blood sugar levels is part of managing diabetes. Doctors often prescribe traditional treatments, like insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels normal. Some people with diabetes also use complementary and alternative therapies (CAM). These therapies aim to treat the body and the mind.\r\n This App gives information on Diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, gestational diabetes, diabetes related weight, hypertension / blood pressure, treatment and guidelines.\r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your diabetes, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage your diabetes is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in managing diabetes with alternative techniques.\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments. \r\n \r\nThis app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your blood sugar levels and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care.",

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

Who would have an idea as absurd as making a fridge just to carry medication? It took a particular set of circumstances, linking technical knowhow, a personal need, and a heat wave to make it possible.\r\n\r\nEverything begins in France in 2016. Mr. Uwe DIEGEL, managing director of a medical business in Paris is expecting the visit from New Zealand of his diabetic brother, Dr. Olaf Diegel. The two men have already built strong international reputations in the field of industrial design and healthcare and quite often work together on new research projects. Olaf, diabetic since the age of 17, is professor of industrial design at the Auckland Technology University. His job forces him to travel a lot to take part in international congresses. He is a well-versed traveler and is used to travelling with his insulin and keeping it cool using iceboxes and cooler bags (insulin, like many other medications, is sensitive to heat and should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 8°C).\r\n\r\nOlaf books himself into a small hotel near Auxerres in France. When he arrives at the hotel, he notices that there is no fridge in his hotel room (even though he had particularly insisted on this when making his booking). He needs a fridge to store his insulin. So he arranges with the clerk at the entrance desk to keep his insulin in the fridge in the kitchen.\r\nOlaf does not speak French, coming from New Zealand. A few hours later, Olaf needs his insulin and goes down to reception to ask for it, only to discover that it was placed in the freezer by accident by someone in the kitchen. He is thus obliged to have the night pharmacy opened just to get some fresh insulin. Luckily, the problem is resolved easily enough thanks to the wonderful efficiency of the French pharmacy system.\r\n\r\nBack in Paris, Olaf meets is brother and they discuss the events. They decide to design the idea of a portable fridge that would use a Peltier Effect to create cold without gas or moving parts. On paper, the idea should in theory work, so they decide to make a rough prototype using whatever they had available at the time (the battery was stolen from Uwe’s video camera).\r\nThe prototype actually works quite well, so the two brothers decide to start the Lifeina company.\r\n\r\nToday, we are proud to announce the launch of LifeinaBox, a device that will revolutionize the transport of medication worldwide. LifeinaBox, the world’s smallest fridge, is the culmination of many years of research to produce a universal solution that will allow users to travel any place, any time, knowing that their medication is kept at exactly the right temperature. Suitable for any heat-sensitive medication such as insulin, growth hormones, arthritis or multiple sclerosis medications, it allows users the freedom to travel anywhere, anytime, knowing that their medication is kept at exactly the right temperature.",

In other words, you begin to feel better than you have in years!\r\n\r\nAt the same time, your body stops storing fat and instead begins burning fat for energy while increasing your metabolism.

Also maybe on front page show owner, doctor name and type insulin/meds taken.  Otherwise I've checked out other programs and this is the only one that I liked. With the above added would make this app most super.  Update:    Been using it for several days now! Works! I have been having no problems with the app. I decided that I may have under rated the app so I'll give it 4 stars instead of the 3.

            "Extremely easy to use. Makes logging food fast. Very helpful in keeping up with your macro counts.",

            "Great app - love the scan feature. I do wish it was more intuitive for food entry and that you had the option to change something once you've entered it. I will often enter everything I plan to eat *before* I eat it to make sure I don't inadvertently exceed my allotments, but sometimes don't finish it all. If there is a way to do this I haven't found it, but it could be user error. 🤷‍♀️"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Android Phone? - Don't Bother! Being taught to use this app in the hospital to manage my newly diagnostic child, I was horrified to find that once discharged from the hospital and left to \"go solo\", everything that I had learnt was void as the app you rely so heavily on, doesn't actually work on android. Extremely disappointed that I paid my money in good faith for this app, only to discover that it does not have half the foods and you cannot change your weights to get exact carbohydrates.",
            "Last update was 2018, no replies to emails! This is very lazy and evidences a lack in development. Many common foods are missing or it is fussy regarding food names. This could easily be resolved with more variables and again evidences lazy development. It's also slow to use and states \"downloading\" every time launched. The included basal bolus system is useless, you have to manually calculate carbs and there isn't anywhere to input a correction ratio, or reduction ratios for exercise etc.",
            "Good idea but outdated. Given the current technology this app could be improved further. For example, link with online database, such as calories king and so on. Healthcare workers encouraged me to use the app, but I don't find myself beneficial from it because the database is limited.",
            "I saw thought that this app would be Perfect for helping me to control my type 1 diabetes but it just does not contain enough info on uk foods. I therefore, cannot give a higher rating. Check out weights of anything on toast 737g not! When will you update and rectify. This is , after all, a paid for app.",
            "Brilliant app was recommended to get it by doctor at the hospital as I'm diabetic to help me count carbs on what I eat and it's great, it also tells you the fat content, calories and protein for different portion sizes on quite a range of different foods and takeaways. Would definitely recommend"

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

In fact, fat and protein counting is not as important as carbohydrate counting is. But that doesn&#39;t mean you should not be careful enough about the fat or protein intake. High calorie and high fat always increase the risk of various health complications including cardiac problems, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.<br><br>Diabetic Diet and Sweets Consumption<br><br>The fact says if you are suffering from diabetes, all your near and dear ones continuously warn you not to have sweets in your diet. Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies confirmed that sweets may not produce any harm if it can be used in a balanced amount in the meal plan. Although, different sweets affect blood sugar level in a varied fashion, but the total carbohydrate count matters the most. If you consider a small amount of sweets in your overall diabetic diet plan, it will not harm your health.<br><br>Download Diabetic Diet Plan now for more information.",

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",

            "I really enjoy playing this game but I wish that it went up in levels instead of just continuing 1 game and u constantly repeating it or trying to get a higher score. Plus a good idea would be to have like maybe 2 games going at once and it just keep getting harder but it is very fun cuz I have sat here and played it n I don't get bored with it yet and I've been playin about a good hour now.",
            "Great design. No freezing or app closing in the middle of a game...However, app stops giving you dollars and gives you cents instead. UNTIL...you get to the last .20 cents of the game. It then gives you nothing so you can not reach the pay out goal. If i could give zero stars, i would. What a rip off and waste of time. And to think I shared this game with friends and family as one of best payout games on the market.",
            "Love the game!❤❤ I play it for hours and don't get bored with it at all! The only time I do actually stop is when my battery is dead (I hate when that happens) and when that does happen thankfully my progress saves for the next time I want to play. It's the best game ever, the only thing that would make it better is that if it had some levels or daily challenges at least, but still the BEST GAME EVER!!! Keep up the great work!😁",
            "I wish this was more enjoyable. WHERE ARE THE SETTINGS? Can I turn off volume? Turn off vibrate, etc. Ads after EVERYTHING. Pausing, getting a combo, starting new, sometimes 2 ads after resuming from a pause. Ugh! I understand ads, but this is too much. To be honest I may be more apt to pay for Ad free if I could access settings to actually play without having to adjust the volume on my phone.",
            "The game itself is a lot of fun. The ads make it basically unplayable. The game makers need to make an income, sure. But I've played plenty of f2p stuff that pulls off ads without being so pervasive. For context, I was getting an ad every 2-3 numbers dropped."
